      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives reasons based on the geographical
        locations of the two cities, indicating that Orlando is not south of Denver
        because Colorado is generally north of Florida.

        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it provides reasoning based on the geographical locations
        of Orlando and Denver, indicating that Orlando is not south of Denver because
        Colorado is generally north of Florida.

        False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Denver is north
        of Orlando, which implies a difference in their positions. The "NO" answer
        appears to contradict this reasoning, but we must evaluate based solely on
        what is explicitly stated, not resolve contradictions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Beverly Hills is both south
        and west of Manhattan, but emphasizes that the primary directional difference
        is west. This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
