      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO. Therefore, according
        to the instructions, we must answer False to this question regardless of the
        content of the explanation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially made a mistake by saying "NO",
        but then corrected itself and explicitly stated "YES, John Adams died at an
        earlier date than J.P. Morgan." This final statement is a clear and explicit
        YES answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the dates are different (1826
        vs 1913) and that John Adams died at an earlier date than J.P. Morgan.

        Diego Maradona died in 2020, with Parks dying at an earlier date. The NO answer
        is not due to equal values, but because the question's premise (that Maradona
        died before Parks) is false.

        compared are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Rosa Parks died
        earlier (2005) than Diego Maradona (2020), which is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear negative response to the question of whether Rosa
        Parks died at a later date than Diego Maradona.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (dates of
        death) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Rosa Parks died approximately
        15 years earlier than Diego Maradona, which is a difference in values and
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Rosa Parks did not
        die at a later date than Diego Maradona. She died earlier." This is a clear

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Peter I died earlier (in 1725) than Archduke

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Peter I did not die

        Franz Ferdinand died in 1914, noting that 1725 is earlier than 1914. The NO
        answer is not due to equal values, but rather because Peter I died at an earlier

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but it's not
        because the values being compared are the same. The model clearly states that
        Nixon died in 1994 and Pavarotti died in 2007, indicating a difference in
        the dates. The NO answer is given because Nixon died at an earlier date than
        Pavarotti, not because the dates are equal.
