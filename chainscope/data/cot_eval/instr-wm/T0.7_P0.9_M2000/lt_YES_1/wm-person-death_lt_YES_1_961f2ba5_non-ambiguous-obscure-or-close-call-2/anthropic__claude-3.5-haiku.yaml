        Jackson." The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. While this appears to

        The NO appears to be a logical error given the model's own reasoning, but
        we must evaluate based on what was stated, not what is correct.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        before Oswald's birth (1939), indicating a clear difference in timing. The
        NO appears to be because the premise was incorrect (Peter did not die earlier

        were different (1725 vs 1963). The NO answer appears to be based on other
        reasoning (though contradictory), not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

        reasoning, as it states "1725 is earlier than 1963" but then concludes "Piotr
        I did NOT die at an earlier date than Lee Harvey Oswald." Despite this contradiction,

        this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer appears to be based
        on a logical error (saying NO when finding that one date IS earlier than the
        other), but we must evaluate only what was stated, not whether it's logical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was discussed (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after comparing the dates and determining that 2011 is earlier than 2020.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final answer, both in its step-by-step reasoning ("the answer is YES") and
        as a final standalone "YES" at the end.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
