        the values are equal. The model clearly shows that the total runtime for The
        Hobbit (474 minutes) is longer than Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (276
        minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that The Hobbit is significantly longer than
        Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (474 minutes vs 276 minutes). The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Harry Potter and

        It clearly indicates that "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro" has a longer runtime (132 minutes)
        compared to "Fifty Shades" (125 minutes), and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.
