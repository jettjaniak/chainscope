        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Aashiqui (149
        minutes) is longer than The Grudge (91-92 minutes), which is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question "Is Mahesh Bhatt's Aashiqui shorter than Takashi
        Shimizu's The Grudge?" The model provides a clear comparison and reasoning
        for this answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. It clearly states that Aashiqui (149 minutes) is longer
        than The Grudge (91-92 minutes), showing a difference in runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that Mahesh Bhatt's Aashiqui is NOT shorter
        than Takashi Shimizu's The Grudge.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Aashiqui (150
        minutes) is longer than The Grudge (92 minutes). The model explicitly notes
        a difference in the running times of the two movies.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Mahesh Bhatt's Aashiqui shorter than Takashi Shimizu's
        The Grudge?" The model provides a clear comparative result, stating that Aashiqui
        is not shorter than The Grudge.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. The model clearly states that Aashiqui is longer than
        The Grudge, with a runtime difference of about 54-59 minutes. The model explicitly
        mentions that Aashiqui is "significantly longer" than The Grudge.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Mahesh Bhatt's Aashiqui shorter than Takashi Shimizu's
        The Grudge?" The model provides a clear comparative result, stating that Aashiqui
        is not shorter, but in fact significantly longer than The Grudge.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fe50c211-1fb3-4990-8a2d-62f4d8fd244a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared are the same. The model clearly states that Aashiqui
        has a runtime of approximately 149-150 minutes, while The Grudge has a runtime
        of 91-92 minutes. The NO answer is given because Aashiqui is longer, not because
        the runtimes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question asked. The model concludes
        that Aashiqui is not shorter than The Grudge, but rather longer.
