        Instead, it clearly indicates that The Hobbit is longer than Harry Potter
        and the Deathly Hallows, providing specific runtime comparisons (276 minutes
        vs 474 minutes). The NO answer is given because The Hobbit is longer, not

        It clearly identifies different runtimes (169 minutes vs 91 minutes) and concludes
        that Andaz Apna Apna is not shorter than The Grudge because 169 minutes is
        greater than 91 minutes.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that "Andaz Apna Apna" has a longer runtime

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (runtimes)
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that "Aashiqui" (150 minutes) is
        longer than "The Grudge" (92 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in runtime, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as the final answer
        to whether Mahesh Bhatt's "Aashiqui" is shorter than Takashi Shimizu's "The
        Grudge". This is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e093db53-f7de-4d37-afd1-42d33b235f8b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly identifies a difference in runtime (149 minutes for Aashiqui
        vs. 91 minutes for The Grudge) and concludes that Aashiqui is longer than
        The Grudge.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating a clear comparative result.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
