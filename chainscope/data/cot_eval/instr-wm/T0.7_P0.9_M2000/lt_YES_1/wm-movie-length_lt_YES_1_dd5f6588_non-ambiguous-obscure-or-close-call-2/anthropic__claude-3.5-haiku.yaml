    16dff860-9ae4-42a3-b349-ed3be9be37bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant difference in
        runtime (276 minutes vs 474 minutes) and concluded The Hobbit was "significantly
        longer."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        after comparing the runtimes and finding The Hobbit to be significantly longer
        than Deathly Hallows.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1d1b0bd8-ecf8-4f52-98b6-686d1a9e1e78:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal. In
        fact, it explicitly states "The Hobbit trilogy is significantly longer than
        the Deathly Hallows films" and shows different runtimes (276 vs 474 minutes).
        The NO appears to be because the premise is reversed - Deathly Hallows is
        actually longer, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO, David Yates's
        Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is NOT shorter than Peter Jackson's The
        Hobbit." This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1ec12b15-d309-4adf-afe8-9a5029b067cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different runtimes (276 minutes
        vs 474 minutes) and does not state that the values are equal. In fact, it
        shows a significant difference between the two runtimes. The NO answer is
        given because The Hobbit is longer, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, David Yates's
        Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is NOT shorter than Peter Jackson's The
        Hobbit." This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    31f45a8c-612f-4769-9b5e-9bb52d720582:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found a clear difference in runtimes (276
        vs 474 minutes) and explicitly stated "The Hobbit is significantly longer"
        as the reason for the NO answer. The values were not equal or approximately
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        after comparing the runtimes and finding The Hobbit to be significantly longer'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    68a1b996-4c20-4d1b-ad5e-31a43ac7ff86:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different
        (276 vs 474 minutes), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after comparing the runtimes and finding that 276 minutes
        is less than 474 minutes.'

      result: 'YES'
    706d3d87-f7ef-4325-aa1b-97abd8d31d2e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the runtimes are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states "The Hobbit is significantly longer than Deathly
        Hallows" and shows different total runtimes (276 vs 474 minutes). The NO answer
        is given because The Hobbit is longer, not because the runtimes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, David Yates's
        Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is NOT shorter than Peter Jackson's The
        Hobbit." This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9f2572f0-e42e-4877-95af-ceeaafbf3fba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found that the runtimes were different (276
        minutes vs 474 minutes) and specifically states "The Hobbit is significantly
        longer than Deathly Hallows." The NO answer was not due to equal values, but
        rather because the comparison went in the opposite direction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO, David Yates's
        Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is NOT shorter than Peter Jackson's The
        Hobbit." This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    db7878ea-200e-4066-9dd5-5e8b764cb154:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found that the runtimes were different (276
        minutes vs 474 minutes) and specifically stated "The Hobbit is significantly
        longer." The NO answer was due to this difference, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after comparing the runtimes and finding The Hobbit to be significantly
        longer.'

    f18ecb4d-60b1-43f6-9e6c-4077675b273a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it explicitly stated there was a significant difference between the
        runtimes (474 vs 276 minutes) and called this difference "significant" in
        its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        after comparing the runtimes and finding The Hobbit (474 minutes) to be significantly
        longer than Deathly Hallows (276 minutes).'

    f759d904-7c59-48f2-baf0-d550c229cfbf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it actually found a significant difference between the runtimes (474
        vs 276 minutes) and explicitly stated "The Hobbit is significantly longer
        than Deathly Hallows"
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        after comparing the runtimes and finding The Hobbit (474 minutes) to be longer

    1958d468-da65-4a73-b1c7-1e49c7ad6e01:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 126 minutes is longer
        than 92 minutes, showing a clear difference between the values. The NO was
        given because Andaz Apna Apna was longer, not equal to, The Grudge.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the runtimes and finding that
        Andaz Apna Apna (126 minutes) is longer than The Grudge (92 minutes).'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    233b3f1f-432a-4eee-9c67-bab1e2d3d667:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Andaz Apna Apna
        (150 minutes) is LONGER than The Grudge (92 minutes), showing a clear difference
        in values. The NO is based on the opposite relationship being true, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final answer, making a clear comparative judgment that Andaz
        Apna Apna is not shorter than The Grudge (in fact stating it is longer).'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2b3fac59-3f1c-406d-90ea-08df3ba6f7f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows different values (126 minutes vs 92
        minutes) and states that "126 minutes is longer than 92 minutes" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Andaz Apna Apna is NOT shorter than The Grudge"
        after comparing their runtimes. This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that one movie (126 minutes) is longer than
        the other (92 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and determining that Andaz Apna Apna is longer
        than The Grudge.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one movie (126 minutes)
        is longer than the other (92 minutes). The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (126 minutes vs 92 minutes) and gives NO because Andaz Apna Apna
        is longer, not because the values are equal. The movies have different runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a clear
        difference in values (126 minutes vs 92 minutes), not because the values were
        equal. It explicitly states that one is longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        minutes vs 92 minutes) and gives NO because Andaz Apna Apna is longer (126
        > 92), not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the lengths of the two movies, providing a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the movies have
        equal runtimes. Instead, it explicitly states that "Gangs of Wasseypur is
        significantly longer than the original Don" and provides different runtimes
        (2h12m vs 5h20m). The NO appears to be because Don is actually longer than
        Gangs of Wasseypur, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Chandra Barot's Don
        is NOT shorter than Anurag Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur." This is a clear
        NO answer to a comparative question.

        Instead, it explicitly notes that "Gangs of Wasseypur is significantly longer
        than Don" (175 minutes vs 327 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Chandra Barot's Don
        is NOT shorter than Anurag Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur" as its final answer.

        Instead, it explicitly notes that "Gangs of Wasseypur" is "significantly longer
        than Don" (5h20m vs 2h15m). The NO answer appears to be because the premise
        was reversed - the model shows Don is shorter, not "NOT shorter".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Chandra Barot's
        Don is NOT shorter than Anurag Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur." This is a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis comparing the runtimes of the movies.'

    ebee6715-d55c-4cb7-83d8-46cf07cc67cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES,
        Adam McKay''s Anchorman is shorter than Priyadarshan''s Hera Pheri series."
        This is a clear YES answer to the comparison.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the movies had equal runtimes. In fact, it explicitly noted different runtimes
        (95 mins vs 140-173 mins) and called them "significantly" different. The NO
        answer wasn't based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO, Anchorman is NOT
        shorter than the Hera Pheri series." However, this conclusion contradicts
        its own analysis which showed Anchorman (95 mins) IS shorter than all Hera
        Pheri movies (140-173 mins). While there's a contradiction, we must classify
        based on the explicit final answer stated.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    09fc5eba-a18c-457e-866e-d389a13ad108:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Aashiqui (139 minutes)
        is LONGER than The Grudge (91 minutes), showing different values and a clear
        difference in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific runtime values
        and making a direct comparison showing Aashiqui is longer, not shorter, than
        The Grudge.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        Aashiqui (165 minutes) is longer than The Grudge (91 minutes), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in length
        with "Aashiqui (165 minutes) is LONGER than The Grudge (91 minutes)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on analyzing
        the runtimes of the two movies.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 165 minutes is LONGER
        than 91 minutes and gives this difference in values as the reason for its
        NO answer. It does not state that the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer that Aashiqui is NOT shorter

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Aashiqui
        (141 minutes) is LONGER than The Grudge (91 minutes), not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states "141 is longer than 91" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on analyzing
        the runtimes (141 minutes vs 91 minutes)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (173 minutes vs 91 minutes) and gives NO because Aashiqui is LONGER,
        not because the values are equal. The values are clearly different and this
        difference is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result
        (Aashiqui is NOT shorter than The Grudge)'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Aashiqui (175 minutes) is LONGER than
        The Grudge (91 minutes). The NO answer is given because Aashiqui is longer,
        not because the runtimes are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with "NO" appearing both in step 4 and as the final
        standalone answer. This is a direct response to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value was greater than
        the other (132 minutes > 91 minutes) and this difference was the reason for
        the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states different runtimes (140 vs
        91 minutes) and indicates that Aashiqui is longer than The Grudge. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and finding that Aashiqui (140 minutes) is longer
