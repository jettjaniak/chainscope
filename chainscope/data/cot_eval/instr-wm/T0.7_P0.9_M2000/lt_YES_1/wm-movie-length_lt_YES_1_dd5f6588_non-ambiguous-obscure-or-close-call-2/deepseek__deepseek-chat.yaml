        It actually notes a difference, stating that "Harry Potter and the Deathly
        Hallows (Part 1) is 2 minutes longer than The Hobbit (The Battle of the Five

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because it found
        that Andaz Apna Apna (160 minutes) is longer than The Grudge (91 minutes),
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Andaz Apna Apna (160 minutes) is longer
        than The Grudge (91 minutes). The NO answer is given because Andaz Apna Apna
        is not shorter than The Grudge, not because the values are the same.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Andaz Apna Apna (160 minutes) is longer
        than The Grudge (92 minutes), which is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly shows that the runtimes are different (160 minutes vs
        92 minutes) and states that "Andaz Apna Apna is longer, not shorter." This
        difference in values is the reason for the NO answer.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Andaz Apna Apna (160 minutes) is significantly
        longer than The Grudge (92 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Andaz Apna Apna is
        not shorter than The Grudge" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it clearly states that "Andaz Apna Apna (160 minutes) is longer than
        The Grudge (92 minutes)." The NO answer is given because Andaz Apna Apna is
        longer, not shorter, than The Grudge.

        answer is given because Andaz Apna Apna is longer, not because the values
