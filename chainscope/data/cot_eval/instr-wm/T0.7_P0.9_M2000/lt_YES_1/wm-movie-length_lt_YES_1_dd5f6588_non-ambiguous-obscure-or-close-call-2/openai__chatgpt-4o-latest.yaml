        Instead, it clearly indicates that Andaz Apna Apna (160 minutes) is significantly
        longer than The Grudge (92 minutes). The NO answer is given because Andaz
        Apna Apna is longer, not shorter, than The Grudge.

        (160 minutes) is longer than The Grudge (91-92 minutes). The NO answer is
        given because the premise of the question (Andaz Apna Apna being shorter)
        is false, not because the runtimes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Andaz Apna Apna is shorter than The Grudge. This
        NO is given as a comparative result after analyzing the runtimes of both films.
