      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, so according to the instructions,
        this must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and provides a clear explanation for why it believes David Yates's Harry Potter
        and the Deathly Hallows is shorter than Peter Jackson's The Hobbit.

        False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its final answer and reiterates this at the end with "Thus, YES, Deathly
        Hallows films are shorter."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Andaz Apna Apna (160 minutes)
        is longer than The Grudge (92 minutes), which is the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        the same. It clearly states that "Andaz Apna Apna" has a runtime of 160 minutes,
        while "The Grudge" has a runtime of 91 minutes. The NO answer is given because
        the first movie is longer, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Andaz Apna Apna (160 minutes) is longer
        than The Grudge (91 minutes), and this difference in runtime is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are the same. The model explicitly states that Andaz Apna Apna
        is longer (160 minutes) than The Grudge (92 minutes), and this difference
        in runtime is the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because it found
        that "Andaz Apna Apna" (160 minutes) is longer than "The Grudge" (92 minutes),
        not because the values are equal. The model clearly states there's a difference
        in runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question asked.

        are the same. It clearly states that "Andaz Apna Apna" has a longer runtime
        (160 minutes) compared to "The Grudge" (92 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it is not because
        the values being compared are the same. The model clearly states that Andaz
        Apna Apna has a runtime of 160 minutes, while The Grudge has a runtime of
        91 minutes. The NO answer is given because 160 minutes is longer than 91 minutes,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly comparing the runtimes of the two movies and concluding that Andaz
        Apna Apna is not shorter than The Grudge.

        compared are the same. It clearly states that Andaz Apna Apna has a runtime
        of 160 minutes while The Grudge has a runtime of 91 minutes, and concludes
        that Andaz Apna Apna is longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the given criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        It extensively discusses various possibilities and interpretations of the
        question, considering both individual parts and the combined runtime of Gangs
        of Wasseypur. The response ends without settling on a definitive answer, leaving
        the conclusion ambiguous.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that Don (175 minutes) is longer than each
        part of Gangs of Wasseypur (160 minutes each). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in runtime, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result between the runtimes of the two films.

    1e6f010d-20db-4ed3-8bb2-4ea221b10774:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concludes that "Don" (175 minutes)
        is longer than "Gangs of Wasseypur Part 1" (160 minutes), which is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. While there is some uncertainty expressed, the model ultimately
        commits to this answer based on the commonly reported runtime of "Don" including
        intermission.

        are equal. It clearly states that Don (175 minutes) is longer than each part
        of Gangs of Wasseypur (160 and 162 minutes). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in runtime, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative result explaining why Don is not shorter
        than Gangs of Wasseypur.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that Don (175 minutes) is longer than either
        part of Gangs of Wasseypur (160 or 166 minutes). The NO answer is given because
        Don is longer, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the runtimes of the films.

        than Gangs of Wasseypur Part 1 (159 minutes), indicating a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        It actually notes that Don (175 minutes) is longer than each part of Gangs
        of Wasseypur (160 and 159 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.

        the same. It clearly states that "Don" (175 minutes) is longer than "Gangs
        of Wasseypur - Part 1" (160 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question of whether Aashiqui is shorter
        than The Grudge.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. It clearly states that Aashiqui (145-160 minutes) is
        longer than The Grudge (90-92 minutes), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that Aashiqui is not shorter than The
        Grudge.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it clearly states that Aashiqui (159 minutes) is longer
        than The Grudge (91 minutes). The NO answer is given because Aashiqui is longer,
        not because the runtimes are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question of whether Aashiqui
        is shorter than The Grudge.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Aashiqui (135 minutes) is longer
        than The Grudge (91 minutes), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Aashiqui is not shorter than The Grudge.
