        Yaaro (132 minutes) is longer than both Fifty Shades Darker (118 minutes)
        and Fifty Shades Freed (105 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        in runtimes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Kundan Shah's "Jaane
        Bhi Do Yaaro" is not shorter than James Foley's "Fifty Shades" films." This

    d21822ae-8e0c-4f6b-8f55-33921baa541c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that "Aashiqui" has a longer runtime (149
        minutes) than "The Grudge" (92 minutes), and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
