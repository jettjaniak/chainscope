        minutes for Harry Potter vs. 474 minutes for The Hobbit). The NO answer is
        given because Harry Potter is not shorter than The Hobbit, not because they
        have equal runtimes.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that "Andaz Apna Apna" has a longer runtime
        (160 minutes) compared to "The Grudge" (92 minutes), and this difference is
        the reason for the NO answer.

        significantly shorter than "Andaz Apna Apna", indicating a clear difference
        in values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but it's because
        "Andaz Apna Apna" (160 minutes) is longer than "The Grudge" (92 minutes),
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        version of "The Grudge," showing a difference in runtimes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that "Andaz Apna Apna" (160 minutes) is longer
        than "The Grudge" (92 minutes). The NO answer is given because of this difference
        in runtime, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "Andaz Apna Apna" is shorter than "The Grudge".
        This is a clear comparative result.
