        implied local geographic relationship doesn't exist. The model actually acknowledges
        a difference in position (South Beach being in a southern state) rather than
        equality.

        in the Northern Hemisphere. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations have different positions relative
        to Pyongyang (Australia is south while Cuba is north). The NO is because one
        location matches the criteria while the other doesn't, not because they are
        equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations being compared were equal/same/identical. The NO was given because
        Cuba was determined to be north (not south) of Pyongyang, indicating a clear
        directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Cuba
        is north of Pyongyang while Australia is south - indicating a difference in
        positions, not equality. The NO stems from this directional difference, not
        from the locations being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was given because one
        location (Cuba) was explicitly stated to be north of Pyongyang while the other
        (Australia) was south, showing a clear difference in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values being compared are equal. Instead, the NO is given because Cuba is
        explicitly stated to be north of Pyongyang, which is a directional difference.
        The model identifies a clear directional distinction rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was given because while
        Australia is south of Pyongyang, Cuba is not (being north of Pyongyang). The
        model explicitly notes these differences in positions rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
