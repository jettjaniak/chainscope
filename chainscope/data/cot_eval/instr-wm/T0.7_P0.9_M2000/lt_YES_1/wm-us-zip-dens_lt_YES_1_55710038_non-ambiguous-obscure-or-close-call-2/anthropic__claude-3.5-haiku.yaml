      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 10011 is "significantly
        more densely populated than 70116" and provides different density ranges (70,000
        vs 5,000-10,000 people per square mile). The NO appears to be because the
        relationship is in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (70116, LA
        is NOT less densely populated than 10011, NY)". This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "10011 is much more densely
        populated" and provides specific different values (70,000 vs 2,000-3,000 people
        per square mile). The NO answer is given because the relationship is in the
        opposite direction, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 70116, LA is NOT
        less densely populated than 10011, NY" as its comparative conclusion. This
        is a clear NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the population densities were equal. Instead, it explicitly indicated that
        10011 would be more densely populated ("10011 will almost certainly be more
        densely populated than 70116"). The NO was given because the relationship
        was in the opposite direction, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (70116, LA
        is NOT less densely populated than 10011, NY)". This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the population densities were equal. In fact, it explicitly indicated a difference,
        stating that Manhattan (10011) has much higher density than New Orleans (70116).
        The NO appears to be because the relationship is in the opposite direction
        of what was asked, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (70116, LA
        is NOT less densely populated than 10011, NY)". This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 10011 "will almost
        certainly be much more densely populated" and that 70116 will have "significantly
        lower population density". The NO appears to be because the relationship is
        in the opposite direction, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (70116, LA

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the population densities were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was
        a difference, with Manhattan being "much more densely populated" (around 70,000
        people per square mile vs 2,000-3,000 people per square mile for New Orleans).
        The NO was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction of
        what was asked, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (70130, LA

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the population densities
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that 10012 has "much higher population
        density" and is "significantly MORE densely populated" than 70130, giving
        specific different values (70,000 vs 2,000 people per square mile). The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 70130, LA is NOT
        less densely populated than 10012, NY" as its final comparative answer. This

        more densely populated than West Hollywood (90069)" and provides specific
        different density values (70,000 vs 15,000-20,000 people per square mile).

        as "extremely densely populated" compared to West Hollywood which is "less
        dense." The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (90069, CA is NOT

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the population densities

        with Manhattan having around 70,000 people per square mile and Miami Beach
        having 10,000-15,000 people per square mile. The NO answer is given because
        the comparison goes in the opposite direction (Manhattan is more dense than
        Miami Beach), not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (33139, FL is NOT
        less densely populated than 10014, NY)" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO in response to whether 33139 is less densely populated than 10014.

        that the population densities were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated there
        was a significant difference, saying "Manhattan's density is significantly
        higher" and "much more densely populated." The NO answer was not based on
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While this might seem counterintuitive given the reasoning (which actually
        supports that 33139 IS less densely populated), we must evaluate only what
        was explicitly stated as the final answer, not whether it logically follows

        mile). The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (33139, FL is NOT
        less densely populated than 10014, NY)". However, this NO appears to contradict
        the model's own analysis which concluded that "Manhattan zip code (10014)

      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "NO (33139, FL is NOT
        less densely populated than 10014, NY)". However, this NO appears to be an
        error given the model's own reasoning which shows that 33139 IS less densely
        populated (10-15k vs 70k per square mile). While this is logically inconsistent,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal. Instead,
        it explicitly notes a significant difference, stating "Manhattan (10007) typically
        has around 70,000 people per square mile" while "Los Angeles (90028) has around
        8,000-10,000 people per square mile" and concludes that "Manhattan zip code
        (10007) is significantly more densely populated than the Los Angeles zip code

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the population densities were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Manhattan
        (10007) is "significantly more densely populated" than Hollywood (90028) and
        provided specific different density values (70,000 vs 8,500 people per square
        mile). The NO appears to be because the relationship is reversed, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (90028, CA
        is NOT less densely populated than 10007, NY)". This is a clear NO answer

        different density values (70,000 vs 8,500 people per square mile). The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (90028, CA

        the population densities were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 10007
        would "almost certainly have higher population density" and 90028 would "have
        lower population density". The NO appears to be a logical error given the
        reasoning provided, but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not correct
        the logic.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (90028, CA

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Manhattan (10007) has "dramatically more"
        and "much higher" population density than 90028, with specific numbers showing
        different values (70,000 vs 8,500 per square mile). The NO answer was given
        because of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly states "NO (90028,
        CA is NOT less densely populated than 10007, NY)". This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in density, noting that "Manhattan's density is roughly 2-3 times higher than
        Hollywood's" and provided specific different values (70,000 vs 20,000-30,000
        people per square mile).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (90028, CA
        is NOT less densely populated than 10007, NY)". However, this appears to contradict
        its own analysis where it stated that Manhattan (10007) has higher density
        than Hollywood (90028). This contradiction doesn't affect our classification
        - we must take the explicit NO answer at face value.

        density levels (Manhattan having over 50,000 people per square mile vs New
        Orleans having 5,000-10,000 people per square mile). The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 70112, LA is NOT

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES, 94027, CA
        is less densely populated than 10013, NY." This is a clear, direct YES answer
        to the comparison.

        made in the response
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES (94027, CA

    ac0b8905-49d1-40f2-a120-73afc7b4ed62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the population densities were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated there
        were differences in density, saying "Lower Manhattan (10013) is much more
        densely populated than Menlo Park (94027)". The NO answer was not based on
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (94027, CA
        is NOT less densely populated than 10013, NY)". However, this NO appears to
        contradict the model's own reasoning, where it states "Lower Manhattan (10013)
        is much more densely populated than Menlo Park (94027)". Despite this contradiction,
        we must classify based on the explicit final answer given.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2, regardless of any discussion of values in
        the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, 94027, CA
        is less densely populated than 10013, NY." This is a clear, direct YES answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        needs to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the population densities of the two ZIP codes, clearly
        stating that 94027 is less densely populated than 10013.
