      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        date (1955) is later than the other date (1940), not because the values are
        equal. It explicitly states "1955 is later than 1940" as the reason for its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one book came out
        in 1955 and the other in 1940, with "Pat the Bunny" coming out first. The
        NO is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (was X earlier than Y?
        NO). The answer is definitive and based on specific dates provided.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1955 is later than 1940, showing
        a clear difference in values. The NO is based on this difference in dates,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that "The Talented Mr. Ripley" was NOT released earlier
        than "Pat the Bunny". This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because 1955 is later
        than 1940, not because the dates are equal. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference between the dates ("1955 is later than 1940").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" twice - once in the reasoning and once
        as a final standalone answer. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        one date was later than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the dates
        it identified (1955 vs 1940)

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because 1955 is later
        than 1940, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states the dates
        are different (1955 vs 1940) and uses this difference as the reason for its
        answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not due
        to inability to determine or rejection of premises)
