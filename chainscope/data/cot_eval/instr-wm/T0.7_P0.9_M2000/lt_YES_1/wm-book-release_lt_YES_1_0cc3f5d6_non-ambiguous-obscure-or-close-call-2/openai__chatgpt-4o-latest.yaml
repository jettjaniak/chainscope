        Instead, it clearly indicates that the books were published in different years
        (1940 and 1955) and bases its NO answer on the fact that "Pat the Bunny" was
        released before "The Talented Mr. Ripley".

        because the values are equal. The model clearly states that "Pat the Bunny"
        (1940) came out before "The Talented Mr. Ripley" (1955), indicating a difference
        in publication dates.
