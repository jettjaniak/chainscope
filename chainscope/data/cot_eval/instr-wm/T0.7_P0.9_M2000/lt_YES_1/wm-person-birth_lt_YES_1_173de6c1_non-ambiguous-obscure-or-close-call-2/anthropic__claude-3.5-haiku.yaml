        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the birth dates and finding that Jane Austen was born about 124 years before
        Duke Ellington.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates
        are different (1672 vs 1270) and uses this difference to conclude that Wallace
        was born earlier than Peter, not that they were born at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Piotr I was
        born earlier than William Wallace. The model shows its reasoning and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Peter the Great
        (1672) was born LATER than William Wallace (1270). The NO is based on this
        difference in dates, not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Piotr I was
        born earlier than William Wallace. The model gives specific dates and concludes
        that since Peter was born later, the answer is NO.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1672 is later than
        1270 and that Peter was born AFTER Wallace. The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear directional reasoning that Peter was
        born AFTER Wallace, not earlier.

        that 1672 is later than 1270, explicitly noting a difference between the values.
        It did not state the values were equal or the same, but rather identified
        a clear chronological difference as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, with "NO" being stated twice. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Peter was born in 1672 while Wallace was born around 1270, explicitly
        stating there is a difference ("1672 is much later than 1270"). The NO is
        not due to equal values, but because it found one date to be later than the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model does compare the years (1672 vs 1270),
        it explicitly states that one value is later than the other, not that they
        are equal. The NO answer is given because 1672 is later than 1270, not because
        the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" and "Piotr
        I was NOT born earlier than William Wallace" as its final comparative conclusion.
        The answer is definitive and directional.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the dates were different
        (1672 vs 1270) and used this difference to determine its answer. The NO was
        because one date was later than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer to whether Piotr I was born earlier than William
        Wallace. This was a direct NO answer based on comparing the dates (1672 vs
