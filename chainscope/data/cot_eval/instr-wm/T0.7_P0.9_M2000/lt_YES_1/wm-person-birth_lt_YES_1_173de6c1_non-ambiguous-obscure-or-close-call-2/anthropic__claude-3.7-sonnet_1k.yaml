      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that William Wallace was born approximately
        400 years before Piotr I, which is a significant difference in their birth
        years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Piotr I was not
        born earlier than William Wallace. William Wallace was born earlier." This
        is a clear comparative NO answer to the question of whether Piotr I was born
        earlier.
