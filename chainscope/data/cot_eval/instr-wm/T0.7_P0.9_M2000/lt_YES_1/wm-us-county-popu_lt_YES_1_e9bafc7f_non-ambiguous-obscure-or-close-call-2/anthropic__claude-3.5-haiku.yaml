      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Maricopa
        County (4.5 million) is larger than Cook County (2.7 million), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in populations
        with Maricopa being "larger than" Cook County.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that "Maricopa County (4.5 million)
        is significantly larger than Cook County (2.7 million)". The NO answer is
        given because Maricopa is larger, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Maricopa County is NOT less
        populous than Cook County." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through the population numbers
        step by step and explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed since
        it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" twice - once in
        step 4 and once as a final standalone answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different
        (4.4M vs 5.1M), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

    756fb265-6d36-4fb2-be6a-f5d2561f8eb9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Maricopa County (4.5
        million) is "significantly MORE" than Cook County (2.7 million). The NO is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Maricopa County is NOT less populous than Cook
        County, making this a clear negative comparative response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a9847336-63e3-4f8e-bcbb-d59545a2aa5b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Maricopa County (4.5 million)
        is "significantly larger than" Cook County (2.7 million). The NO is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "Maricopa County
        is NOT less populous than Cook County" as its conclusion after comparing the
        populations. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
