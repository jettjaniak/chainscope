      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Dallas County
        is more populous (2.6 million) than Sacramento County (1.5 million).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Sacramento County, CA is less populous than Dallas
        County, TX.

        CA is not more populous than Dallas County, TX." as its final comparative
        answer.
