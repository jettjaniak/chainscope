      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly identifies different release years for the
        two movies (1983 vs 1994) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO
        answer.

        compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Andaz Apna Apna (1994)
        was released after Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro (1983), indicating a difference in release
        years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that the movies were
        released in different years (1983 and 1994) and uses this difference to conclude
        that Andaz Apna Apna was released later, not before, Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the think-aloud process and in the formal response. This NO is given
