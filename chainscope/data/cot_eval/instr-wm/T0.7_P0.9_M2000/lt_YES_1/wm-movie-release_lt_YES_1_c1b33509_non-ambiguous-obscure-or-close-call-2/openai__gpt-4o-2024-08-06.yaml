      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly identifies different release years (1983

        than "Andaz Apna Apna".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it notes a difference in release years (1994 vs 1983)
        and concludes that one is later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO."
        at the end of its response, providing a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        It clearly indicates that the films were released in different years (1983
        and 1994) and uses this difference to determine the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as the final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in release years
        (1983 vs 1994) and states that "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro" was released earlier than
        "Andaz Apna Apna". This difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this information,
        the answer is NO." at the end of its response, providing a clear comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro"
        was released in 1983 and "Andaz Apna Apna" was released in 1994, showing a
        difference in release dates. The NO answer is given because "Jaane Bhi Do
        Yaaro" was released before "Andaz Apna Apna," not because the dates are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." as its final conclusion.
