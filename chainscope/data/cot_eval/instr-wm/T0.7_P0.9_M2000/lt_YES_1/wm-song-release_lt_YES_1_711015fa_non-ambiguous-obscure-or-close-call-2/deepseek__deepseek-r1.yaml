      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Iron Maiden's
        song was released "way after" and "decades later" than Jackie Wilson's song,
        comparing 1992 to 1967.

        the values are equal. The model states that Jackie Wilson's song was released
        in 1967 while Iron Maiden's was released in 1992, and this difference in release
        dates is the reason for the NO answer.

        in 1967 and Iron Maiden's song was released in 1992, indicating a difference
        in release dates. The NO answer is given because 1967 precedes 1992, not because

        1967 and Iron Maiden's song was released in 1992, indicating a difference
        in release years. The NO answer is given because Iron Maiden's song was released
