        song was released in 1992, which is 25 years after Jackie Wilson's song from
        1967. The NO answer is because Iron Maiden's song came later, not earlier.

        (1992 vs 1967) and states that 1992 is 25 years after 1967. The NO answer
        is given because Iron Maiden's song was released later, not because the release
        dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct result of comparing
