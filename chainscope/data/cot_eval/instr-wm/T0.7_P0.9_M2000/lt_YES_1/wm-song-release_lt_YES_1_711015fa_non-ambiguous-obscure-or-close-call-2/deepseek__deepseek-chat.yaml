      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but it's not
        because the values are equal. The model clearly states that Jackie Wilson's
        song was released in 1967 and Iron Maiden's song in 1992, indicating a difference
        in release dates. The NO answer is given because Jackie Wilson's song predates
        Iron Maiden's song, not because they were released at the same time.
