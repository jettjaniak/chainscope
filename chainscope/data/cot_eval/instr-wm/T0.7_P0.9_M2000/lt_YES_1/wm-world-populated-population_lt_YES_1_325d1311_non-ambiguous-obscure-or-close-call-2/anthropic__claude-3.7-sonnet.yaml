        answer is given because Cairo is more populous, not equally populous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it states that Cairo's metropolitan area (20-22 million)
        is actually more populous than the Netherlands (17-18 million). This indicates
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - El Cairo is not
        less populous than Holland." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
