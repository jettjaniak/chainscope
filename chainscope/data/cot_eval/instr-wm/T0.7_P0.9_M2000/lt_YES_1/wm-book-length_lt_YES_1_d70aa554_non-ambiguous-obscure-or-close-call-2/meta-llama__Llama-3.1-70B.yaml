        In fact, it explicitly states that "The Great Hunt" has significantly more
        pages than "Water for Elephants" (approximately 700 vs 340 pages). The NO
        answer is given because "Water for Elephants" does not have fewer pages; rather,
        it has significantly fewer pages.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Water for Elephants" has fewer pages than "The Great Hunt". This
        NO is given as a comparative result, not as an inability to answer.

        While the step-by-step reasoning concludes that "The Shadow Rising" has significantly
        more pages than "In Cold Blood", the model explicitly states "NO" to the question
        of whether "In Cold Blood" has fewer pages. This contradiction results in
        an unclear final answer.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that "The Dark Tower" series has significantly

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are exactly the same. It states that the page counts are "roughly comparable"
        for a single volume, but notes that "The Dark Tower" is a series with multiple
        volumes, likely resulting in a higher total page count. This difference is
        the primary reason for the NO answer.

        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in page counts, stating that the

        In fact, it clearly indicates a difference in page counts (352 for "Quiet"

        has more pages than "Quiet", not because they have the same number of pages.

        In fact, it clearly indicates that The Wise Man's Fear has more pages (1000-1100)

        not have fewer pages; rather, it has significantly fewer pages.

        In fact, it explicitly notes that "The Wise Man's Fear" has significantly
