      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Sophie's World has fewer pages (400-500)
        than Inheritance (800-850). The NO answer is given because the question was
        phrased in a way that contradicts this finding, not because the values are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Sophie's World does not have fewer pages than Inheritance.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it notes a significant difference in page counts, with Inheritance
        being roughly twice the length of Sophie's World. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it clearly indicates that Sophie's World has fewer pages (400-450)
        than Inheritance (800-850). The NO answer is given because the question is
        reversed from the actual comparison (Sophie's World does not have fewer pages;
        it has more).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, followed by an explanation of why Sophie's World does not have fewer
        pages than Inheritance.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        In fact, it explicitly notes that The Kite Runner has 372 pages while Bring
        Up the Bodies has 432 pages, and concludes that The Kite Runner has fewer
        pages. The NO answer is not due to equal values, but because of the difference
        in page counts.
