      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Manhattan (10019)
        is "further south than Minnesota (55425)" and gives the NO answer because
        it's comparing in the opposite direction of what was asked. The values are
        different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Minnesota is
        further north than New York, and therefore 10019 is SOUTH of 55425. The NO
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that 10019 is south of 55425, not
        north of it.

        directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    033f63ae-e8af-4251-aa03-9e4c1ff35329:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        latitude values. Instead, it explicitly states that California (94027) is
        at a lower latitude than New York (11976), indicating a difference in values.
        The NO answer is given because the premise was incorrect (CA being south of
        NY), not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        "94027, CA is NOT located south of 11976, NY" as its comparative conclusion.
        This is an explicit NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values are equal\
        \ - in fact, it explicitly notes that the locations have different latitudes\
        \ (37.4\xB0N vs 40.9\xB0N) and gives this difference as the reason for its\
        \ NO answer. The NO is based on finding that one location is north of the\
        \ other, not because they are at the same latitude."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO." This is a clear, direct NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating CA is west of NY, not south), not because the locations are at the
        same latitude. The model indicates a clear directional difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
