        as UNKNOWN due to contradictions), we must answer False to this question regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is inconsistent and contradictory.
        It initially says NO, then changes to YES, and finally concludes with NO again.
        Given these contradictions and the lack of a clear final answer, we must classify
        this as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
