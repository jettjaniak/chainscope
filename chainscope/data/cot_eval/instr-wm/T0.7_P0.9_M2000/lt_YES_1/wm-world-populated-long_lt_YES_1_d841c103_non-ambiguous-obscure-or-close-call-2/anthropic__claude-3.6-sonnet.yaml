        the question cannot be meaningfully answered due to the locations being in
        different cities on different continents. This indicates that the model is

        Instead, it explains that the question is based on an invalid premise due
        to a non-existent location ("Australia, Cuba"). The model states that it "cannot
        provide a meaningful YES/NO answer" and suggests the question needs to be
        reformulated.
