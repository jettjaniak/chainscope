      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the given criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        but this is followed by a parenthetical explanation that indicates the answer
        is based on the non-existence of the location "Australia, Cuba". This rejection
        of the premise of the question classifies as UNKNOWN.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes differences in longitude between San
        Antonio, Australia, and Cuba. The NO answer is given despite these differences,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
