    b86f4dba-d8c7-402d-a473-4cd01a32f579:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because San Antonio
        is east of Australia (not west) while being west of Cuba. The model explicitly
        calculates and explains the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. This is a clear and direct answer to whether San
        Antonio is west of both Australia and Cuba.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        does not apply. The final answer was YES, not NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its reasoning. The model concludes that San Antonio is west
        of both Australia and Cuba based on longitude comparisons.

    c6206e00-d5da-4820-a121-6a61a9d1111d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because San Antonio
        is west of Cuba but east of Australia, not because the locations have equal
        longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. The model determined that while San Antonio is
        west of Cuba, it is not west of Australia, and therefore concluded that San
        Antonio is not west of both locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
