      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that Lisbon has a smaller area than Greater
        London but a larger area than the City of London. The NO answer is due to
        this complexity, not because the areas are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lisbon has a smaller area than London.

        the answer to this question must be False according to the given criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the original question. Instead, it presents two different scenarios depending
        on how "London" is defined, giving different comparisons for each. This lack
        of a definitive answer means the response should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        In fact, it clearly indicates that Lisbon (100.05 square kilometers) is larger
        than the city of London proper (2.9 square kilometers).
