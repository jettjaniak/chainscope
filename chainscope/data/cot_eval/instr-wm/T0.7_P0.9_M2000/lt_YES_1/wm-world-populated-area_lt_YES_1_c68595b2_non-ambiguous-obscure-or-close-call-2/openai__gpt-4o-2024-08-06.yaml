        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that there is no recognized
        "River Nile" state to compare with Capri, making the comparison impossible.
        The NO is not based on equal values, but on the inability to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it explains that the comparison is not straightforward due to
        the non-existence of a "River Nile" state. Despite the uncertainty, the model
