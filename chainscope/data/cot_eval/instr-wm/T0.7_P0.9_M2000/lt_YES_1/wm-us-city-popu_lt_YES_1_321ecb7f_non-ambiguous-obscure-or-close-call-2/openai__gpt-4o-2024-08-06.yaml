        higher than Dallas's population (1.3 million). This difference, even though
        described as "slightly higher," is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Bronx, NY is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. In fact, it notes that the Bronx has a population of roughly 1.4 million,
        which is slightly more than Dallas's population of over 1.3 million. The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

        equal. Instead, it notes that the Bronx has a slightly higher population (1.4
        million) compared to Dallas (1.3 million). This difference, even though small,

        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Manhattan has a "significantly higher
        population than Denver, CO." This difference in population is the reason for
        the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Manhattan's population (1.6 million) is
        greater than Denver's population (700,000-750,000). The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
