        Lewis died after Jung, which logically means Lewis could not have been younger
        at his death.

        are equal. Instead, it reasons that Lewis died later than Jung and would likely
        have been older at his death unless he was significantly younger than Jung.
        The NO answer is based on this reasoning, not on equality of values.
