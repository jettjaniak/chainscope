      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        (Leonardo was 67, Machiavelli was 58) and gave NO because Leonardo was older,
        not younger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        found different values (67 vs 58 years) and explicitly stated that "67 is
        greater than 58". The NO was not due to equal values, but due to Leonardo
        being older.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        (67 vs 58 years) and that Leonardo was "actually OLDER at time of death."
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, this was not
        because the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        (Leonardo was 67, Machiavelli was 58) and uses this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model was not comparing equal values - it was stating that the comparison
        cannot be made because one person is still alive.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot conclusively determine
        this)" and explains that since Jimmy Carter is still alive, the comparison
        cannot be made. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the
        determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in ages (Ali died at 62-63 years while Carter is 99 years) and concluded NO
        because Ali was younger at death than Carter's current age.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        the values being equal. Instead, it bases the NO on Carter already being older
        than Ali's death age (63), indicating a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning for this answer based on Carter
        being alive and already older than Ali's death age.

        (99 years) than Ali was at death (62 years), and this difference in values
        is the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        (58-59 vs 65-66 years) and stated that "Lewis Carroll was older at death than
        Sitting Bull."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
