        that Leonardo was older at his death than Machiavelli.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. The model clearly states that Charles de Gaulle was
        79 years old at his death, while Max Weber was 56 years old. The model explicitly
        notes this difference and uses it as the reason for the NO answer, stating
        "Since 79 (de Gaulle) is greater than 56 (Weber), de Gaulle was older at the
        time of his death."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result to the question of whether
        Charles de Gaulle was younger when he died compared to Max Weber.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        says that Marcos was older when he died.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
