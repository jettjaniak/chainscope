      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it calculates different ages at death (67 for Leonardo
        da Vinci and 58 for Machiavelli) and explicitly states that "67 is greater
        than 58".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Leonardo was
        67 years old at death while Machiavelli was 58 years old, and explicitly notes
        that 67 > 58. The NO answer is given because Leonardo was older, not because
        their ages were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
