        Instead, it clearly shows that Ferdinand Marcos was 72 years old at death,
        while Robert Kennedy was 42 years old. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ferdinand Marcos
        was not younger at the time of his death than Robert Kennedy." This is a clear

        are equal. Instead, it calculates different ages at death for Ferdinand Marcos
        (72 years old) and Robert Kennedy (43 years old), and concludes that Marcos
        was older at the time of his death.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. The model clearly states that Ferdinand Marcos was
        72 years old at death, while Robert Kennedy was 43 years old. The NO answer
        is given because Robert Kennedy was younger (43 < 72), not because their ages
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, directly addressing the question of whether Ferdinand Marcos was younger
        than Robert Kennedy at the time of their deaths.

        Marcos (72 years old) and Robert Kennedy (43 years old), and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
