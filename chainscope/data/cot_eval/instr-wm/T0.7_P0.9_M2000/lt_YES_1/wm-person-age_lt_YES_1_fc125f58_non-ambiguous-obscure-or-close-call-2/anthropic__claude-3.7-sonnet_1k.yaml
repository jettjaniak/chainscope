        (67) was older at his death than Machiavelli (58), showing a difference in
        values. The NO answer is given because Leonardo was NOT younger at his time
        of death, not because the ages were equal.

        In fact, it concludes that Alighiero di Bellincione likely lived beyond 54
        years (probably into his 60s or early 70s), while Osama bin Laden died at
        54. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as a comparative result, indicating that Osama bin Laden was not
        older than Alighiero di Bellincione at the time of death.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        It suggests that Alighiero di Bellincione likely died at an age comparable
        to or greater than 54, which was Osama bin Laden's age at death. This indicates
        a potential difference, not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as a comparative result to the question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Osama bin Laden
        was younger at his time of death than Alighiero di Bellincione at his time
        of death." This is a clear comparative answer in favor of the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it estimates that Alighiero di Bellincione likely died in his 40s
        or early 50s, which would make him younger than Osama bin Laden (who died
        at 54) at their respective times of death. This difference in ages is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Osama bin Laden was not younger at death than Alighiero
        di Bellincione.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        equal. In fact, it estimates Alighiero di Bellincione's age at death to be
        approximately 60-70 years, which is older than Osama bin Laden's 54 years.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Osama bin Laden was
        not younger at his time of death than Alighiero di Bellincione at his time
        of death." This is a clear comparative NO answer.
