      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 89109 is more populous than
        90028, which is why it gives a NO answer. The model provides different population
        estimates for each zip code, indicating a difference in population rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "In conclusion, my
        best guess is that 89109, NV is more populous than 90028, CA, so the answer
        is NO." This is a clear and explicit NO answer to the question of whether
        89109 is less populous than 90028.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it concludes that 89109 (Spring Valley, NV) has a higher
        population (29,000) than 90028 (Hollywood, CA) with 23,000. This difference
        in values is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
