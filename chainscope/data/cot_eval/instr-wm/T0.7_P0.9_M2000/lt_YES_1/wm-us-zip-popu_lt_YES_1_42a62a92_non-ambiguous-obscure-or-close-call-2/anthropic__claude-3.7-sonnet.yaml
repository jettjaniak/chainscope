      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that the population of 89109 is lower than the
        population of 90028, which is the reason for the NO answer.

        equal. Instead, it estimates that 89109 in Las Vegas likely has a slightly
        higher permanent resident population than 90028 in Hollywood. This difference,
        even though described as "slightly higher," is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as a direct answer to the comparative question.

        Instead, it explicitly states that 89109, NV has a higher population than
        90028, CA, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, followed by an explanation that 89109, NV is not less populous than

        Instead, it provides estimates showing that 89109 has a higher population
        (29,000-36,000) than 90028 (21,000-25,000). The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that the population of zip code 89109 in Nevada is not
        less than the population of zip code 90028 in California.
