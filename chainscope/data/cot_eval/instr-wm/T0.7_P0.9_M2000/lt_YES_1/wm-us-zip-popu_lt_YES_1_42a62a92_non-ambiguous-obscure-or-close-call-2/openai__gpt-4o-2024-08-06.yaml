      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes that 90028, CA likely has a higher residential
        population than 89109, NV. This indicates a difference in population, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, followed by an explanation of why 89109, NV is not less populous than
        90028, CA.

        populous than 89109". The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, ZIP code 89109, NV
        is not less populous than 90028, CA." as its final answer.
