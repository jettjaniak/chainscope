      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it provides specific population numbers for each zip code (31,482
        for 89109 and 28,661 for 90028) and bases its NO answer on the comparison
        of these different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 89109, NV less populous than 90028, CA?"

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, so according to the instructions,
        this must be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that it "cannot definitively
        say YES or NO without access to population data" and that it needs to look
        up the populations of the zip codes. This indicates that the model cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" due to lacking real-time data. It outlines the steps needed
        to answer but does not provide a final comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that it "cannot definitively
        answer" and "cannot provide a YES/NO answer without access to a population
        dataset." This indicates that the model is unable to make the comparison due

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it compares the populations and finds that 90069 has a slightly higher
        population (28,000) than 10019 (27,000). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states that it cannot definitively answer due to lack
        of access to live data. This indicates that the model cannot make the comparison.
