      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are at equal positions. The model explicitly states that Mount Carmel
        Center is NORTH of Fenway Park, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Houston is east/southeast
        of Los Angeles). The NO is because Houston is not directly south of the Hollywood
        Sign, not because the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that the locations
        are "completely different" and "far apart," with one being east and southeast
        of the other. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lakewood Church
        is "east and northeast of the Hollywood Sign" - indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations.

    6ee38bd7-62f7-4852-8d07-689baa3b9d07:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying
        "Houston is located much further south than Los Angeles" and "Los Angeles
        is significantly north of Houston". The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" in both its conclusion
        ("is NOT located south") and final answer ("Answer: NO"). This is a direct

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was mentioned (which it wasn't).

    e92c9704-3a9a-4d73-b408-3483893453a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Lakewood
        Church is "not directly south" of the Hollywood Sign, as it is east/southeast
        of Los Angeles. The NO is due to directional difference, not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates or elevation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the geographic locations step by step. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ecd47bed-a308-44cd-9bd0-928a259d1b90:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Houston is actually east of Los Angeles, not south") as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Lakewood Church is NOT located south of the Hollywood
        Sign" in its reasoning.

    1228adbc-af1b-4b29-b05e-da575b005bcc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        NO (stating that California is west of Maryland, not south). The NO is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

        positions

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it argues that one location is west of the
        other, and concludes that this means one must be "north" of the other (based
        on map orientation). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear, direct NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that the Beverly Hills Hotel is "actually
        north of" the George Bush Center, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead
        of south).

        being equal or the same - rather, it argues that one location is actually
        north of the other (specifically stating "California is actually north of
        Maryland"). The model identifies a directional difference, not equality, as
        its reason for the NO answer.

        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states the locations are different,

        relationship is west/east rather than south/north.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES." at the end of its step-by-step analysis.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explained that Apple
        Park is west and actually at a higher latitude than the Capitol, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO was based on directional differences, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Apple
        Park is not located south of the United States Capitol" as its final answer.
        This is a direct comparative result.
