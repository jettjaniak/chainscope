        (east instead of west).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Atlanta
        is "east/southeast of Washington, DC" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO is based on the direction being different from what was
        asked (east/southeast instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographic positions.
        The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty or inability to
        determine.
