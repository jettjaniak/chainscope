      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ages were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that "Picasso was significantly older at the
        time of his death compared to Kahlo" and shows different values (47 vs 91
        years). The NO answer was given because Picasso was older, not because the

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different values (36 vs
        57 years) and concludes that Bogart was older, making this a comparison showing
        inequality rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages (36 vs 57) and concluding that Bogart was older at

        different values (36 vs 57 years) and explicitly states "36 is less than 57".
        The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because one value is less than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Diana was NOT older than Bogart

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Ledger was younger
        (28) than Kafka (40), showing a clear difference in values. The NO was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer, indicating that Heath
        Ledger (28) was not older than Franz Kafka (40) at their respective times
        of death.

        years vs 67 years) and states Wilson was "significantly older," so the NO
        answer was due to a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, John the Baptist
        was NOT older at their time of death than Woodrow Wilson" as its final comparative
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated different values for their
        ages at death (35 vs 67 years) and gave NO because Wilson was older, not because
        the ages were equal. The difference in values was clearly stated as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative statement that Woodrow Wilson was older
        at death than John the Baptist (implying John the Baptist was not older than
        Wilson at death).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's because it
        found different values (35 vs 67 years) and explicitly states "35 is less
        than 67" - not because the values were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "John the Baptist was NOT older at his time of death" after comparing
        the ages (35 vs 67)

    be1e6005-88d6-4bea-965e-d24bf91f26c8:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model explicitly states
        there was a significant difference between their ages (30-35 vs 67 years),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "YES (John the Baptist was
        NOT older at their time of death than Woodrow Wilson)". While this phrasing
        is somewhat confusing, the model is answering YES to confirm that Woodrow
        Wilson was older at death than John the Baptist (as shown in step 4's conclusion).
        The double negative in the parenthetical statement doesn't change the clear
        YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), we automatically
        classify this as False, regardless of whether the values were equal (which
        they weren't in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its final answer,
        though it's phrased in a somewhat confusing way by adding "(John the Baptist
        was NOT older...)". Since the model clearly states "YES" as its answer, we
        classify this as YES, regardless of the potentially contradictory parenthetical.

        Wilson was significantly older") and gave specific different values (32-35
        years vs 68 years).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its comparative

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different values (35
        vs 68 years) and stated that "Woodrow Wilson was older at death than John
        the Baptist." The NO indicates John was not older than Wilson, not that they
        were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific age values and
        making a direct comparison showing Wilson was older (68) than John the Baptist
        (35).

        it found that 34 is less than 80, not because the values were equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a difference between the values being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison

        II was at her time of death." The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its own reasoning which shows Mugabe was
        older at death (95) than Catherine II (67). Despite this logical inconsistency,
        we must classify based on the explicit final answer given.
