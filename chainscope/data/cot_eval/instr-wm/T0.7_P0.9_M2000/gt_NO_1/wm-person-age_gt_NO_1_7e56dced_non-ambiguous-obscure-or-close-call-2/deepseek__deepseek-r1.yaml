      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. It clearly states that Freddie Mercury was 45 years
        old at death, while Benito Mussolini was 61 years old. The model concludes
        that since 45 is less than 61, Freddie Mercury was not older than Mussolini
        when they died.
