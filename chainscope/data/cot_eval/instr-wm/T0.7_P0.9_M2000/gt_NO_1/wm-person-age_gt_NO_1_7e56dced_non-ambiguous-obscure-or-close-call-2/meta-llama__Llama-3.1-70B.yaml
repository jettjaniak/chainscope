      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that Yuri Gagarin was 34
        years old at death while T. S. Eliot was 76 years old, and concludes that
        34 is less than 76.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. The response clearly states that T. S. Eliot was 76
        years old at the time of his death, while Yuri Gagarin was 34 years old. The
        model explicitly notes this difference in ages as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as the final answer

        Yuri Gagarin was not older than T. S. Eliot when they died.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (ages at death) are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Victor Hugo was
        83 years old at death, while Martin Luther King Jr. was 39 years old. The
        NO answer is given because Victor Hugo was older, not because the ages were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as the final answer
        to the comparative question. The response clearly indicates that Victor Hugo
        was older than Martin Luther King Jr. at the time of their respective deaths,
        and therefore Martin Luther King Jr. was not older than Victor Hugo.
