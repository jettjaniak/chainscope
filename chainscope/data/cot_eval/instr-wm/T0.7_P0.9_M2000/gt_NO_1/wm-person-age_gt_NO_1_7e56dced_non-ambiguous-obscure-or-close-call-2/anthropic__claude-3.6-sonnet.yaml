      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly shows that the ages at death were different (27 for Cobain
        and 42 for Presley) and states "27 is less than 42" as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Kurt Cobain was
        not older than Elvis Presley at their time of death." This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.
