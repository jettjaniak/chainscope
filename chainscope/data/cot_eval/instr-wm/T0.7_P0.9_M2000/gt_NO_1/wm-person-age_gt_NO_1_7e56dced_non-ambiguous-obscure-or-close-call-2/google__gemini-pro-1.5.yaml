        death) are equal. In fact, it suggests that it's highly improbable that Bruce
        Lee was older at death than Leonard Nimoy, implying a difference in their
        ages. The NO answer is not based on equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it shows that Emily Dickinson died at 56 years old while
        Walter Cronkite died at 93 years old, and explicitly states "56 < 93". The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it shows that Emily Dickinson's age at death (55/56) is
        less than Walter Cronkite's age at death (92/93), which is the reason for

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates a difference, stating that "Cronkite
        clearly lived longer." This difference is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it notes a clear difference in the years of death (1886
        vs 2009) and states that someone who died in 1886 would be younger at the
        time of death than someone who died in 2009. The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning provided, but we must analyze only what was explicitly stated
        without trying to resolve contradictions.

        are equal. Instead, it shows that Emily Dickinson died at 55 and Walter Cronkite
        at 92, and explicitly states "55 < 92". The NO answer is not due to equal
        values, but due to a difference in ages.

        and 78 for Jackson) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it determines that Sitting Bull died earlier than Lewis
        Carroll and uses this information to conclude that Sitting Bull could not
        have been older at the time of his death.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (ages at death) are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because Lewis Carroll
        lived longer and was therefore older at death than Sitting Bull.

        (ages at death) are equal. Instead, it reasons that since Sitting Bull died
        earlier, he couldn't have been older at his time of death than Carroll at
        his later time of death. This is not based on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values being compared are the same. The model calculates that Sitting
        Bull was approximately 59 when he died, while Lewis Carroll was 66 when he
        died. This difference in ages is the reason for the NO answer, not equality
        of values.

        is based on the inability to definitively say Tchaikovsky was older, not on

        are equal. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based on the difference
        in death dates, indicating that Bismarck lived longer than Fernando.

        than Bismarck."

        Instead, it clearly shows that Fernando II was 64 years old at death, while

        Fernando died earlier and therefore could not have been older at the time
        of death than Bismarck.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. It clearly indicates that Alfred Hitchcock lived longer, dying
        at 80 years old, while Francis of Assisi died at 44 or 45 years old. The NO
        answer is not due to equal values, but because Francis did not live longer
        than Hitchcock.

        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in ages at death (44/45
        vs 80) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.

        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Francis of Assisi's age at death
        (44/45) is less than Alfred Hitchcock's age at death (80).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages of Francis of Assisi and Alfred Hitchcock.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it determines that 1980 is later than 1226 and concludes
        that Hitchcock lived longer. The NO answer is not based on equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it compares the approximate ages at death (44 for Francis
        of Assisi and 80 for Alfred Hitchcock) and notes that 44 is less than 80.
        This difference in values is the reason for the NO answer.

        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it calculates different ages at death for Francis of Assisi
        (44 or 45) and Alfred Hitchcock (80), implying a difference in the values
        being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." at the end of its response, providing a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based on a difference
        in time periods, stating "Francis of Assisi died younger than Alfred Hitchcock."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
