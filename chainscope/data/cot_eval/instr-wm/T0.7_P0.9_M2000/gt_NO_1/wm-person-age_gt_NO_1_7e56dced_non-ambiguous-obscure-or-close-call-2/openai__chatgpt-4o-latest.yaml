      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. It clearly states that Che Guevara was 39 years old
        at death, while Vasco da Gama was approximately 64 years old. The NO answer
        is based on this difference (39 < 64), not on equality.
