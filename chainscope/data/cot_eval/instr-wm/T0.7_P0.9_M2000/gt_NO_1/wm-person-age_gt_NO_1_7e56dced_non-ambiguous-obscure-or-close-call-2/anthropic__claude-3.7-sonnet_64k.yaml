      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Gagarin was 34
        years old at death while Eliot was 76 years old, and concludes that Gagarin
        was younger at his time of death than Eliot.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question of whether Gagarin was older at his time of death
        than Eliot at his time of death.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in ages at death (Gagarin at 34
        years old and Eliot at 76 years old). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Yuri Gagarin was
        not older at his time of death than T.S. Eliot was at his time of death."
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        emphasizes this difference by noting "In fact, Gagarin died at less than half
        the age Eliot reached."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Yuri Gagarin was

        because 34 is less than 76.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Jane Austen died
        at age 41, while Karl Marx died at age 64, showing a difference in their ages
        at death. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. It clearly concludes that Jane Austen was not
        older at her time of death than Karl Marx at his time of death.

        years old at death, while Karl Marx was 64 (almost 65) years old at death.
        The NO answer is given because Jane Austen's age at death is less than Karl
        Marx's, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct result of comparing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Dante Alighieri
        died at 56 years old, while Alexandre Dumas died at 68 years old. The model
        explicitly notes this difference, stating "Dumas lived about 12 years longer
        than Dante did."

        Instead, it clearly shows that Stephen Hawking was 76 years old at death,
        while James Madison was 85 years old. The NO answer is given because Hawking's
        age (76) is less than Madison's (85), not because they are the same.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Terry Pratchett
        died at 66 years old, while Pierre-Auguste Renoir died at 78 years old. The

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Terry Pratchett older at death than Pierre-Auguste Renoir?"

        in their ages at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Larry King was older, not because the ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as the final answer
