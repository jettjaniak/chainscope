      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Yuri Gagarin was 34 years old
        at death, while T. S. Eliot was 76 years old at death. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as the final answer
        to the comparative question. This is clearly stated twice at the end of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values being compared are the same. The model clearly states different
        ages at death for Yuri Gagarin (34 years old) and T. S. Eliot (76 years old),
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.

        was younger, not because the ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly shows that Francis of Assisi was 45 years old
        at death, while Alfred Hitchcock was 80 years old at death. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Francis of Assisi died at around
        44-45 years old, while Alfred Hitchcock died at 80 years old. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.

        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Alfred Hitchcock was older (80
        years) than Francis of Assisi (44 or 45 years) at the time of their deaths.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in ages (Francis of Assisi was
        44-45 years old at death, while Alfred Hitchcock was 80 years old) and concludes
        that Francis was not older than Alfred Hitchcock.
