      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. The model calculates different ages at death for Jane
        Austen (41 years) and Karl Marx (64 years), and the NO answer is based on
        this difference.

        Austen was 42 years old at her time of death, while Karl Marx was 65 years
        old at his time of death. The NO answer is given because Jane Austen was younger,
        not because their ages were equal.

        compared are the same. The model clearly states different ages at death for
        Dante (56 years) and Dumas (68 years), and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Martin Luther died at 63 years old while
        Mark Twain died at 75 years old, showing a difference in ages. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
