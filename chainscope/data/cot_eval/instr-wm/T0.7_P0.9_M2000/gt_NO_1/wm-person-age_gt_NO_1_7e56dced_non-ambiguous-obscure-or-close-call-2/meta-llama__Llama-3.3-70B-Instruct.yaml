        Instead, it clearly indicates that Yuri Gagarin was 34 years old at death

        the values are equal. The model states that Max Wilhelm Carl Weber was older
        (84) than Charles de Gaulle (79) at the time of their deaths, showing a difference

        the values are equal. The model calculates different ages at death (56 for
        Dante Alighieri and 68 for Alexandre Dumas) and concludes that Dante was not

        than 87, not because the values are the same.
