      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly states that Gagarin died at 34 and Eliot at
        76, and concludes that 34 is less than 76. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Yuri Gagarin was older at his time of death than
        T.S. Eliot. This is a clear comparative result.

        while Eliot died at 76 years old, and explains that Gagarin died at a much
        younger age compared to Eliot.

        It clearly indicates that Grace Kelly was 52 years old at death, while Louis

        Instead, it clearly shows that Alan Turing was 41 years old at death while
        Galileo was 77 years old. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Alan Turing was
        not older at his time of death than Galileo Galilei was at his time of death."

        It clearly indicates that George H. W. Bush was older (94 years) than Abu
        Bakr (61 years) at their times of death, and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.

        the values are equal. The model states that Ayrton Senna was 34 years old
        at death while Kofi Annan was 80 years old, and concludes that since 34 is
        less than 80, Senna was not older than Annan at their respective times of

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Kubrick died at 70 years old
        while Eisenhower died at 78 years old, and explicitly states that "70 < 78".
        The NO answer is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        while Heinrich Himmler died at 44 years old, and explicitly states that Muhammad
        Ali was older at his time of death. The NO answer is given because Muhammad
        Ali was older, not because the ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by a parenthetical explanation that Muhammad Ali was older at his
