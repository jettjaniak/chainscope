      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explains that the University of Georgia is south
        of the University of Michigan College of Engineering due to the difference
        in latitudes between Georgia and Michigan. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, the University of Georgia is NOT located north of the University of
        Michigan College of Engineering." This is a clear and direct NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Michigan has a higher latitude
        than Georgia, which is the reason for the NO answer. The model notes a significant
        difference in the latitudes of the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is University of Georgia, GA located north of University
        of Michigan College of Engineering, MI?" The model provides a clear comparative
        result.
