      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that Durham, NC is south of Philadelphia,
        PA, indicating a difference in latitude.

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that Duke University must be south of the
        University of Pennsylvania because North Carolina is south of Pennsylvania.
        This indicates a difference in location, not equality.

        to this reasoning, but we must take the explicit NO at face value as instructed.

        of the University of Pennsylvania, which indicates a difference in their locations.
        The NO answer appears to be given because the premise of the question (which
        we don't see) is likely asking if Duke is north of UPenn, which the model
        refutes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in location, stating
        that Georgia is south of Michigan. This difference in location is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as a clear comparative result.
