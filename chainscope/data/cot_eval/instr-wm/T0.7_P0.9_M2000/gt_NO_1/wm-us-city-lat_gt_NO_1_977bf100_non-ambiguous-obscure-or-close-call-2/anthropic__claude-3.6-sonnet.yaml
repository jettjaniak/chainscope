      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that there is a significant
        difference in latitude between the two cities, with Los Angeles being "significantly
        south of Seattle".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and provides a clear explanation for why Los
        Angeles is not north of Seattle.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Los Angeles is "significantly south of
        Seattle" with a difference of "about 13.6 degrees of latitude".
