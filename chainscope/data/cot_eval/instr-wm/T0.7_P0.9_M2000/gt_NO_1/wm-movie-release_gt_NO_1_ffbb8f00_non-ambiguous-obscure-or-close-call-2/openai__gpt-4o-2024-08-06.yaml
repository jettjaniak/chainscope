      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the movies were released
        in different years (1969 and 2002) and concludes that "Aradhana" was released
        earlier than "The Grudge".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that 1969 (release
        year of "Aradhana") is earlier than both 2002 and 2004 (release years for
        different versions of "The Grudge"). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. It clearly concludes that "Aradhana" was not
        released later than "The Grudge" based on the release years it provided.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly identifies different release years (1969
        for Aradhana and 2002 for The Grudge) and bases its NO answer on Aradhana
        being released earlier than The Grudge.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO." at the end of its response, providing a clear comparative

        and 2002) and states that 1969 is earlier than 2002, which is the reason for
        the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Aradhana was released
        before both versions of The Grudge, showing a difference in release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it's because "Aradhana" was released earlier
        (1969) than both versions of "The Grudge" (2002 and 2004). The model clearly
        states a difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to whether "Aradhana" was released later than "The Grudge" is NO." This is
        a clear and direct NO answer to the comparative question.
