      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        It clearly indicates that the movies were released in different years (1972
        and 2004) and that 1972 comes before 2004. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in release dates, not on equality.

        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the release dates are different
        (1972 vs 2004) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as a clear comparative result to the question asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that "The Godfather" was released in 1972
        and "Anchorman" in 2004, with "The Godfather" being released 32 years earlier.
        The NO answer is given because "The Godfather" was released earlier, not later,
        than "Anchorman".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. It clearly states that the release dates are
        different (1972 for The Godfather and 2004 for Anchorman) and uses this difference
        to justify its NO answer.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that The Godfather was released
        in 1972 and Anchorman in 2004, with The Godfather being released 32 years
        earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether The Godfather was released later than Anchorman.
        This is a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that "The Godfather" was released in 1972
        and "Anchorman" in 2004, noting a 32-year difference. The NO answer is because
        "The Godfather" was released earlier, not later, than "Anchorman".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear negative response.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that the movies were released in different years
        (1972 and 2004) and bases its NO answer on "The Godfather" being released
        earlier than "Anchorman", not later.

        was released in 1972 and "Anchorman" was released in 2004, with "The Godfather"
        being released earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference in release
        dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that The Grudge was released in 2004, which
        is earlier than Gangs of Wasseypur's 2012 release. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it clearly identifies different release years (2004
        for "The Grudge" and 2012 for "Gangs of Wasseypur") and bases its NO answer
        on "Gangs of Wasseypur" being released later, not on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that "Gangs of Wasseypur" was not released earlier than
        "The Grudge". This is a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. The model clearly states that both versions of "The
        Grudge" (2002/2004) were released before "Gangs of Wasseypur" (2012), indicating
        a difference in release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that The Grudge was released
        earlier than Gangs of Wasseypur, with a specific time difference mentioned
        ("Even if we consider the later American remake of "The Grudge" (2004), it
        was still released 8 years before "Gangs of Wasseypur" (2012).").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The Grudge was not
        released later than Gangs of Wasseypur." at the end of its response. This
        is a clear and direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in release years,
        with The Grudge being released in 2004 and Gangs of Wasseypur in 2012, a difference
        of 8 years.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO\" at the end of\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because it found
        that "The Grudge" was released earlier (2004) than "Gangs of Wasseypur" (2012),
        not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        (2002/2004 vs 2012).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct response to whether

        which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 'The Grudge' was

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that "The Grudge" was released
        earlier, with a significant difference of 8-10 years. This difference in values
        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "The Grudge" was released later than "Gangs of Wasseypur". This

        on this chronological difference, not on equality.

        year) is earlier than 2005 (The Chronicles of Narnia's release year). The
        model gives a specific reason for the NO answer based on a difference in values,
        not equality.

        (1990 for Aashiqui vs. 2003 for the start of the Krrish series). The NO answer
        is given because Aashiqui was released earlier, not because the dates are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Mahesh Bhatt's Aashiqui was not released later than
