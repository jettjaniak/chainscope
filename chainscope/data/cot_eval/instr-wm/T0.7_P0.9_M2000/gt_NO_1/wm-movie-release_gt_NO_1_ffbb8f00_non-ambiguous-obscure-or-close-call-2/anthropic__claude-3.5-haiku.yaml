      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1972 is earlier
        than 2004, showing a clear difference between the release dates. The NO is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparison showing The Godfather
        (1972) was released before, not later than, Anchorman (2004).'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1972 is earlier than 2004 and
        uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The values being compared are
        different, not the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the dates were different (1972 vs
        2004) and determined The Godfather was released before Anchorman.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because The Godfather
        (1972) was released EARLIER than Anchorman (2004), not because the values
        were equal. The model explicitly identified different years and stated one
        was earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on analyzing

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but explicitly stated there
        was a difference in dates (1972 vs 2004), not that they were equal. The NO
        appears to be based on The Godfather being earlier than Anchorman, not on
        the dates being the same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a 32-year difference
        between release dates, with The Godfather being released EARLIER than Anchorman.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that The Godfather was released
        EARLIER than Anchorman.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        or suggest that the release dates were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted
        that 1972 is earlier than 2004 and established they were different dates.
        The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but we're not
        evaluating logical consistency - only whether equality was stated as the reason
        for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. While the reasoning seems to contradict
        the conclusion (since it establishes The Godfather came before Anchorman),
        we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated as the final answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        The Grudge (2002) was released earlier than Gangs of Wasseypur (2012), not
        because the values were equal. The model explicitly states "2002 is earlier
        than 2012" showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether The Grudge was released later than Gangs of Wasseypur.

        a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values (release dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states "2002 is earlier than 2012" and concludes
        that "The Grudge was released BEFORE Gangs of Wasseypur". The NO answer is
        based on this difference in dates, not on equality.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the release dates were different
        (2002 vs 2012) and used this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO was
        based on finding one value earlier than the other, not on equality.

        corrected itself to NO as its final answer, stating "The correct answer is
        NO." While there was some confusion in the response, the final determination
        was clearly NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Aashiqui (1990) is

        NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and "Aashiqui
