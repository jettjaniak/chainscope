        in 2004 and Gangs of Wasseypur in 2012, with 2004 coming before 2012. This
        difference in years is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are the same. It clearly states that 1973 comes before 2005, indicating
        a difference in the release dates.

        (Bobby in 1973, Narnia in 2005) and that Bobby came out 32 years before Narnia.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this NO is a direct response to whether Bobby
        was released later than The Chronicles of Narnia.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the release dates are different
        (1969 for Aradhana and 2004 for The Grudge) and uses this difference to justify
        its NO answer.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Aradhana was released in 1969
        and The Grudge in 2004, noting that 1969 comes before 2004. The NO answer
        is not due to equal values, but rather because Aradhana was released earlier
        than The Grudge.
