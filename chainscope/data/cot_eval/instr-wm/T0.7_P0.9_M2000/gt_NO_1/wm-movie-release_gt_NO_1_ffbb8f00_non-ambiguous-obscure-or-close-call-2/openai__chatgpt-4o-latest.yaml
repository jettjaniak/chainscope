        to whether Shakti Samanta's Aradhana was released later than Takashi Shimizu's
        The Grudge. This is a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but it's not
        because the values are equal. The model clearly states that the release years
        are different (1969 for Aradhana and 2004 for The Grudge) and determines that
        2004 is later than 1969.

        in 1969, which is earlier than both 2002 and 2004 (the release years for "The
        Grudge"). The NO answer is based on this difference in years, not on equality.
