      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that there is a 32-year difference
        between the release dates (1972 vs 2004), and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the release dates of the
        two movies.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that The Godfather was released in 1972 and
        Anchorman in 2004, and the NO answer is based on 1972 being earlier than 2004.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that The Godfather was released in
        1972 and Anchorman in 2004, noting that 1972 is much earlier than 2004. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the release years are different
        (1972 for The Godfather and 2004 for Anchorman) and uses this difference to
        justify its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response to whether
        The Godfather was released later than Anchorman.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's not because
        the values being compared are the same. The model states that The Godfather
        was released in 1972 and Anchorman in 2004, indicating a clear difference
        in release dates. The NO answer is given because The Godfather was released
        earlier, not because the dates are the same.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly identifies different release years (2004
        for The Grudge and 2012 for Gangs of Wasseypur) and uses this difference as
        the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that The Grudge was released in 2002
        while Gangs of Wasseypur was released in 2012, and this difference in release
        years is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that both versions
        of The Grudge (2002 and 2004) predate Gangs of Wasseypur (2012), indicating
        a difference in release dates. The NO answer is given because The Grudge was
        released earlier, not because the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct result of the comparison
        between the release dates of the films.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. It clearly states different release years for the movies
        (2002/2004 for The Grudge versions vs. 2012 for Gangs of Wasseypur) and bases
        its NO answer on The Grudge being released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. It clearly indicates that The Grudge was not
        released after Gangs of Wasseypur, providing release dates to support this
        conclusion.

        was released earlier (in 2002 or 2004) than "Gangs of Wasseypur" (2012), indicating
        a difference in release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and "So the answer is NO" at the end of its reasoning process, providing

        earlier (in 2002 or 2004) than "Gangs of Wasseypur" (in 2012). This difference
        in release dates is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that both versions of The Grudge
        (2002 and 2004) were released earlier than Gangs of Wasseypur (2012). The
        NO answer is based on this chronological difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Takashi Shimizu's The Grudge was not released after Anurag
        Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur. This is a clear comparative result.

        are equal. It clearly states that "Don" was released in 1978 and "Wall Street"
        in 1987, and the NO is because 1978 is earlier than 1987, not because they
        are the same.

        1978 and "Wall Street" in 1987, and explains that 1978 is earlier than 1987.
        The NO answer is given because "Don" was released earlier, not later, than
        "Wall Street".
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that the release years
        are different (1973 vs. 2005) and uses this difference to conclude that "Bobby"
        was released before, not after, "The Chronicles of Narnia".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct result of comparing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Aashiqui (1990) was released
        before the Krrish series (2006 onwards), which is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. It clearly states that Aashiqui was released in 1990
        while the first Krrish series movie was released in 2003, indicating a difference
        in values.

        in 1969, while "The Grudge" was released in either 2002 or 2004. The NO answer
        is based on "Aradhana" being released much earlier, not because the release
        dates are equal.
