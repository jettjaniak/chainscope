    8ba00ccb-770f-4c66-aa1a-12997bc535e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly identifies different release years (1969 and 2002) and
        states that 1969 is earlier than 2002, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative result.'

    d6d6fd1c-3295-44d8-ab41-9759564fe254:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. It clearly states that Aradhana was released in 1969
        and The Grudge in 2002, indicating a difference in release years. The NO answer
        is given because Aradhana was released earlier, not later as the question
        asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by an explanation that Aradhana was released earlier than The Grudge.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Aradhana was released 33 years earlier
        than The Grudge, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: NO" at
        the end of its response.'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so this question
        does not apply.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that "Meet the Parents" was released
        19 years earlier than "Chhichhore", which is a significant difference in release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that "Meet the Parents" was released

        for the NO answer.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly identifies different release dates for the
        two movies and states that one is earlier than the other.

        of its response, providing a clear comparative result.'

        are the same. Instead, it clearly identifies different release years (2000
        and 2019) and bases its NO answer on the fact that Meet the Parents was released
        earlier, not later, than Chhichhore.
