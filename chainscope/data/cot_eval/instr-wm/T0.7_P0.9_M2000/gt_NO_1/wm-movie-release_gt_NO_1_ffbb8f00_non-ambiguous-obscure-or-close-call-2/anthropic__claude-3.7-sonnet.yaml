        years) are equal. It clearly identifies different release years (1969 and
        2004) and states that 1969 comes before 2004 as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Aradhana was released later than The Grudge.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are the same. It clearly states that Aradhana was released in 1969
        and The Grudge in 2004, and concludes that Aradhana was released earlier,
        not later.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that "Aradhana" was released
        in 1969 and "The Grudge" in 2004, with "Aradhana" being released earlier.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "Aradhana" was released later than "The Grudge".
        This is a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found that
        Aradhana (1969) was released earlier than The Grudge (2004), not because the
        values are the same. It clearly states a difference in the release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        It clearly identifies that "Meet the Parents" was released in 2000 and "Chhichhore"

        "Meet the Parents" was released "about 19 years earlier" than "Chhichhore".
        This difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Meet the Parents
