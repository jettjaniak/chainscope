      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that UCSF is west of BU, citing
        their positions on opposite coasts of the United States.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that UCSF is west of Boston University because
        California is on the West Coast and Massachusetts is on the East Coast of
        the United States.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this analysis,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal. It notes that they are at "similar longitudes" but not identical, and
        also mentions that Cornell is north of Columbia. The primary reason for the
        NO answer appears to be that Cornell is not east of Columbia, rather than
        them being in the same location.

        Medicine is in the western part of New York, while the School of International
        and Public Affairs at Columbia University is in the southeastern part. This
        difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
