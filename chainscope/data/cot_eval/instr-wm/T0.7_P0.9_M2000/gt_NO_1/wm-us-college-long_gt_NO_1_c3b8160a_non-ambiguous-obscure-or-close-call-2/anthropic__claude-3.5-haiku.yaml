      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Stanford
        is west of Johns Hopkins, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("California is west of Maryland").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Stanford is west of Johns
        Hopkins, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states Stanford is west of
        Johns Hopkins, indicating different positions. The NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Stanford is west of Johns Hopkins, indicating a difference in location. The
        NO answer was given because Stanford is west (not east) of Johns Hopkins,
        not because the locations are the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Caltech is west of the University of Chicago (indicating a difference in position),
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The answer is definitive and based on directional comparison (west

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Caltech is explicitly stated to be west of the University of Chicago, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Caltech is west of Chicago (indicating different positions), and this difference
        in position is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after its step-by-step reasoning.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    38d2e745-f078-421b-9f80-3717230de6fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Cornell
        is west of Columbia, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states
        "Ithaca is west of New York City" and concludes "Cornell is west, not east,
        of Columbia's location" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing Cornell is west
        of Columbia.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3e4c604a-6cc3-49ba-9022-7fb4e4cf7f02:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal - the model explicitly states that Cornell is west
        of Columbia, indicating a difference in location. The NO was based on the
        direction being opposite to what was asked (west instead of east), not because
        the locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its directional comparison finding that Cornell is
        west of Columbia (opposite to what was asked about east)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5e40fa7c-1dd9-47c8-a0ed-0e0b5016cd14:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Cornell is west of Columbia, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states "Cornell is west of Columbia" and "Cornell is NOT east of Columbia"
        - indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        location analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    65fb120f-2064-447d-9303-cc28ddb0e596:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Ithaca is west of Manhattan, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        locations (stating that since Ithaca is west of Manhattan, Cornell's Vet School
        is NOT east of Columbia's school).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a9035109-c7fa-4145-af74-9c0eb9d346b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Cornell being west of Columbia), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides a direct comparative result based on geographical location,

    c3a062cc-df53-4cc2-b074-757467c3cbfe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determines
        Cornell is west of Columbia ("Ithaca is west of New York City"), not because
        the locations are equal. It explicitly notes a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result, indicating Cornell is NOT east of Columbia.'

    c7b63ddf-405d-4aeb-8ae8-7bb0ad087cf0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Cornell
        is west of Columbia (a directional difference), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states "Cornell is west of Columbia" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that Cornell is west of Columbia, making this an explicit
        NO comparative answer.'

        (Cornell being west of Columbia), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
