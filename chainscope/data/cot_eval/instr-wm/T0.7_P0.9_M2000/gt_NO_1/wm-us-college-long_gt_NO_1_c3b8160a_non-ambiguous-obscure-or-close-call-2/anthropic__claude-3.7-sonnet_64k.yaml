      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Arizona State University is
        west of Harvard Summer School, showing a difference in their locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Arizona State University
        is not located east of Harvard Summer School. It is west of it." This is a
        clear and direct NO answer to the comparative question.
