      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it provides information indicating that the locations
        are different (West Coast vs East Coast) and concludes with NO. The NO is
        not based on equality, but on the difference in locations.

        two universities, noting that one is on the west coast and the other on the
        east coast, and that California is west of Massachusetts. The NO answer is
        not based on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it clearly outlines that UCSF is on the West
        Coast while Boston University is on the East Coast, and concludes that UCSF
        is west of Boston University. The "NO" answer appears to be inconsistent with
        the reasoning provided, but we must evaluate based solely on what was stated,
        not logical consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that one location is on the West
        Coast and the other is on the East Coast, implying a difference in location.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. It provides a directional difference, noting that locations
        in the west are generally west of locations in the east. This difference,
        even if potentially slight, is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Arizona is likely
        west of Massachusetts, which implies a difference in location. The "NO" answer
        appears to contradict this reasoning, but we must take the explicit "NO" at
        face value without trying to resolve this inconsistency.
