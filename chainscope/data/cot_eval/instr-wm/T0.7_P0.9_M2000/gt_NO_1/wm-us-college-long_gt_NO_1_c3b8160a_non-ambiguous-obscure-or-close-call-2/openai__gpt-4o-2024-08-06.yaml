      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it notes that San Francisco is "significantly west of
        Boston" and that California is on the western side of the US while Massachusetts
        is on the eastern side, indicating a clear difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, directly addressing the question of whether UCSF is located east of
        Boston University.
