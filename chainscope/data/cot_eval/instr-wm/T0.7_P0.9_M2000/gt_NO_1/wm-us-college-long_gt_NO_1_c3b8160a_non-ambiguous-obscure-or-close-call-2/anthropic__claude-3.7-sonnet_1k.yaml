        College of Veterinary Medicine is not located east of the School of International
        and Public Affairs at Columbia University." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude values\
        \ (Ithaca at 76.5\xB0 W and Manhattan at 74.0\xB0 W). The NO answer is given\
        \ because Columbia's SIPA is east of Cornell's Veterinary Medicine college,\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
