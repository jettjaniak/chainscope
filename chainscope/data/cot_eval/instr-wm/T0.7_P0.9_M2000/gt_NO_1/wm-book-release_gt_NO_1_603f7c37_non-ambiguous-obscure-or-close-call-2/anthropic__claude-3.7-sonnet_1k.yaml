      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "The World Is
        Flat" was released EARLIER than "The Last Lecture", indicating a difference
        in publication dates (2005 vs 2008).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Friedman's book
        was published in 2005 and Pausch's book in 2008, and concludes that 2005 comes
        before 2008. The NO answer is based on this difference in publication dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (publication
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies different years for each
        book's publication (2005 for Friedman's book and 2008 for Pausch's book) and
        uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Friedman's book was not released later than Pausch's
        book.

        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        on any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        for the two books (2005 for "The World Is Flat" and 2008 for "The Last Lecture")
        and bases its NO answer on "The World Is Flat" being published earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "The World Is Flat" was released later than "The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. It states that "The World Is Flat" was published in
        2005, while "The Last Lecture" was published in 2008, and explicitly notes
        that 2005 is earlier than 2008.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values being compared are the same. The model clearly states that Kadono's
        book was published in 1985 and Strout's book in 2008, indicating different
        publication dates. The NO answer is given because Kadono's book was published
        earlier, not later, than Strout's book.

        was published in 1992 and "Eragon" was published in 2003, indicating a difference
        in publication dates. The NO answer is given because "The Shadow Rising" was

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values being compared are the same. The model clearly states that "Coraline"
        was published in 2002 and "Heaven is for Real" was published in 2010, indicating
        different publication dates. The NO answer is given because "Coraline" was

        (1963 for "The Feminine Mystique" and 1977 for "Bridge to Terabithia") and
        bases its NO answer on the fact that 1963 comes before 1977.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        and states that "Bridge to Terabithia" was released later than "The Feminine
        Mystique." The NO answer is not due to equal values, but because the comparison
        shows one book was published later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        on this difference in publication dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as the final answer
