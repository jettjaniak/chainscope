      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that "The World Is Flat" was
        released in 2005, while "The Last Lecture" was released in 2008. The NO answer
        is based on 2005 being earlier than 2008, not on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "The World Is Flat" was released later than "The
        Last Lecture". This is a clear comparative result.
