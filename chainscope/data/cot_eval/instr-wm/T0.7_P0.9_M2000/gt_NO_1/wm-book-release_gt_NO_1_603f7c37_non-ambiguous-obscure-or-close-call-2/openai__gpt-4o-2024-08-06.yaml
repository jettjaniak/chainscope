      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "The World Is
        Flat" was published in 2005, which is earlier than "The Last Lecture," published
        in 2008. The NO answer is based on this difference in publication dates, not
        on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Schindler's Ark was published
        in 1982 and Misery was published in 1987, with Schindler's Ark being released
        earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference in publication dates, not
