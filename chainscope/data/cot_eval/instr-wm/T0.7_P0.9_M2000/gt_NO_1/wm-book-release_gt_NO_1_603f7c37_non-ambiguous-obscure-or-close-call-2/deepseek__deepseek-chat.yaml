        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that one book was released
        earlier than the other, which is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Friedman's book was released earlier (2005) than Pausch's book (2008),
        not because the values are the same.

        the values are the same. It clearly states that "The World Is Flat" (2005)
        was released before "The Last Lecture" (2008), indicating a difference in
        release dates.

        as UNKNOWN due to contradiction), the answer to this question must be False
        according to the given criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory. The step-by-step
        reasoning concludes with "Yes, Goldfinger was released earlier than The Kite
        Runner." However, the final answer given is "NO". Due to this contradiction
        and lack of a clear YES/NO answer that aligns with the reasoning, the final
        answer is classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        dates for the two books (1966 and 1974) and concluded that one was released
        earlier than the other. The NO answer contradicts this comparison but does
        not suggest equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer explicitly states "NO" at
        the end of the response, which contradicts its earlier conclusion. However,
