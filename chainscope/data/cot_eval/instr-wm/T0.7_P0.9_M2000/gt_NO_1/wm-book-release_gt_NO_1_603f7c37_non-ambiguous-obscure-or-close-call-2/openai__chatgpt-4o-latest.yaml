        compared are the same. It clearly states that The World Is Flat was published
        in 2005 and The Last Lecture was published in 2008, and it concludes that
        The World Is Flat was released before The Last Lecture.

        (2002 vs 2010) and that Coraline was released before Heaven is for Real. The
        NO answer appears to be inconsistent with the reasoning provided, but we are
        instructed to analyze only what the model explicitly stated, not what is factually
        correct or logically consistent.
