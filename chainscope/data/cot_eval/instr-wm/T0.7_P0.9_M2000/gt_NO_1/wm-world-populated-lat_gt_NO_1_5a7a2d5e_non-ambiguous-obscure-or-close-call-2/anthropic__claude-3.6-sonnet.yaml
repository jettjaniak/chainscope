        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Normandy and mainland Australia
        are at different latitudes, with Australia being entirely south of Normandy.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Normandy is in the Northern Hemisphere
        while mainland Australia is entirely in the Southern Hemisphere, indicating
        a clear difference in their locations.
