      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly explains that Mainland Australia is in the
        Southern Hemisphere while Normandy is in the Northern Hemisphere, indicating
        a significant difference in their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mainland Australia
        is not located north of Normandy." This is a clear and direct NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Normandy and Mainland Australia
        are in different hemispheres with different latitude ranges, which is the
        reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Mainland Australia is south
        of Normandy, with Normandy being in the Northern Hemisphere and Australia
        in the Southern Hemisphere. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
