      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly explains that Australia is in the Southern
        Hemisphere while Normandy is in the Northern Hemisphere, with a significant
        difference in latitude. The NO answer is based on this difference in hemispheres
        and latitudes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question asked.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Mainland Australia\
        \ is south of Normandy, with specific latitude comparisons showing a difference\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Mainland Australia
        is in the Southern Hemisphere (south of the equator) while Normandy is in
        the Northern Hemisphere (north of the equator), indicating a significant difference
        in their latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
