        of the equator while Normandy is north of the equator, and provides different
        latitude ranges for each location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Mainland Australia is located north of Normandy.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere
        while Normandy is in the Northern Hemisphere, and their respective latitudes
        make it impossible for Australia to be north of Normandy.

        its final conclusion.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere
        while Normandy is in the Northern Hemisphere, and that Australia is at a lower
        latitude (further south) than Normandy. This difference in position is the
        reason for the NO answer.
