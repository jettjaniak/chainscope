      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that 589 < 138,800, showing
        a difference in values and providing this as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        result, directly answering the question about whether Medina has a larger
        area than Java.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Java is much larger than Medina, specifically
        stating that Java is about 236 times larger than Medina.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing a step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Java is "much larger" than Medina,
        providing specific area measurements for each location that are vastly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, followed by a clarification in parentheses that Medina does not have
        a larger area than Java.
