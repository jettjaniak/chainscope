        Instead, it clearly indicates that Lisbon's area (100.05 square kilometers)
        is less than London's area (1,572 square kilometers), which is the reason
        for the NO answer.

        It clearly indicates that Lisbon's area (100.05 square kilometers) is less
        than London's area (1,572 square kilometers), and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.

        In fact, it explicitly mentions that Greater London (1,572 square kilometers)
        is significantly larger than Lisbon (84.8 square kilometers). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as the final answer
        when considering Greater London, which is the most common definition of London's
        area. Although it mentions that the answer depends on the definition used,
        it provides a clear comparative result for the most relevant definition.

        Instead, it notes a "significant difference in size, with London being much

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Lisbon's area (84.8 square kilometers)
        is significantly smaller than London's area (1,572 square kilometers). The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in area between Lisbon (100.05
        square kilometers) and London (1,572 square kilometers), and bases its NO
        answer on London being larger than Lisbon.
