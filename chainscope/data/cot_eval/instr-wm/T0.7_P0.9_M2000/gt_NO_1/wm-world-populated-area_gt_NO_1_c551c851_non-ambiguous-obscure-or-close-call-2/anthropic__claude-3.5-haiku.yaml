      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that London is "much larger" and "15-16 times larger" than Lisbon. The NO
        is based on London being larger, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Lisbon does NOT have a larger area
        than London. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the areas are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly stated that Tahiti (1,045 sq km) is "significantly
        larger" and "much larger" than Amsterdam-Centrum (8 sq km), and this difference
        in size was the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that Crete is MUCH larger than Manhattan (about 141 times larger). The NO
        is based on a clear difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" and "The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Crete is much larger than Manhattan"
        and shows different values (59.1 sq km vs 8,336 sq km). The NO answer is based
        on Crete being larger, not on the values being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the areas are
        equal - it explicitly states that Crete (8,336 sq km) is much larger than
        Manhattan (59.1 sq km), with Crete being about 141 times larger. The NO is
        due to this size difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        difference in values, not equality. The values given (8,336 sq km vs 59.1
        sq km) are distinctly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states that Ireland is "significantly
        larger" and "more than three times the area of Crimea." It gives specific
        different values (27,000 sq km vs 84,421 sq km) and bases its NO answer on
        Ireland being larger, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Republic of Crimea
        does NOT have a larger area than Ireland" as its final conclusion. This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        is SMALLER than Ireland (70,273 sq km), showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final comparative answer, stating

        that Crimea (27,000 sq km) is smaller than Ireland (70,273 sq km). The NO
        is based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal. The
        model clearly indicates different values and a smaller-than relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in the explanation "NO, Republic of Crimea does NOT have a larger area
        than Ireland" and as a final standalone "NO" answer. This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model explicitly
        stated the values were different (Ireland being "significantly larger"), not
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's reasoning concludes that Ireland is larger
        than Crimea, but then gives "NO" as the final answer, which contradicts its
        own analysis. Since there's a clear contradiction between the reasoning and
        the final answer, and no clear YES/NO comparative result can be determined,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Java's area (138,794 sq km) is MUCH
        larger than Medina's area (606 sq km)" and that "Java is significantly larger
        than Medina." The NO answer is based on Java being larger, not on the areas
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Medina does NOT have
        a larger area than Java" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Java (138,794 sq
        km) is "MUCH larger than" Medina (607 sq km). The NO is based on a clear difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, indicating that Medina does NOT have
        a larger area than Java. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

        times larger than Medina". The NO answer is based on Java being larger, not
        on the areas being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Medina does NOT have

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the areas are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Java (118,000 sq km)
        is "MUCH larger than" Medina (600 sq km). The NO answer was given because
        of this size difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats or uncertainty about making the
        determination. It provides specific area values and makes a definitive comparison.

        in size, noting "Java's area is much, much larger than Medina's area" and
        "Java is about 200 times larger than Medina". The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 4 saying "NO, Medina does NOT have a larger area than Java"

        areas are equal. The model explicitly states that Java is "MUCH larger than
        Medina" and "over 200 times larger." The NO is due to Java being larger, not
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats or uncertainty. It directly answers
        whether Medina has a larger area than Java.

        that Java is "MUCH larger than Medina" and provides different values (607
        sq km vs 138,794 sq km). The NO is based on Java being larger, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        is based on a clear difference in values, not on equality. The values given
        (600-700 sq km vs 138,794 sq km) are very different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats or qualifications about inability
        to determine. It provides specific area measurements and concludes that Java
        is larger than Medina.
