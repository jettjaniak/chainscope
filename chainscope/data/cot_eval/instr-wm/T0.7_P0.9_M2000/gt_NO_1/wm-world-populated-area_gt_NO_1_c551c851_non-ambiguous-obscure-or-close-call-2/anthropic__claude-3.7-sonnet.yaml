        Instead, it clearly indicates that the Republic of Crimea (27,000 sq km) is
        smaller than Ireland (70,273 sq km). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Republic of Crimea
        does not have a larger area than Ireland." This is a clear comparative NO
        answer.

        It clearly indicates that Long Island is larger than Giza city, and even when
        considering Giza Governorate, it states that it is "slightly larger than Long
        Island". The NO answer is based on a difference in size, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Giza does not have

        In fact, it concludes that Long Island is larger than the city of Giza, which
        is a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answers NO, then rechecks its

        It explicitly notes that Giza Governorate (1,580 sq km) is larger than Long
        Island (1,401 sq km), which is the reason for the NO answer.

        It notes that Giza Governorate is larger than Long Island's land area but
        smaller than Long Island's total area. The NO answer is based on a difference
        in size, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        It compares two different interpretations of Giza (city and governorate) to
        Long Island, finding that the city is smaller and the governorate is slightly
        larger. The NO answer is based on the city interpretation being much smaller,
        not on equal values.

        Long Island (1,400 sq km), which is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
