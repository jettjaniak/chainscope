        Instead, it clearly indicates that London's area (1,579 square kilometers)
        is significantly larger than Lisbon's area (100 square kilometers). The NO
        answer is based on this difference in size, not on equality.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that the area associated with the River Nile

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Capri has a much smaller area compared
        to any interpretation of the "River Nile (state)". The model states "Given
        the significant difference in scale, comparing the area of Capri (10.4 square
        kilometers) to any of the larger areas associated with the River Nile (such
        as Egypt or the Nile Basin) shows that Capri has a much smaller area." This
        difference in size is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on the comparison,
        the answer to whether Capri has a larger area than the "River Nile (state)"
        (interpreting this as any significant geopolitical or geographical entity
        associated with the Nile) is clearly NO." This is a clear and direct NO answer

        The NO answer is based on this significant difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Shinjuku's area (18.23 square kilometers)
        is less than Houston's area (1,625 square kilometers), which is the reason
        for the NO answer.
