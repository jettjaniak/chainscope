      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that "The Subtle Knife" has fewer pages (326)
        than "Stranger in a Strange Land" (438). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "The Subtle Knife" has more pages than "Stranger
        in a Strange Land".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. It clearly states that "The Subtle Knife" has 326 pages
        while "Stranger in a Strange Land" has 408 pages, showing a difference in
        page counts.

        has fewer pages (326) than both versions of Stranger in a Strange Land (408
        or 528 pages).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Instead, it clearly indicates that "I, Robot" has 224 pages while "Jurassic

        Instead, it clearly identifies different page counts (224 for "I, Robot" and
        400 for "Jurassic Park") and bases its NO answer on "I, Robot" having fewer
        pages than "Jurassic Park".

        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in page counts (224 vs 400) and
        states that I, Robot has "significantly less" pages than Jurassic Park.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, directly addressing the question of whether I, Robot has more pages
        than Jurassic Park.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that "Jurassic Park (~400 pages) has significantly
        more pages than I, Robot (~224 pages)." This difference in values is the reason
        for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly shows that the page counts are different (253 for I, Robot
        and 399 for Jurassic Park) and uses this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that "Jurassic Park" (400 pages) has more pages
        than "I, Robot" (224 pages). The NO answer is given because "I, Robot" has
        fewer pages, not because the values are the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it notes that The God Delusion (464 pages) has significantly more
        pages than Artemis Fowl (277 pages), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Artemis Fowl does
        not have more pages than The God Delusion" as its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in page counts (277 vs 464) and
        concludes that The God Delusion has more pages than Artemis Fowl.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Artemis Fowl has more pages than The God Delusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Instead, it clearly indicates that "The God Delusion" has significantly more
        pages (463) than "Artemis Fowl" (277).
