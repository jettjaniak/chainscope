      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows different values (326 vs
        528 pages) and states that one is less than the other (326 < 528). The NO
        is given because one value is less than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explicitly

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        different page counts (200 vs 400 pages) and concludes "Jurassic Park has
        more pages than I, Robot." The NO answer was not based on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While this seems inconsistent with its reasoning (which suggests Jurassic
        Park has more pages), we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated
        as the final answer, not whether it makes logical sense.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in page counts, noting that "I, Robot is significantly shorter" and "Jurassic
        Park is a longer novel." The NO answer was based on this difference, not on
        equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the page counts are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that "Jurassic Park is significantly
        longer than I, Robot" and "has roughly twice as many pages." The NO answer
        appears to be given despite noting these differences, not because the values
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the reasoning suggests Jurassic Park has more pages, we must take the
        explicit "NO" answer at face value when classifying the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in page counts (Jurassic Park ~400-450 pages vs I, Robot ~224-256 pages) and
        gives this difference (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Jurassic Park is
        "significantly longer" and has "almost twice as many pages" compared to I,
        Robot. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear reasoning process leading to that conclusion
        based on page counts.

        in page counts, noting that Jurassic Park is "longer by about 150-200 pages"
        and that "I, Robot is significantly shorter". The NO answer was based on this
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the books have equal page
        counts. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Jurassic Park is significantly
        longer" and "has roughly 200 more pages" than I, Robot. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (I, Robot does NOT
        have more pages than Jurassic Park)" as its final answer. This is a clear
        comparative NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found different page counts (200-250 vs 400-450
        pages) and gave NO because Jurassic Park has more pages than I, Robot.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed different page counts
        (230 vs 385 pages) and stated "The Wolf of Wall Street has more pages than
        Disgrace." The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its reasoning which shows Wolf of Wall Street
        has more pages. Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit final answer
        rather than resolve contradictions, we classify this as NO.

        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted a difference in page counts
        (400-500 vs 700-800 pages) and concluded that "The Dark Tower V" has more
        pages than "Sofies verden". The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on its step-by-step

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states that 952 is greater than 608 and shows the
        difference between the page counts. The NO is based on one value being larger
        than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific page counts and
        a direct comparison showing McPherson's book has more pages than Mukherjee's.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (592
        vs 952 pages) and indicates McPherson's book has more pages. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer to whether Mukherjee's
        book has more pages than McPherson's book.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 952 is larger than
        592 and that McPherson's book has MORE pages than Mukherjee's book. The NO
        answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the page counts and finding that McPherson's book has MORE

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted that one book has more
        pages than the other (486 vs 192), showing a clear difference in values. The
        NO answer was not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though its reasoning suggests "Playing It My Way" has MORE pages than
        "Push". Despite this apparent contradiction, we must take the explicit final
        answer at face value.

        Last Lecture." The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific page counts and

        (517 vs 320 pages) and that "517 is greater than 320." The NO answer is given
        because one book has MORE pages than the other, not because they have equal
        page counts.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with "NO" appearing both in step 5 and as the final

        in page counts (The Lost World at 400-430 pages vs The Talented Mr. Ripley
        at 250-270 pages) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer.
        The values are not equal or same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the page counts, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "The Lost World appears to have
        more pages than The Talented Mr. Ripley" and gave NO based on this difference
        (approximately 400-430 pages vs 250-300 pages).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the page counts of both books and determining
        that The Lost World has more pages.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state

        stating "The Return of the King has significantly more pages" and giving different
        page ranges (200-250 vs 400-500 pages). Even though this contradicts the NO
        answer, we must base our classification purely on what was stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While this seems to contradict its reasoning (which suggests Return of the
        King has MORE pages), we must evaluate only the explicit final answer given,
        not whether it makes logical sense.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, even if we had considered the "NO"
        as final, the model explicitly states the books have different lengths, with
        Return of the King being "approximately double" the length of Carrie.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is inconsistent. While the step-by-step
        reasoning concludes "The Return of the King has more pages than Carrie", it
        then gives a final answer of "NO" which contradicts this reasoning. Since
        these statements are contradictory and there's no clear indication of which
        to prioritize, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in page counts ("My Sister's Keeper" appears to have more pages than "The
        Thursday Murder Club") and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
        The values are not equal or same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the page counts and finding that My Sister's Keeper has more

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that one book has 382 pages
        and the other has 423 pages, and specifically notes that "382 pages < 423
        pages". The NO answer is given because one value is less than (not equal to)
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, showing that The Thursday Murder Club does not have
        more pages than My Sister's Keeper. The answer is definitive and directly
        addresses the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the books have equal page
        counts. Instead, it explicitly states there is a large difference (30-40 pages
        vs 629 pages) and concludes "Eclipse has MANY more pages." The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion
        and provides a clear comparative result, stating that the Magic School Bus

        was a significant difference in page counts (30-40 pages vs 629 pages), not
        that they were equal. The NO was based on one book having more pages than
        the other, not because they had equal page counts.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        vs 629 pages) and gives the reason for NO as "40 is less than 629" - not because
        the values are equal. Since the values are different and inequality is the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Eclipse (629 pages) is significantly longer than the Magic School Bus
        book (32-40 pages). The values are explicitly stated to be different, not
        equal, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
