        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in page counts, with "Stranger

        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        Instead, it clearly indicates that "Stranger in a Strange Land" has more pages
        (408-525) than "The Subtle Knife" (approximately 326 pages). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in page counts, not on equality.

        Stranger in a Strange Land has more pages." This indicates a difference in
        values, not equality.

        number of pages. Instead, it clearly indicates that "The Dark Tower VII" is
        significantly longer than "Goldfinger" - roughly 2.5 to 3 times the length.
        This difference in length is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.

        longer than Fleming's book.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        states that 213 is less than 468. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear comparative result indicating that "The Perks of
