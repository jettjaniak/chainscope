        are equal. Instead, it notes that "Jurassic Park" generally has more pages
        than "I, Robot" based on typical editions. The NO answer is not due to equal
        values, but rather due to "Jurassic Park" having more pages.

      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that "Kiki's Delivery Service" has fewer pages
        (approximately 224) compared to "A Thousand Splendid Suns" (approximately
        384 pages). The NO answer is based on this difference in page counts, not
        on equality.
