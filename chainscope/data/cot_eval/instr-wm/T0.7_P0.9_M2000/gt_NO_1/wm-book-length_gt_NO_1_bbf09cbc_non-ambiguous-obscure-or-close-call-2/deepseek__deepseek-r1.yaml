      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states that "Misery" has 320 pages while
        "White Teeth" has 448 pages, and the NO answer is given because 320 is less
        than 448.

        book (around 280-300 for Artemis Fowl vs. 400+ for The God Delusion).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this NO is given as a direct result of the
        comparison between the page counts of the two books.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. It clearly states that "The God Delusion" has 464 pages
        while "Artemis Fowl" has 277 pages, and concludes that "The God Delusion"
        has more pages than "Artemis Fowl".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this NO is given as a direct result of the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the page counts are
        equal. Instead, it concludes that The God Delusion has more pages than Artemis
        Fowl, citing specific (though uncertain) page counts of around 464 for The
        God Delusion and 277 for Artemis Fowl.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question of whether Artemis Fowl has more
        pages than The God Delusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that The God Delusion has significantly more
        pages (~400+) than Artemis Fowl (~280). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this is reinforced in the step-by-step explanation.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the page counts are
        equal. It clearly indicates that The God Delusion has more pages (around 400)
        than Artemis Fowl (around 280), and this difference in page count is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Artemis Fowl does
        not have more pages than The God Delusion" as its final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the page counts are
        equal. Instead, it concludes that The God Delusion has more pages than Artemis
        Fowl, citing specific page count estimates (around 464 vs 320 pages). The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Artemis Fowl has more pages than The God Delusion. This is a clear
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the page counts are
        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that The God Delusion has more pages
        than Artemis Fowl, noting specific page ranges for each book (280-300 for
        Artemis Fowl vs 400-464 for The God Delusion). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in page counts, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and provides a clear explanation for why Artemis
        Fowl does not have more pages than The God Delusion.
