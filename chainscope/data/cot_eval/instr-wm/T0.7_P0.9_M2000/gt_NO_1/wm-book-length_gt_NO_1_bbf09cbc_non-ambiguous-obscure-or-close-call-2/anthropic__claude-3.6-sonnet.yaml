      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because Vincent's
        book has fewer pages (163) than King's book (1,138), not because the values
        are equal. The model clearly states that 163 < 1,138.

        than Artemis Fowl, which is the reason for the NO answer.

        answer, followed by a clarification in parentheses.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Artemis Fowl has fewer pages (280-300)
        than The God Delusion (400), and this difference is the reason for the NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Artemis Fowl has fewer pages than The God
        Delusion, with a difference of roughly 80-100 pages.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Artemis Fowl has fewer pages than The God
        Delusion, even accounting for different editions. The NO answer is given because
        Artemis Fowl has fewer pages, not because the page counts are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as a direct answer to the comparative question.
