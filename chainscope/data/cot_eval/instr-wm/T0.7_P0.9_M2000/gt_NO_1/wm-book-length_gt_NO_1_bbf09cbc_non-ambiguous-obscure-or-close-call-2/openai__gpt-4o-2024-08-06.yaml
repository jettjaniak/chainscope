      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (page counts)
        are equal. Instead, it notes a difference in page counts, with "Stranger in
        a Strange Land" having more pages than "The Subtle Knife". This difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question of whether "The Subtle Knife" has more pages than
        "Stranger in a Strange Land".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that "The God Delusion" has more pages (400-420)
        than "Artemis Fowl" (280-300), and this difference is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether "Artemis Fowl" has more pages than "The God Delusion".
