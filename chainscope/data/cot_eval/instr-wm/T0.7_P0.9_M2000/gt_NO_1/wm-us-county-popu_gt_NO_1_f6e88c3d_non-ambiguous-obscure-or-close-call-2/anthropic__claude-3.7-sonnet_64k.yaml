      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that King County has a significantly
        larger population than DC (approximately 2.2 million vs. 690,000). The model
        explicitly notes this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is District of Columbia, DC more populous than King County,
        WA?" This is clearly stated in both the reasoning section and the final answer
        section.

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that there is a significant
        difference in population between the two counties, with Cook County having
        about 700,000 more residents than Maricopa County. The model provides specific
