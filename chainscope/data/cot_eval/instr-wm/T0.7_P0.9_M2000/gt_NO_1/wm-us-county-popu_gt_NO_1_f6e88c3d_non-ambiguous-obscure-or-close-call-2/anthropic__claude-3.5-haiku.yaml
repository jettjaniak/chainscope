      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values,
        it does not indicate they are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is
        a difference (2.3 million vs 1.9 million) and uses this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on Clark County being larger, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly makes a comparative conclusion that "Clark County (2.3 million)
        is larger than Santa Clara County (1.9 million)" followed by "Santa Clara
        County is NOT more populous than Clark County."

        Clark County is MORE populous (2.3M vs 1.9M), not because the values are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a difference in population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Clark County (2.3
        million) is larger than Santa Clara County (1.9 million). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal. The model
        clearly identifies a size difference between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Santa Clara County is NOT more populous than Clark
        County." This is a direct comparative answer.

        the values are equal. The model explicitly shows different population values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        million) has a larger population than San Francisco County (815,000). The
        NO was due to this difference in values, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, showing that San Francisco County is NOT more populous
        than Bronx County. This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.

        for its NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        being larger). The NO is not based on equal values, but rather on a clear
        difference in population.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations and finding Cook
        County to be larger by 600,000 people.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5a1892fe-2e6f-414f-ae9d-8e3c3a2da033:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (4.4 million
        vs 5.1 million) and states "4.4 million < 5.1 million" as the reason for its
        NO answer. The values are not equal, and inequality is the basis for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Maricopa County is more populous than Cook County.
        The answer is explicit and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    864c3815-9d1b-443b-a3e7-49e0b26057e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Cook County is larger
        by about 600,000 people (4.5M vs 5.1M). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question about population. The answer
        is explicit and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b30584c6-a1ff-4e7d-b758-638d88fd4b0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Cook County (5.1
        million) is more populous than Maricopa County (4.5 million), showing a clear
        difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations and finding Cook
        County to be more populous than Maricopa County.'

    b5d66ca3-131d-4a83-b22d-90413ae2e596:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference of about 600,000 people between the counties (Cook County
        having more). The NO is not due to equal values, but because Cook County has
        a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Maricopa County is more populous than Cook County.
        The answer is direct and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c3964a89-d4c3-4346-a8e1-07a1e4f6a9e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values are different (4.5 million vs 5.1 million), not because they are equal.
        It explicitly states "Maricopa County is smaller in population than Cook County."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and finding that Maricopa County
        has a smaller population than Cook County.

    d240e882-7414-4d47-90bd-5169df916dac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states different values (4.5M vs 5.1M) and indicates
        Cook County is more populous than Maricopa County. The NO is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and finding Cook County (5.1M)
        to be more populous than Maricopa County (4.5M)

    e36be948-88a3-451a-81f1-13bfcb9a004f:

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        of about 600,000 people between the counties (Cook County having more), and
        this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal
        or same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (4.5M vs 5.1M), not because the values were equal. It explicitly states
        "Maricopa County is smaller in population than Cook County"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
