      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that the population of DC (700,000) is less
        than the population of King County, WA (2.3 million). This difference in values
        is the reason for the NO answer.

        Instead, it clearly shows that the populations are different (705,749 for
        DC < 2,252,970 for King County) and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer.

        Instead, it clearly identifies that King County has a larger population (2,260,105)
        compared to DC (670,050). The NO answer is given because King County's population
        is greater, not because the values are the same.

        It clearly indicates that Orange County, CA has a much larger population (over

        is based on this significant difference in population, not on equality.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Orange County, CA has a larger population

        Orange County is more populous, not because the values are the same.

        In fact, it provides different population numbers for Sacramento County (1,585,055)
        and Dallas County (2,574,530), indicating a difference in values. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
