      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it notes a difference in longitude (118 degrees west vs 73 degrees
        west) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Los Angeles County,
        CA is not located east of Nassau County, NY." This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.
