      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Denver County
        is west of Kings County, indicating a difference in their geographical positions.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Denver County, CO located east of Kings County, NY?" The
        model provides a clear comparative result, stating that Denver County is west
        of Kings County, not east of it.
