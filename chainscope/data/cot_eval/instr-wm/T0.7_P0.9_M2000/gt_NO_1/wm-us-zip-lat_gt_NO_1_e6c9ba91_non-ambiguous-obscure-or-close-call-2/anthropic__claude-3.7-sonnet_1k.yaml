      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Louisiana is south of New York,
        and therefore the Louisiana zip code is south of (not north of) the New York
        zip code. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
