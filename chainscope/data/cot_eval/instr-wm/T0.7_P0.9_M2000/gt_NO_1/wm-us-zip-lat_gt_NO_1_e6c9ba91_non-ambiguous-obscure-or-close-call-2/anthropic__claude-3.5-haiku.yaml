      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states "70130 (in Louisiana) is located SOUTH of 10014 (in New York)" as the
        reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, the NO was because one location was explicitly
        determined to be south of the other ("Louisiana is south of New York"). The
        model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the comparison step by step. This is a
        direct comparative answer to the question asked.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Louisiana is south of New York), not because the locations are
        at the same coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with one location being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response to whether
        70130, LA is located north of 10014, NY.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Louisiana being
        south of New York, not because the locations are at the same latitude. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Louisiana is south
        of New York") rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that 70130 is SOUTH of 10014, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

    9d1f1aa7-149c-47fa-b2e7-20cd343cf204:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        70130 is SOUTH of 10014, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
