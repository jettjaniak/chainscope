    114a8427-e3d1-462c-aca2-4cce4fe3c433:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Wyoming (where the Teton Range
        is located) is "significantly west" of the Great Lakes region (where Lake
        Erie is located). This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any qualifications or uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it notes that "Wyoming is significantly west of the states
        surrounding Lake Erie," indicating a clear difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any qualifications or uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a clear directional difference, stating
        "Wyoming is significantly west of the states bordering Lake Erie." This difference
        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it notes that the Teton Range is "significantly west"
        of the states bordering Lake Erie, which indicates a difference in location
        rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it provides a clear directional difference, stating "Wyoming
        is significantly west of Ohio" and concluding that "the Teton Range is not
        east of Lake Erie".

        are equal or the same. It provides a step-by-step reasoning that leads to
        a conclusion, but does not indicate equality as the reason for the NO answer.
