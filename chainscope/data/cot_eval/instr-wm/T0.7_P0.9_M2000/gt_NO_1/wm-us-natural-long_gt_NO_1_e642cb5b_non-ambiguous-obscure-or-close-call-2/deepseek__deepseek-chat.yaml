      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range is "significantly
        west of Lake Erie" and uses this difference in position as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it notes that the Teton Range is "significantly farther
        west than Lake Erie" and there is a "substantial east-west separation" between
        them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values are equal.\
        \ Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in longitude values (110.5\xB0\
        \ W for Teton Range vs 81\xB0 W for Lake Erie) and uses this difference as\

    59641754-d2d8-4c29-adf0-a3cad883d316:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range is "significantly
        west" of Lake Erie, which is a directional difference.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that the Teton Range is west of Lake Erie,
        not east, indicating a difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative result.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it notes a significant difference in longitude between the two locations,
        with Lake Erie being "significantly east of the Teton Range".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range is west of Lake Erie, with
        different longitude values given for each location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative result.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range is in the western
        U.S. while Lake Erie is in the eastern U.S., emphasizing their different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO." as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range is "far to the
        west of Lake Erie" and "significantly to the west," which are differences
        in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range is west of Lake
        Erie, not east. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
