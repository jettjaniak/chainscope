      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that the Teton Range is west of Lake Erie,
        indicating a difference in their locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that the Teton Range is west of Lake Erie
        due to their geographical locations in different parts of the United States.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a reason based on the geographical locations
        of the Teton Range and Lake Erie, explaining that something in the western
        US cannot be east of something in the eastern US.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason based on the geographical
        locations of the two places, stating that something in the western US cannot
        be east of something in the eastern US.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Teton Range is in the
        Western United States while Lake Erie is in the Eastern United States, indicating
        a difference in their locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that the Teton Range is in the western United
        States while Lake Erie is in the eastern United States, and concludes that
        something in the west cannot be east of something in the east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range is west of Lake
        Erie, not east. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Teton Range, WY is located east of Lake Erie, OH.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explains that the Teton Range is in the western
        United States while Lake Erie is in the northeastern United States, indicating
        a difference in their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
