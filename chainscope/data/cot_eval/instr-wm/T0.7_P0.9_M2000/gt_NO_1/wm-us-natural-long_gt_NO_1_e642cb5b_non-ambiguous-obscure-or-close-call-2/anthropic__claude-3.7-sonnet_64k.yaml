      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range is west of
        Lake Erie, showing a difference in their positions. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Teton Range is
        not located east of Lake Erie. It is located west of Lake Erie." This is a
        clear and direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range is west of
        Lake Erie, providing specific longitude ranges to show the difference in their
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its reasoning, providing a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range
        is west of Lake Erie, not east. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct response to whether
        the Teton Range is located east of Lake Erie.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in location,
        stating that the Teton Range is west of Lake Erie, not east. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. It clearly concludes that the Teton Range, WY
        is not located east of Lake Erie, OH, but rather west of it.
