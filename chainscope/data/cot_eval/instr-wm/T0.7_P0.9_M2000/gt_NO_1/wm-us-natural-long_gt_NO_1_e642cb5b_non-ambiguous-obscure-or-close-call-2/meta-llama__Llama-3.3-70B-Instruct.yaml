    10d2df2d-290d-4185-8abe-45e1762e3cd0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that the Teton Range is west of Lake Erie,
        indicating a difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Teton Range, WY, is located east of Lake Erie, OH.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    23c2a590-6948-49fe-93ef-9f7ea45e884f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range is west of
        Lake Erie, not east. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, based on its analysis of the geographical locations
        of the Teton Range and Lake Erie.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range is west of Lake
        Erie, not east. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear comparative result.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that the Teton Range is in the western United
        States while Lake Erie is in the eastern United States, and concludes that
        something in the west cannot be east of something in the east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range is west of Lake
        Erie, with Wyoming being in the western part of the US and Ohio being in the
        eastern part.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Teton Range, WY is located east of Lake Erie, OH.
