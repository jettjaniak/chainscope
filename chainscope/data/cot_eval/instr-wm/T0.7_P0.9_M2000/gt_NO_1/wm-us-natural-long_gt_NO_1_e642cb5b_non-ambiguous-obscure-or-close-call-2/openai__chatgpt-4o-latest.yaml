      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it notes that the Teton Range is "significantly west of
        Lake Erie", indicating a clear difference in their positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range is west of
        Lake Erie, which is the reason for the NO answer.
