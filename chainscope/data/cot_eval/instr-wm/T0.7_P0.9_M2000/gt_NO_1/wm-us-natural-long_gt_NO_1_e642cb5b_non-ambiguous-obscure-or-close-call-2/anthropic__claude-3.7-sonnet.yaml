    00d2a713-f0ee-4b1b-a6a9-307d91dbc9cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range is located west
        of Lake Erie, showing a difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    248ae916-b8ad-41d1-87c4-05768e0cc095:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range is west of Lake
        Erie, not east. This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear and direct response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3e9286bd-e3a5-4388-9dab-cb14dac33530:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range is located to
        the west of Lake Erie, not to the east. This difference in location is the
        reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear negative response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    478f8c88-4a73-4954-993a-acce29d6a764:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range is west of Lake
        Erie, not east. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Teton Range, WY is located east of Lake Erie, OH. This is a
        clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    64e1f12b-ceb1-42b1-8663-21dc61ba158a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that the Teton Range is "significantly west
        of" Lake Erie, which indicates a clear difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Teton Range is located west
        of Lake Erie, not east of it. This difference in location is the reason for
        the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        \ Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in longitude (110\xB0 W for Teton\
        \ Range vs 83\xB0 W for Lake Erie) and uses this difference to conclude that\
