      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Teton Range is explicitly stated to be west of Lake Erie, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis
        showing that Teton Range is west of Lake Erie, not east of it.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    734c3eac-7a26-41ee-976d-2f882c893076:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, noting that "Teton Range is west of Lake Erie"
        and that Wyoming is a western state while Ohio is an eastern state. The NO
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        "Teton Range is NOT east of Lake Erie" as its conclusion after the step-by-step
        analysis. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    73a4a858-a9a6-40bf-8a65-4b3aa618c037:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        the Teton Range is west of Lake Erie, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("the Teton
        Range is west of Lake Erie").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" after determining that the Teton Range is west of Lake
        Erie and therefore NOT east of it.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7be9fd6d-be0b-4b2d-8940-cd0ff2aea25c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the Teton Range
        being "significantly west of Lake Erie" and "much further west," not because
        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result to the question about
        whether the Teton Range is east of Lake Erie.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9baa351d-d02c-4830-b72d-a35457437034:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        different (Teton Range being west of Lake Erie), not because they are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the Teton Range is west of Lake Erie, not east of it.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9e0ad613-f5e6-42e9-b106-6c05732dffe3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Teton Range being west of Lake Erie), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a geographical difference between the
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical comparison step by step.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    acf370e4-819a-4c90-bdd7-6c4a11c59eff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating
        "Teton Range is significantly west of Lake Erie" and "Lake Erie is much further
        east." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that "Teton Range
        is NOT located east of Lake Erie"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bcb26ad1-d228-4a74-bd42-7e6b739e954b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states they are different,
        with "Teton Range is significantly west of Lake Erie" as the reason for the
        NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" and clearly states that "Teton Range is NOT east of Lake Erie"'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cccfd4b2-8a40-492a-8b59-82623369bf1f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positioning
        (Teton Range being west of Lake Erie), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Teton Range is west of Lake Erie, not east".
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating that one location
        is not east of the other.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e5e1206f-dced-466e-81fa-f0845147c0b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they
        are in different positions ("opposite sides of the continental United States")
        and specifies that "The Teton Range is west of Lake Erie." The NO answer is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that the Teton Range is not
        east of Lake Erie. The answer is explicit and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
