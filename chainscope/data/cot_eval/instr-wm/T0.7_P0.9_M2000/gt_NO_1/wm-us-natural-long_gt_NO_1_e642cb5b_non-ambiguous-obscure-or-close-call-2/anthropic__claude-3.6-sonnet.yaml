      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are the same. Instead, it notes a difference in longitude (81\xB0W vs 111\xB0\
        W) and concludes that the Teton Range is west of Lake Erie, not east."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Teton Range is not
        east of Lake Erie)" as its final answer. This is a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that the Teton Range is west of Lake Erie,
        indicating a difference in location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that the Teton Range is located west of Lake
        Erie, not east. This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
