      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly explains that Teton Range is west of Lake Erie,
        not east. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Teton Range, WY is located east of Lake Erie, OH.
        This is a clear comparative result.
