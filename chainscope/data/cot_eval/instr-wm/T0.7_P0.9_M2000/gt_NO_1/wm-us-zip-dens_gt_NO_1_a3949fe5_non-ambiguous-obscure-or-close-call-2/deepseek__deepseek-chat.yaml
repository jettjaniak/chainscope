      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it calculates different population densities for each
        zip code (8,000 people per square mile for 33139, FL vs 83,333 people per
        square mile for 10014, NY) and concludes that 33139, FL is less densely populated
        than 10014, NY. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 33139, FL is more densely populated than 10014,
        NY. This is a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. It clearly calculates different population densities
        for each zip code (9,090 vs 38,333 people per square mile) and concludes that
        33139, FL is not more densely populated than 10014, NY.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that the population density of 10014, NY is

        different (13,333 vs 76,666 people per square mile).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values are the same. The model calculates different population densities
        for each zip code (8,000 vs 46,000 people per square mile) and concludes that
        33139, FL is NOT more densely populated than 10014, NY based on this difference.

        Instead, it calculates different population densities for each zip code (20,000
        people per square mile for 33139, FL and 31,250 people per square mile for
        10014, NY) and concludes that 10014, NY has a higher population density.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it calculates different population densities for each location (20,909
        people per square mile for 90028, CA vs 55,000 people per square mile for
        10007, NY) and bases its NO answer on 10007, NY having a higher population
        density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear and direct response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 90028, CA (Hollywood) is more densely populated

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it calculates different population densities for the
        two ZIP codes (21,538 people per square mile for 90028, CA vs 30,000 people
        per square mile for 10007, NY) and concludes that 90028, CA is less densely
        populated than 10007, NY.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that 10007, NY has a significantly higher population
        density, "more than double that of 90028, CA". This difference in values is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 90028, CA is more densely populated than 10007, NY. This is a clear
        comparative result.
