        code 10007. This NO is given as a comparative result, directly answering the
        question posed.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    785f7c38-87be-4acd-856c-58866a68602f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it compares different population densities (13,400 people/sq mi vs
        30,000+ people/sq mi) and concludes that 10007 has a higher population density
        than 90028.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO." at the
        end of its response, providing a clear comparative result.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        It clearly indicates that ZIP code 10007 has a higher population density than
        ZIP code 90028, with specific estimates given (over 30,000 vs. 12,000-13,000
        people per square mile).

        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it calculates different density values for each ZIP code (11,034
        people/sq mi for 90028 and 20,000 people/sq mi for 10007) and concludes that
        10007 is more densely populated than 90028. The NO answer is given because
        90028 is not more densely populated than 10007, not because the values are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether ZIP code 90028 in California is more densely populated
        than ZIP code 10007 in New York.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
