        (Malibu) is more densely populated than 55425 (Bloomington), even though it
        contradicts this with its final "NO" answer. The NO is not based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly contradicts its preceding analysis that concluded
        90265 (Malibu, CA) is more densely populated than 55425 (Bloomington, MN).

        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 90028 in CA is not
        more densely populated than 10007 in NY." This is a clear comparative NO answer
        to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 10007 in New York is likely more densely
        populated than 90028 in California, indicating a difference in values. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 90028, CA is not
        more densely populated than 10007, NY." This is a clear comparative NO answer

        Instead, it clearly indicates that 10007 (Manhattan) has significantly higher
        population density than 90028 (Hollywood), providing specific density figures
        to show the difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 90028, CA is not
        more densely populated than 10007, NY." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it indicates that 10007 in New York has "significantly
        higher population density" than 90028 in California. This difference in values
        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 90028, CA is not
        more densely populated than 10007, NY." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        Instead, it indicates that 10007 in Lower Manhattan has "significantly higher
        population density than Hollywood (90028)". The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 90028, CA is not
        more densely populated than 10007, NY." This is a clear comparative NO answer
        to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 10007 in Lower Manhattan would have
        a higher population density than 90028 in Hollywood. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 90028, CA is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes have equal
        population density. Instead, it concludes that 90028 is NOT more densely populated
        than 10007, implying a difference in density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after a step-by-step analysis.

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 10007 in Manhattan would be significantly
        more densely populated than 90028 in Los Angeles, giving specific reasons
        for this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 90028 in CA is not
