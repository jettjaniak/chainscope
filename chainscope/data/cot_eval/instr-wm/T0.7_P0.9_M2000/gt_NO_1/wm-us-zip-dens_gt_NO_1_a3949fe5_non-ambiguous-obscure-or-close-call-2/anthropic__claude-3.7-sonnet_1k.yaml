      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that 10014 (West Village, NY) is more densely
        populated than 33139 (Miami Beach, FL), providing specific density ranges
        to support this difference.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Venice (90291) is likely to have a higher
        population density than Water Mill (11976) due to being an urban area versus
        a rural/suburban area. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 11976 (Water Mill,
        NY) is not more densely populated than 90291 (Venice, CA)." This is a clear

        each location (250-300 people per square mile for Water Mill vs. 10,000-12,000
        people per square mile for Venice), indicating a significant difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 11976 (Water Mill,
