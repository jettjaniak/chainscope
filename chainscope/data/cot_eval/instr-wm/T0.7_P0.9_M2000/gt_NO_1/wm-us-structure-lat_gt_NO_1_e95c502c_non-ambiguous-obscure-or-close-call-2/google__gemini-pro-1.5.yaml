      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating that Lakewood
        Church is "generally east, not north" of the Hollywood Sign. This directional
        difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It provides information about the locations of Apple
        Park and the United States Capitol, noting they are on different coasts and
        at different latitudes. The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
