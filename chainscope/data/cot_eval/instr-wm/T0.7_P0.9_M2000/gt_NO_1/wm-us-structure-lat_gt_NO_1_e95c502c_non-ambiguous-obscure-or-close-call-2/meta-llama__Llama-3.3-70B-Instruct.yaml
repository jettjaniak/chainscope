      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Cupertino, CA (Apple Park)
        is south of Washington, D.C. (United States Capitol) in terms of latitude.
        This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Apple Park, CA is located north of the United States Capitol, DC.
        This is a clear comparative result.
