      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it states that Houston is "southeast
        of Los Angeles," indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Lakewood Church is "NOT north
        of" the Hollywood Sign.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Houston being south of Los Angeles), not because the locations are at the
        same latitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with one being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Lakewood Church is NOT north
        of the Hollywood Sign.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Houston
        is southeast of Los Angeles, not because the locations have equal latitude.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference (southeast), so this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Lakewood Church is NOT north
        of the Hollywood Sign.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states they are "quite far apart"
        and that Houston is "east and southeast of Los Angeles," indicating a clear
        directional difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative position of Lakewood
        Church in relation to the Hollywood Sign.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states the NO is because
        "Houston is southeast of Los Angeles" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Houston is "east and south of Los Angeles"), not because the
        locations are at the same latitude. The model indicates there is a difference
        in position, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Houston
        is southeast of Los Angeles, not because the locations are at the same coordinates.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Houston is actually
        southeast of Los Angeles"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Lakewood Church is not north of
        the Hollywood Sign.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Houston is "much further east and southeast compared to Los
        Angeles"), not because the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly
        notes a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Lakewood Church is NOT located
        north of the Hollywood Sign.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional

        in position (California being south of DC) is the basis for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Apple Park is NOT north of
        the US Capitol.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations have
        equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a difference, with
        Washington DC being "slightly further north than Cupertino" and Apple Park
        being "SOUTH of the US Capitol".
