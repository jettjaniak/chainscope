        Instead, it clearly indicates that Palo Alto has a much larger population

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 70112, LA is not
        more populous than 10024, NY" as its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that 10024, NY is far more populous than 70112,
        LA, with populations of approximately 50,000 and 3,000 respectively. The NO
        answer is given because 70112, LA is less populous, not because the values
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 70112, LA is more populous than 10024, NY.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that the population of 10024, NY is significantly
        larger than that of 70112, LA. This difference in population is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear and direct response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates a significant difference in population between
        the two zip codes (3,000 vs 50,000).
