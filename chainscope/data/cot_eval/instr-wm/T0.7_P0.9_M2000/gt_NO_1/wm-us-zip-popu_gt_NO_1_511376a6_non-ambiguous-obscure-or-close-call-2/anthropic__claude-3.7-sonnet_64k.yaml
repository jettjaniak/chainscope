      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that 10014, NY (West Village) has a larger population
        than 90265, CA (Malibu), providing population ranges that do not overlap.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 90265, CA more populous than 10014, NY?" This is a clear
        comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it provides different population estimates for each zip code
        (approximately 13,000 for 90265 and approximately 31,000 for 10014) and concludes
        that 10014 is significantly more populous than 90265.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that 90265 (CA) is NOT more populous than 10014 (NY). This is a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it consistently argues that 10014 (West Village, NY) likely
        has a higher population than 90265 (Malibu, CA) due to the higher density
        in Manhattan compared to Malibu.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        multiple times throughout the response, concluding that 90265 (Malibu, CA)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that 94027 (Atherton,
        CA) has a population of approximately 7,000-8,000 residents, while 10001 (Manhattan,
        NY) has a population of at least 20,000-30,000 people. The model's NO answer
        is based on this significant difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the reasoning section and in the formal answer section at the end
        of the response.

        population than 94027, describing differences in density and housing types
        between the two areas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 94027 is not more

        of residents. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that 94027, CA is not more populous than

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that the population of 10003, NY
        is significantly larger than the population of 33139, FL. The model provides
        estimated population ranges showing a clear difference between the two zip
        codes.
