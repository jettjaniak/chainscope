        Instead, it concludes that ZIP code 10024 in New York is significantly more
        populous than ZIP code 70112 in Louisiana, giving specific population estimates
        that differ greatly.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that ZIP code 10024 in NY has a much larger
        population (over 60,000) than ZIP code 70112 in LA (roughly 3,000-4,000).
        The NO answer is based on this significant difference in population, not on
        equality.
