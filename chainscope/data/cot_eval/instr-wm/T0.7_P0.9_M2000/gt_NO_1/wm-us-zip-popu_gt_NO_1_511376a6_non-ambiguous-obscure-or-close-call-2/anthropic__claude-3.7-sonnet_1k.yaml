      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates a significant difference in population, stating
        that the New York zip code has "roughly three times the population of the
        California zip code."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that 02554, MA (Nantucket) is "significantly
        less populous" than 11201, NY (Brooklyn Heights/DUMBO). The model provides
        specific population estimates showing a large difference between the two zip
        codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion,

        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Brooklyn's 11201 has "several times
        more residents than Nantucket's 02554". The NO answer is based on this significant
        difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether zip code 02554 in Massachusetts is more populous than zip code

        population is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that 11201 (Brooklyn, NY) has a significantly
        larger population than 02554 (Nantucket, MA). The model estimates Nantucket's
        population at 11,000-14,000 and Brooklyn's 11201 at over 50,000.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it notes a substantial difference in population, stating "The population
        difference is substantial - the Brooklyn ZIP code has several times the population
        of Nantucket." This difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (02554, MA is not

        in population between the two zip codes, with 11201 (Brooklyn) being much
        more populous than 02554 (Nantucket).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 02554, MA is not

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating that 89109
        has a higher population than 90028. This difference is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it provides specific population ranges for each ZIP
        code and concludes that 89109 (Las Vegas) has more permanent residents than
        90028 (Hollywood). The NO answer is given because the question asked if 89109
        was more populous, and the model determined it was actually less populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to the question "Is 89109, NV more populous than 90028, CA?" This is
        a clear and direct NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it concludes that 89109 is slightly more populous than 90028, stating
        "Based on population estimates, the Las Vegas zip code 89109 typically has
        slightly more permanent residents than the Hollywood zip code 90028." This
        difference, even though described as "slightly more," is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 89109, NV more populous than 90028, CA?". The model provides

        Instead, it provides approximate population figures for each zip code, showing
        that 90028 has a higher population (21,000-25,000) compared to 89109 (13,000-16,000).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.

        in population. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 89109 (NV) is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 90028, CA is likely
        more populous than 89109, NV due to the nature of the areas (commercial vs.
        residential) and typical population patterns. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 89109, NV is not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that ZIP code 10003 has a higher
        population than ZIP code 33139, providing estimates that show a difference
        in population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by an explanation that ZIP code 10003 in New York is more populous
        than ZIP code 33139 in Florida.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes that 10003 in New York has a higher population
        than 33139 in Florida, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 33139, FL more populous than 10003, NY?"

        this must be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it believes the population of ZIP code 10012 in
        New York is larger than ZIP code 94133 in California.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it provides specific population ranges for each ZIP code and
        concludes that 94133, CA has a slightly higher population than 10012, NY.
        This difference in population is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 10012, NY is more populous than 94133, CA. This is a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, so according to the instructions,
        this must be False. Additionally, the model did not state that the values
        were equal, but rather that 94133 has a slightly higher population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially stated "NO" but then corrected
        itself, indicating that 94133 in San Francisco has a slightly higher population
        than 10012 in New York. This correction implies a "YES" answer to the question
        "Is 10012, NY more populous than 94133, CA?"

        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, indicating that ZIP code 10012 in Manhattan has a higher population

        equal. Instead, it concludes that the Manhattan zip code (10024) has a "significantly
        larger population" than the Louisiana zip code (70112). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 70112 (Louisiana)
        is not more populous than 10024 (New York)." This is a clear comparative NO

        have a significantly larger population than 70112 in New Orleans. This difference
        in population is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (70112, LA is not
