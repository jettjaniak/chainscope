      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it provides specific population estimates for each zip code, noting
        that 10014 (20,000-25,000) is more populous than 90265 (10,000-12,000). The
        NO answer is based on this population difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it concludes that 10014, NY is more populous than 90265, CA, estimating
        20,000-30,000 residents for 10014 compared to 12,000-13,000 for 90265. The

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating
        that 10014 (NY) has a population of around 23,000-25,000, while 90265 (CA)
        likely has a lower population as it's a portion of Malibu's total population
        of about 12,000.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its thought process and in the formal answer at

        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Instead, it clearly indicates that 10014 has a higher population (23,000-25,000)
        than 90265 (approximately 12,000). This difference in values is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question of whether 90265 is
        more populous than 10014.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in population, with 90265 (Malibu)
        having approximately 12,000 residents and 10014 (West Village) having around
        23,000 residents. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly comparing the populations of the two zip codes and concluding that
        90265 is not more populous than 10014.

        Instead, it estimates different population values for each zip code (90265
        at 12,000-13,000 and 10014 at over 20,000) and concludes that 10014 is more
        populous than 90265.

        of around 1,100, while 11201 (Brooklyn, NY) has a population exceeding 30,000.
        The NO answer is based on this significant difference in population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and provides a clear explanation supporting this
        answer.

        larger population (40,000+) compared to 02554, MA (14,255).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 02554, MA is not

        has a significantly higher population than 02554, MA (approximately 1,200
        residents). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

        automatically False according to the given criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparative question. It spent the entire response analyzing and considering
        various possibilities about the zip codes and their populations, but never
        reached a definitive conclusion or stated a final comparative answer.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in population, estimating
        Chilmark (02554) to have around 1,000-2,000 residents, while Brooklyn (11201)
        is estimated to have tens of thousands of residents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, explaining that 02554 (Chilmark,

        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that 02554 (Chilmark, MA) has a population
        of approximately 1,200-1,500, while 11201 (Brooklyn, NY) has a population
        of about 25,000-30,000. The NO answer is given because of this significant
        difference in population, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates a significant difference in population
        between the two zip codes, with 02554 (MA) having around 1,000 people and
        11201 (NY) having several thousand or over 40,000 people.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and provides a clear explanation for why 02554

        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 02554 has a "much smaller population
        than 11201", indicating a clear difference in population sizes as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this NO is given as a direct response to
        whether 02554 is more populous than 11201.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that 02554 has a smaller population compared
        to 11201, providing specific reasons for this difference (urban vs. seasonal
        community, population estimates).

        a higher population (over 50,000) than 90210 (CA) (approximately 20,000).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.

        are equal. Instead, it explains that 10011 in New York is likely more populous
        than 90210 in California due to differences in population density and urban
        characteristics.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative result explaining why 90210 is not more populous

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model clearly states that 10003 in New
        York has a higher population (around 44,000) compared to 33139 in Florida
        (estimated at 20,000-25,000). The model explicitly notes this difference in
        population as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by an explanation supporting this conclusion. The model directly
        compares the populations of the two zip codes and determines that 10003 in
        New York has a higher population than 33139 in Florida.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes that 10003, NY has a significantly higher population
        than 33139, FL, estimating 40,000+ residents for 10003 compared to 10,000-20,000
        for 33139.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 33139, FL is more populous than 10003, NY. This is a clear comparative

        Instead, it concludes that 10003, NY has a significantly larger population
        than 33139, FL. The NO answer is based on a difference in population, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that ZIP code 33139 is not more populous than 10003. This is a
        clear comparative result.
