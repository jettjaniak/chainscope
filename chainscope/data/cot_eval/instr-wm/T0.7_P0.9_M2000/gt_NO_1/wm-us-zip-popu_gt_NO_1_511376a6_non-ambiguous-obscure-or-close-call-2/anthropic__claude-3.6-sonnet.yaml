        for Malibu vs. 30,000-35,000 for West Village) and explicitly states that
        West Village is "much more densely populated" than Malibu.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        the basis for its NO answer.

        the population of 90265 (Malibu) is less than the population of 10014 (West
        Village). It explicitly states the different values (12,000 < 31,000) and

        that even at its peak, Nantucket's population doesn't reach that of Brooklyn
        Heights/DUMBO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. In fact, the model states that 89109 has approximately
        28,000 residents while 90028 has approximately 24,000 residents, and it notes
        that 28,000 > 24,000. The NO answer appears to be an error given the data
        presented, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not what
        is logically correct.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 89109, NV is NOT
        more populous than 90028, CA" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

        (around 90,000+) compared to 70116 (around 20,000+). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, directly addressing the question of whether 70116 (LA) is more populous

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that 10024 has "significantly more residents
        than 70112", which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, directly addressing the question of whether 70112 (LA) is more populous
        than 10024 (NY).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d69f63ca-ed83-4834-b8c9-23fec9a90945:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly shows that the populations are different, with
        70112 having approximately 11,000-12,000 residents and 10024 having approximately
        60,000-65,000 residents. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that 70112, LA is not more populous than 10024, NY.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because the
        populations are different (11,000 < 60,000), not because they are equal. The
        model clearly states a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after presenting population figures and comparing them.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it compares the populations and shows that they are different (11,000-12,000
        < 60,000-65,000), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as a comparative result.
