      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, noting that "Broward County is significantly south of Nassau
        County." The NO answer was given because Broward County is south of, not equal
        to, Nassau County.

        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        south"), which is the opposite of equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Nassau
        County is "much further north" than Broward County - it explicitly notes a
