        (Bavaria being west of Luxor), not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in position, with Bavaria
        being "west of Luxor" and Luxor being "significantly east and somewhat south
        of Bavaria".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Bavaria is
        west of Luxor, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        Bavaria is west of Luxor (not east), not because the locations are at the
        same position. In fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        with "Bavaria is west of Luxor" and notes there are several countries between
        them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the relative positions step-by-step.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Luxor is east of Bavaria, indicating a directional difference between their
        positions. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Luxor is east
        of Bavaria, therefore Bavaria is not east of Luxor.

        locations are equal - the model explicitly states that Cairo is west of Java
        and they are separated by several time zones and continents. The NO is due
        to their different positions, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Cairo is located east of Java. The answer is explicit
        and comparative.

        are at the same longitude.

        locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning

        east of Cairo's longitude" and describes them as being in different positions,
        with Java being "far to the east of Africa." The NO is because Cairo is west
        of Java, not because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Cairo is east of Java.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Tuscany being west of Abu Dhabi), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, so
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on directional analysis
        (stating Tuscany is west, not east, of Abu Dhabi)

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Tuscany is west
        of Abu Dhabi (and Abu Dhabi is east of Tuscany), indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Tuscany is located east of Abu Dhabi. The answer is
        given directly and definitively.

        east compared to Tuscany." The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response to whether Tuscany is east of Abu
        Dhabi. The answer is explicit and definitive.

        being equal. The model explicitly states "Greater Orlando is west of Catalonia"
        and provides multiple points showing they are in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        final answer to whether Greater Boston is located east of Transylvania. The
