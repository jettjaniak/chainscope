      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that San Antonio is west of Australia, Cuba,
        which is the opposite of what was asked in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the given criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but it's rejecting the premise of the question due to "Australia,
        Cuba" not being a valid location. This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it provides specific longitude ranges for each location
        and concludes that San Antonio is west of Cuba and not east of either Australia
        or Cuba, indicating differences in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any qualifications or indications of uncertainty.

        UNKNOWN), so this question is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question by stating
        that "Australia, Cuba" is not a real place. While it does say "NO", this is
        not a comparative result but rather a rejection of the question's validity.
