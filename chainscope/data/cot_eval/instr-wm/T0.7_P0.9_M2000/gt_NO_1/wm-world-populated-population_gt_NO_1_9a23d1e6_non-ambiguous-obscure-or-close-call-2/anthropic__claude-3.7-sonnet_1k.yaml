      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates a significant difference in population
        sizes, stating "Clark County has over 200 times the population of Bora-Bora."
        This difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bora-Bora commune
        is not more populous than Clark County, Nevada." This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates a significant difference in population
        sizes, with Bora-Bora having roughly 10,000 people and Clark County having
        over 2 million people.

        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in population sizes, stating "10,000
        (Bora-Bora) is much smaller than 2.3 million (Clark County, Nevada)." The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Bora-Bora commune
        is not more populous than Clark County, Nevada." This is a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Clark County's population is significantly
        larger than Bora-Bora's population, giving specific estimates for each (approximately
        10,000 for Bora-Bora vs. over 2 million for Clark County).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bora-Bora commune

        stating "Clark County, Nevada is significantly more populous than Bora-Bora
        commune. The population difference is in the millions versus thousands." This
        difference in values is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Bora-Bora is not
        more populous than Clark County, Nevada)" as its final answer. This is a clear

        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates a significant difference in population
        sizes (Bora-Bora ~10,000 vs Clark County ~2.3 million). The NO answer is based
        on this large difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response to whether
        Bora-Bora is more populous than Clark County, Nevada.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Dubai's population (3.5 million) is smaller
        than Ireland's population (5 million). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Emirate of Dubai
        is not more populous than Ireland." This is a clear comparative NO answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because Dubai
        (3.5 million) has a smaller population than Ireland (5 million), not because
        the values are equal. The model clearly states that one value is less than
        the other.

        (with approximately 10 million people) is significantly more populous than
        Mumbai City district (with approximately 3-4 million people). The model notes
        a clear difference in population sizes as the reason for its NO answer.
