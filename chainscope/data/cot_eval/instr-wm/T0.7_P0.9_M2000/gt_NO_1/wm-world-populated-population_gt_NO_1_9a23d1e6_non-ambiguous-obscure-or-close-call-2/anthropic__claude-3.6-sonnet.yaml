      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are the same. The model clearly states that Fukushima has 1.8 million
        people while Queens has 2.3 million people, showing a difference in population.
        The NO answer is based on Fukushima having a smaller population than Queens.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that San Antonio is much larger, with about
        50 times the population of Bethlehem.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Bethlehem is not
        more populous than San Antonio)" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
