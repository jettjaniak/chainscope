        equal. Instead, it provides different population figures for Dubai (~3.5 million)
        and Ireland (~5 million), and bases its NO answer on Ireland having a larger
        population. The values are not the same, and the inequality is the reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because Queens
        has a higher population than Fukushima Prefecture, not because the values
        are equal. The model clearly states different population figures for each
        location.
