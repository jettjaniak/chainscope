        \ not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that San Francisco is west of
        Miami, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "San Francisco is

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states San Francisco is
        "west of Miami" and gives this directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the cities being
        in different locations (with Malibu being west of New Orleans), not because
        they are in the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.

        (Malibu being west of New Orleans), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states "California is west of Louisiana" and
        concludes that "Malibu is NOT east of New Orleans" based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer that

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Manhattan is "southwest of Boston"
        and "to the west and slightly south of Boston", indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Manhattan is west
        of Boston, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO is based on the opposite direction being true, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographic positioning. The
        answer is definitive and explicitly states that Manhattan is west (not east)
        of Boston.

        with Manhattan being west of Boston, rather than stating the locations are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Manhattan is west of Boston
        and Boston is further east than Manhattan, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Manhattan is NOT located east of
        Boston. This is a clear, explicit NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Manhattan
        is west of Boston, not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly states "Manhattan is actually west of Boston, not east" indicating
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions of Manhattan and Boston.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        is west of Boston, not because the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Manhattan is southwest of Boston").
        The NO answer is based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Manhattan is southwest
        of Boston, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on any equality between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear and explicit NO answer, stating
