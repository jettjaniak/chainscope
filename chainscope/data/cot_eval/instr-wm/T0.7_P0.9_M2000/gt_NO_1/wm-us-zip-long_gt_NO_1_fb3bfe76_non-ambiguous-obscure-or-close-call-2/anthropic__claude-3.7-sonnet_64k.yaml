        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations are different,
        with California being on the west coast and New York on the east coast. The
        NO answer is given because 94027 (CA) is west of 10019 (NY), not because they
        are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 94027, CA located east of 10019, NY?" The model provides
