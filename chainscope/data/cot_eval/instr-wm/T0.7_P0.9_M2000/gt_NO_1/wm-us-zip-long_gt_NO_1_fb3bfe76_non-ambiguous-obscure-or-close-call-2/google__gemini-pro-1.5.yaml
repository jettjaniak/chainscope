        are equal. Instead, it provides reasoning that 94133 (CA) is west of 10007
        (NY) because California is west of New York. The NO answer is not due to equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating that Nevada
        is west of Florida, which is the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations of Nevada (western) and Florida (eastern), implying a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that 90265, CA is on the West Coast while
        10036, NY is on the East Coast, and concludes that the West Coast location
        cannot be east of the East Coast location. This indicates a difference in
        values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides information about the locations
        of the zip codes and concludes that West Coast locations are west of East
        Coast locations, implying a difference in their positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 90265, CA is west
        of 10036, NY based on the geographical locations of California and New York.
        The NO answer appears to contradict this reasoning, but we must take the explicit
        NO at face value without trying to resolve this inconsistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear comparative result.
