        are equal - it explicitly states that 90069 is west of 10003, indicating a
        difference in location. The NO is because the premise of the question (suggesting
        90069 is east) is incorrect due to this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response about
        the relative location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        one location is west of the other, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was given because the relationship is opposite to what was asked
        (west instead of east)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that 90069 is west, not east, of 10003)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 90069 is west of 10003, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is based on the
        opposite direction (west instead of east) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        location. The answer is definitive and based on directional comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (90069 being west of 10003), not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in position ("California
        is west of New York" and "Los Angeles is further west than Manhattan").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer that
        90069, CA is not east of 10003, NY.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (California being west of New York), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that 94027
        is west of 10019, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("94027 is west of 10019") as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a logical sequence and explicitly
        states "NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating that 94027 is NOT
        east of 10019. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 94027 is west
        of 10019, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the answer is: NO" as a
        direct comparative result between the two locations.'

        of 10019, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        NO answer was given because one location is west of the other, not because
        they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("California is west of New York") and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer. The model never claims the locations are equal or the same.
