      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are the same. It clearly states that The Godfather's runtime (175
        minutes) is greater than Anchorman's runtime (94 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly shows that the runtimes are different (94 minutes vs 175
        minutes) and states that "175 is greater than 94". This difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        It clearly notes a difference in runtime (94 minutes vs 175 minutes) and states
        that "175 minutes is clearly longer than 94 minutes".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly shows that the runtimes are different (94 minutes vs 311
        minutes) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Anchorman (94 minutes) is shorter
        than the Hera Pheri series (311 minutes combined). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in length, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that 94 minutes (Anchorman)
        is less than 311 minutes (Hera Pheri series), indicating a difference in values.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Hera Pheri series is longer
        than Anchorman, with even a single movie from the series being longer than
        Anchorman's runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Anchorman is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. It clearly states that 94 minutes (Anchorman) is less than 311 minutes
        (Hera Pheri series total), indicating a difference in values.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly shows that the values are different (94 minutes
        vs 311 minutes) and states that 94 < 311, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. The model clearly states that Anchorman is 94 minutes
        while the Hera Pheri series is 311 minutes, and concludes that 94 < 311, indicating
        a difference in values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that The Waterboy (90 minutes) is shorter than
        La Grande Vadrouille (132 minutes), noting that "90 is less than 132".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that The Waterboy is shorter than La
        Grande Vadrouille.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
