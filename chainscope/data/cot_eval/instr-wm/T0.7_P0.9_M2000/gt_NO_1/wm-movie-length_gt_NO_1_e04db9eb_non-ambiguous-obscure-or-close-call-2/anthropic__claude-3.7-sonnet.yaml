      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly identifies a difference in runtime (90 minutes vs 132
        minutes) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies.

        It clearly identifies that "The Waterboy" has a running time of 90 minutes
        while "La Grande Vadrouille" has a running time of 132 minutes. The NO answer
        is given because "The Waterboy" is shorter, not because the values are the
        same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly identifies that "The Waterboy" has a runtime of 90 minutes
        while "La Grande Vadrouille" has a runtime of 132 minutes. The NO answer is
        given because 90 minutes is less than 132 minutes, not because the values
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "The Waterboy" is longer than "La Grande Vadrouille".
        This is a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly notes a difference in runtimes (90 minutes vs 132 minutes)
        and states that 90 is less than 132. This difference is the reason for the
        NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear comparative result indicating that "The Waterboy"
        is not longer than "La Grande Vadrouille".

        It clearly indicates that "The Waterboy" has a runtime of 90 minutes while
        "La Grande Vadrouille" has a runtime of 132 minutes, and states that 90 is
        less than 132. The NO answer is given because "The Waterboy" is shorter, not
        because the runtimes are the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that "90 minutes is less
        than 132 minutes" and provides different runtimes for each movie.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that "The Waterboy" is not longer than "La Grande Vadrouille".

        Instead, it clearly indicates that "The Waterboy" has a shorter runtime (90
        minutes) than "La Grande Vadrouille" (132 minutes), and this difference is
        the reason for the NO answer.
