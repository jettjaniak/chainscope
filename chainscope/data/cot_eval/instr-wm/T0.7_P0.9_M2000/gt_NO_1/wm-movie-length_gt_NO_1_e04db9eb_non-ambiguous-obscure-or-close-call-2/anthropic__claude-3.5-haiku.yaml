      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in values (94 vs 175 minutes) and notes that "The Godfather
        is significantly longer." The NO is not due to equal values but due to a clear
        difference in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear reasoning process showing Anchorman
        (94 minutes) is not longer than The Godfather (175 minutes).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    191e999c-33f2-4182-a932-4f496769d4c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted different runtimes (94 vs 175 minutes)
        and stated one was longer than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after determining The Godfather (175 minutes) is longer
        than Anchorman (94 minutes)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that Anchorman (94 minutes) is shorter than The Godfather (175 minutes). The
        NO is based on this difference in values, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific runtime values
        and making a direct comparison showing Anchorman is shorter than The Godfather.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Anchorman
        (94 minutes) is less than The Godfather (175 minutes), not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly shows the inequality with "94 minutes (Anchorman)
        < 175 minutes (The Godfather)"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the runtimes of the two movies (94 min vs 175
        min)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a significant difference between the runtimes (94 vs 175 minutes)
        rather than stating they are equal. The NO is because The Godfather is longer,
        not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the runtimes and finding The Godfather to be
        significantly longer than Anchorman.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states "The Hera Pheri series is significantly longer
        than Anchorman" and provides specific different runtimes (95 minutes vs 469
        minutes). The NO answer is based on Hera Pheri being longer, not on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Adam McKay's
        Anchorman is NOT longer than Priyadarshan's Hera Pheri series." This is a
        clear NO comparative answer.

        stated to be different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that The Hobbit trilogy is significantly longer than Deathly Hallows. This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in runtime (150 minutes vs 144 minutes) and indicates
        that Muqaddar Ka Sikandar is "slightly longer." The NO is not due to equal
        values but due to one being longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Chhichhore is NOT longer than Muqaddar Ka Sikandar."

        not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies, where it found that Gangs
        of Wasseypur (313 minutes) is longer than Don (175 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the movies have equal runtimes.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that "Gangs of Wasseypur is significantly longer
        than the original Don" and provides different runtimes (175 minutes vs 320
        minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Chandra Barot's Don
        is NOT longer than Anurag Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (175 minutes
        vs 282 minutes) and states that "282 minutes is longer than 175 minutes" as
        the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal, and inequality is
        the basis for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Chandra Barot's Don
        is NOT longer than Anurag Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur" as its final comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant difference ("Gangs
        of Wasseypur is significantly longer than the original Don") and showed different
        runtimes (170 vs 313 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated there was a 42-minute difference
        between the runtimes, with La Grande Vadrouille being longer than The Waterboy.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (90 minutes
        vs 132 minutes) and indicates that La Grande Vadrouille is longer. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether The Waterboy
        is longer than La Grande Vadrouille.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that the runtimes are different (90 vs 132
        minutes) and states "132 is longer than 90". The NO answer appears to be based
        on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (90 vs 132 minutes) and stated that one was less than the other.
        The NO was given because one value was smaller, not because they were equal.
