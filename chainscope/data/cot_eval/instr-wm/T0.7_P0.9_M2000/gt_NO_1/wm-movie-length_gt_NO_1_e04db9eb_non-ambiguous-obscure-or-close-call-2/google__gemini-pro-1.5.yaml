      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it suggests that the Hera Pheri series, being multiple
        movies, would have a longer combined runtime than the single Anchorman movie.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the runtimes are equal.
        Instead, it suggests that it's highly unlikely for one movie's runtime to
        be longer than the combined runtime of several movies. This is not a statement
        of equality, but rather a comparison indicating a difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it suggests that the combined runtime of the Hera Pheri
        series is likely longer than Anchorman, which implies a difference in values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it suggests that the combined runtime of a series will
        inherently be longer than a single movie, which is a difference in values
        and the reason for the NO answer.

        is NO" as its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly shows that the lengths are different (94 minutes
        for Anchorman vs. 300 minutes for the Hera Pheri series) and uses this difference
        as the basis for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the runtimes are equal
        or the same. Instead, it implies that the runtime of a single movie (Anchorman)
        is likely shorter than the combined runtime of multiple movies (Hera Pheri
        series). This difference in values is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is almost certainly NO." at the end of its response. This is a clear comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Anchorman's length (94 minutes)
        is much less than the Hera Pheri series length (at least 6 hours or 360 minutes).
        The NO answer is given because of this difference, not because of equality.

        In fact, it explicitly mentions that "The Hobbit films are individually and

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. The model calculates different total runtimes (276 minutes
        for Deathly Hallows vs 474 minutes for The Hobbit) and states that 474 > 276,

        In fact, it explicitly states that "the combined runtimes of the three Hobbit
        movies are significantly longer than the two Deathly Hallows movies". This
        difference in length is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "my answer is likely NO",
        which is a clear comparative result, even though it's prefaced with "assuming

        Hobbit (474 minutes) is greater than the total runtime of Deathly Hallows
        (276 minutes).

        the values are equal. The model clearly shows that the runtimes are different
        (276 minutes vs 474 minutes) and the NO is because the Hobbit trilogy has
        a longer runtime than the two Deathly Hallows movies.

        after comparing the runtimes.
