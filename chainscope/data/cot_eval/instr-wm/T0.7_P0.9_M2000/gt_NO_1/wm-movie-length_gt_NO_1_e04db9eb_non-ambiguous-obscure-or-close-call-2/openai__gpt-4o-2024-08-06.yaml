      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because "Anchorman"
        (94 minutes) is shorter than "The Godfather" (175 minutes), not because the
        values are equal. The model clearly states different runtimes for the two
        movies.

        It clearly indicates that "Anchorman" has a runtime of 94 minutes while "The
        Godfather" has a runtime of 175 minutes, and concludes that "Anchorman" is
        shorter than "The Godfather".

        Instead, it clearly indicates that "The Waterboy" has a runtime of 90 minutes,
        which is less than the 132 minutes runtime of "La Grande Vadrouille". The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." as its final conclusion after comparing the runtimes of the two movies.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that The Waterboy (90 minutes) is shorter than
        La Grande Vadrouille (132 minutes), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, directly addressing the question of whether The Waterboy is longer
        than La Grande Vadrouille.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        It clearly indicates that "The Waterboy" has a runtime of 90 minutes while
        "La Grande Vadrouille" has a runtime of 132 minutes, and it's this difference
        that leads to the NO answer.
