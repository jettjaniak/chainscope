        are equal. Instead, it notes that the shortest film in the Hera Pheri series
        (143 minutes) is longer than Anchorman (98 minutes). This difference in length
        is the reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly shows that Anchorman (98 minutes) is much shorter than
        the combined length of the Hera Pheri series (296 minutes). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this comparison,
        the answer to whether Adam McKay's Anchorman is longer than Priyadarshan's

        Instead, it compares the longest "Anchorman" film (119 minutes) with the longest
        "Hera Pheri" film (156 minutes) and concludes that "Hera Pheri" is longer.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        than Anchorman, stating "Given that at least one film in Priyadarshan's Hera
        Pheri series is longer than Adam McKay's Anchorman". The NO answer is based
        on this difference in length, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it clearly indicates a difference in runtime (90 minutes
        vs 132 minutes) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.

        answer to whether The Waterboy is longer than La Grande Vadrouille. This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        It clearly indicates that "The Waterboy" is 90 minutes long while "La Grande
        Vadrouille" is 132 minutes long, and concludes that "The Waterboy" is shorter
        than "La Grande Vadrouille". The NO answer is based on this difference in
        length, not on equality.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that the runtimes are different (90 minutes
        vs 132 minutes) and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer.
