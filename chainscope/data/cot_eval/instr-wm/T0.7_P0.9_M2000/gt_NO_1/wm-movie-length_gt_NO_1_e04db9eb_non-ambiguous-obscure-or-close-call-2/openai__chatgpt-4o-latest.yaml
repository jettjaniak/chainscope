        Instead, it clearly indicates that 94 minutes (Anchorman) is significantly
        shorter than 175 minutes (The Godfather), which is the reason for the NO answer.

        Instead, it calculates different total runtimes for each series (213 minutes
        for Anchorman and 298 minutes for Hera Pheri) and concludes that the Hera

        It clearly indicates that Anchorman is 94 minutes long while Hera Pheri is
        145 minutes long, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.

        are equal. It clearly shows that Anchorman has a runtime of 94 minutes while
        the Hera Pheri series has a total runtime of 298 minutes. The NO answer is
        given because Anchorman is shorter, not because the values are the same.

        It clearly indicates that "Anchorman" has a runtime of 94 minutes while "Hera

        are equal. Instead, it clearly shows that the Hera Pheri series (300 minutes)
        is longer than the Anchorman series (213 minutes). The NO answer is given
        because Anchorman is shorter, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Anchorman (or its series) is
        shorter than the Hera Pheri series in both interpretations it considers. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
