      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that there is a significant difference
        in runtime between the two movies (94 minutes for Anchorman vs. 175 minutes
        for The Godfather).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and provides a clear explanation for why Anchorman
        is not longer than The Godfather.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values being compared are the same. The model clearly states that the
        Anchorman series has a total runtime of 213 minutes, while the Hera Pheri
        series has a total runtime of 316 minutes. The NO answer is given because
        213 minutes is less than 316 minutes, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear and direct response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the given criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It explores multiple interpretations of the question
        and presents various scenarios, but ultimately does not commit to a single
        definitive answer. The response ends with considering different possibilities
        without settling on one.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model does give a NO answer, it is not because
        the values being compared are the same. The model clearly states that The
        Hobbit trilogy has a longer total runtime (474 minutes) compared to Deathly
        Hallows (276 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference in runtime,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result between the runtimes of the two film
        series. This NO is based on the total runtime comparison (276 minutes for
        Deathly Hallows vs 474 minutes for The Hobbit) as well as individual film
        comparisons.

    6e5b97f2-a4fc-43f0-acda-8ef9a058f1eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. It clearly states that The Waterboy has a runtime
        of 90 minutes while La Grande Vadrouille has a runtime of 132 minutes, and
        this difference in runtime is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, both in the conclusion of its thought process and in the final "Answer:"
        line.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly states different runtimes for the two movies (90 minutes
        for The Waterboy and 132 minutes for La Grande Vadrouille) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. It clearly states that The Waterboy has a runtime of
        90 minutes while La Grande Vadrouille runs for 132 minutes, showing a difference
        in values. The NO answer is given because The Waterboy is shorter, not equal
        in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this is supported by its reasoning that The
        Waterboy (90 minutes) is shorter than La Grande Vadrouille (132 minutes).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. The model states that "La Grande Vadrouille" has a runtime
        of 132 minutes while "The Waterboy" has a runtime of 90 minutes, which are
        different values. The NO answer is given because "La Grande Vadrouille" is
        longer than "The Waterboy", not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because it found
        The Waterboy (89 minutes) to be shorter than La Grande Vadrouille (132 minutes),
        not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are the same. It clearly states different runtimes for the two
        movies (89 minutes vs 132 minutes) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, based on its conclusion that La Grande Vadrouille (132 minutes) is
        longer than The Waterboy (89 minutes).
