      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that "Anchorman" has a shorter runtime
        (94 minutes) compared to "The Godfather" (175 minutes), and this difference
        in runtime is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as a clear comparative result to the question of whether "Anchorman"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in runtimes (90 minutes for "The
        Waterboy" and 132 minutes for "La Grande Vadrouille") and bases its NO answer
        on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that "The Waterboy" is NOT longer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that "The Waterboy" has a runtime of 90 minutes
        while "La Grande Vadrouille" has a runtime of 132 minutes, and concludes that
        "The Waterboy" is shorter than "La Grande Vadrouille".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the runtimes of both films.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. It clearly states that "The Waterboy" (90 minutes) is
        shorter than "La Grande Vadrouille" (132 minutes), indicating a difference
        in values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that the runtimes are different (90 minutes
        for "The Waterboy" and 132 minutes for "La Grande Vadrouille") and states
        that 90 minutes is less than 132 minutes. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response to whether
        "The Waterboy" is longer than "La Grande Vadrouille".

        Instead, it clearly indicates that "The Waterboy" has a runtime of 90 minutes
        while "La Grande Vadrouille" has a runtime of 132 minutes. The NO answer is
        given because "The Waterboy" is shorter, not because the runtimes are the
        same.

        It clearly indicates that "The Waterboy" is shorter than "La Grande Vadrouille"
        by about 42 minutes, which is the reason for the NO answer.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that "The Waterboy" has a shorter runtime (90
        minutes) compared to "La Grande Vadrouille" (132 minutes). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in runtime, not on equality.
