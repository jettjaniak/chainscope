      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it is not because
        the values being compared are the same. The model clearly states that Anchorman
        is 94 minutes long while the Hera Pheri series is 309 minutes long. The NO
        answer is given because 94 minutes is less than 309 minutes, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer. The response concludes with "Therefore, the answer is: No." after
        comparing the runtimes of Anchorman (94 minutes) and the Hera Pheri series
        (309 minutes).'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. It clearly states that Anchorman's runtime (94
        minutes) is shorter than both possible interpretations of the Hera Pheri series
        (156 or 311 minutes). The NO answer is based on Anchorman being shorter, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        comparing the runtime of Anchorman (94 minutes) to both interpretations of
        the Hera Pheri series (156 minutes for just the first film, or 311 minutes
        for both films). The model is clear and confident in its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Gangs of Wasseypur
        is longer than Don, with Don being approximately 175 minutes and Gangs of
        Wasseypur being approximately 319 minutes when both parts are combined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Chandra Barot's Don longer than Anurag Kashyap's Gangs
        of Wasseypur?" The model provides a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Gangs of Wasseypur
        (319 minutes) is longer than Don (175 minutes). The NO answer is given because
        Don is shorter, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response to whether
        Don is longer than Gangs of Wasseypur.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that "The Waterboy" has a runtime of 90 minutes
        while "La Grande Vadrouille" has a runtime of 132 minutes, and it concludes
        that "The Waterboy" is shorter by about 42 minutes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "The Waterboy"
        has a runtime of 90 minutes, which is less than "La Grande Vadrouille's" 132
        minutes. The NO answer is based on this difference in runtimes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. It clearly concludes that "The Waterboy" is not
        longer than "La Grande Vadrouille" based on their runtimes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in runtime, with "The Waterboy"
        being 90 minutes and "La Grande Vadrouille" being 132 minutes. The NO answer
        is given because "The Waterboy" is shorter, not because the runtimes are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer. The response concludes with "NO" after explaining that "The Waterboy"
        is shorter than "La Grande Vadrouille".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that "La Grande Vadrouille (132 minutes) is
        considerably longer than The Waterboy (90 minutes)", which is the reason for
        the NO answer.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that "The Waterboy" is shorter (90 minutes)
        than "La Grande Vadrouille" (132 minutes). The NO answer is given because
        of this difference in length, not because the values are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that "La Grande Vadrouille" is longer than "The
        Waterboy" by about 42 minutes, and describes "La Grande Vadrouille" as "significantly
        longer".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its reasoning, providing a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are the same. It clearly states that "The Waterboy" is shorter
        than "La Grande Vadrouille" by about 42 minutes, indicating a significant
        difference in running times.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it clearly indicates that the runtimes are different (90 minutes
        for "The Waterboy" and 132 minutes for "La Grande Vadrouille"). The NO answer
        is given because "The Waterboy" is shorter, not because the runtimes are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct result of comparing
