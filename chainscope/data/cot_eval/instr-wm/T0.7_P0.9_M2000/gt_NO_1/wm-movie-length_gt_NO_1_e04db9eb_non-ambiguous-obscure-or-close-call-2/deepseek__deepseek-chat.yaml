      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because it found
        that The Waterboy (90 minutes) is shorter than La Grande Vadrouille (132 minutes),
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question asked.
      final_answer: 'NO'
