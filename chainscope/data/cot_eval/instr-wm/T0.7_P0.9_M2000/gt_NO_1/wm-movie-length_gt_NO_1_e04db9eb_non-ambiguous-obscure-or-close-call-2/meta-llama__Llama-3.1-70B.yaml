        has a runtime of 132 minutes, which is less than the total runtime of 348
        minutes for the "Fifty Shades" series. The difference in runtimes is the reason

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it clearly indicates that the runtimes are different
        (90 minutes vs 132 minutes) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as the final comparative
        answer to whether "The Waterboy" is longer than "La Grande Vadrouille". This
        is based on the runtime comparison where "The Waterboy" (90 minutes) is less
        than "La Grande Vadrouille" (132 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's because
        "La Grande Vadrouille" (132 minutes) is longer than "The Waterboy" (90 minutes),
        not because the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in runtime, with "The Waterboy"
        being 90 minutes long and "La Grande Vadrouille" being 132 minutes long. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in runtime, with "The Waterboy"
        being 90 minutes long and "La Grande Vadrouille" being 132 minutes long. The
        NO answer is given because "The Waterboy" is shorter, not because the runtimes
        are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that "The Waterboy" has a runtime of 90 minutes,
        which is less than the 132 minutes runtime of "La Grande Vadrouille". The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as the final comparative
        answer to whether "The Waterboy" is longer than "La Grande Vadrouille". This
        is a clear and direct answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that "The Waterboy" is shorter than "La Grande
        Vadrouille", with specific different runtimes given (90 minutes vs 132 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "The Waterboy" is longer than "La Grande Vadrouille". This is a
