      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that Manhattan has a "significantly higher
        population density than Malibu, CA." This indicates a clear difference in
        values, not equality.

        answer to whether Malibu, CA is more densely populated than Manhattan, NY.
