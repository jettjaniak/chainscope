      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Manhattan's density is significantly
        higher than Malibu's, stating it is "more than 100 times greater." This difference
        in values is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Malibu is not more
        densely populated than Manhattan." This is a clear comparative NO answer to
        the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates a significant difference, stating
        that "Manhattan's population density (70,000/sq mi) is more than 100 times
        greater than Malibu's (650/sq mi)." This difference is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Malibu is not more
        densely populated than Manhattan." This is a clear and direct comparative
        answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculates and compares different density
        values for Manhattan (70,000 people per square mile) and Malibu (600 people
        per square mile), noting that "Manhattan's population density is more than
        100 times greater than Malibu's".

        differ greatly (over 70,000 people per square mile for Manhattan vs. less
        than 1,000 people per square mile for Malibu).
