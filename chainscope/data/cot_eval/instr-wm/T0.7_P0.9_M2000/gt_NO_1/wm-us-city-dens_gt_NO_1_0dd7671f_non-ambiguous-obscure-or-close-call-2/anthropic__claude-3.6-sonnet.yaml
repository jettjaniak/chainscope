      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Queens is much more densely populated than
        Austin, with a significant difference in population density (21,000 vs 3,100
        people per square mile).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Austin is not more densely populated than Queens.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Queens has a much higher population density
        than Austin, which is the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it clearly shows that the population densities are different, with
        Queens being about 6 times more densely populated than Austin. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Austin is not more
        densely populated than Queens, NY." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Queens is significantly more densely populated
        than Austin, stating "Queens is significantly more densely populated than
        Austin - by about 6.7 times."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Austin, TX is not
        more densely populated than Queens, NY." at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Queens is about 7 times more densely populated
        than Austin, showing a significant difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Austin is not more

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it clearly shows that the densities are different, with Queens being
        about 6 times more densely populated than Austin. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Austin is not more
        densely populated than Queens)" as its final answer. This is a clear comparative
        NO response.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Queens has a significantly higher population
        density (21,000) compared to Austin (3,100).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        In fact, it clearly shows that Los Angeles has a higher population density
        (8,300 people per square mile) compared to Atlanta (3,650 people per square
        mile). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Atlanta is not more

        Instead, it calculates different population densities for Atlanta (~3,650
        people/sq mile) and Los Angeles (~7,950 people/sq mile), and explicitly states
        that Los Angeles is "clearly more dense than" Atlanta.
