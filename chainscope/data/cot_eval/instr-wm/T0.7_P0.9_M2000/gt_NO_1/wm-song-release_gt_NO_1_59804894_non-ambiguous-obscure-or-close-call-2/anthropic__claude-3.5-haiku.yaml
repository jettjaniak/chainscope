      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that 1965 is earlier than 1987 and "My Generation"
        was released BEFORE "Sweet Child o' Mine". The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making this an explicit NO response to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in dates (1965 vs 1987) and that The Who's song "was released earlier." The
        NO is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether The Who's
        song was released later than Guns N' Roses's song.

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1985 is earlier than
        1998 and uses this difference to conclude NO. The values are different, not
        the same.

        than 2017, indicating a difference between the dates. The NO is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs, determining that 1997
        is earlier than 2017.

        predates "Scared to Be Lonely", showing a clear temporal difference between
        the releases (1974/1997 vs 2017). The NO appears to contradict the reasoning
        given, but we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated without resolving
        contradictions.

        answer, with a clear explanation showing that 2004 is earlier than 2014, not
        later.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date was earlier
        than the other (1967 is earlier than 2016). The NO was given because Sgt.
        Pepper's was released earlier, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the dates
        it identified (1967 vs 2016). The answer is definitive and matches the format
        of providing a clear comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the dates were equal. The model explicitly showed that the dates were different
        (2013 vs 2020) and gave NO because 2013 is earlier than 2020, not because
        they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" answer to whether Lorde's "Team"
        was released later than BTS's "On". The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        It explicitly states that one song was "EARLIER" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        the release dates, indicating a clear negative comparative answer. The model
        showed its reasoning that Yellow Submarine (1966) was released before Sundown
        (1974).

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different years (2005
        vs 2008) and stated that "2008 is later than 2005" as the reason for its answer.
        The NO was based on a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Gold Digger was NOT released later
        than Disturbia. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

        that the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted a difference in the
        dates (2005 vs 2008). The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own
        reasoning, but we must evaluate only what was stated, not resolve contradictions.
        Since the model showed different values and did not cite equality as the reason
        for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model gives contradictory answers - first saying
        "YES" in the detailed explanation but ending with "NO" as the final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2000 is earlier
        than 2007, showing a clear difference between the dates. The NO is based on
        this difference (2000 being before 2007), not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Yellow was
        released later than Good Life. The answer is definitive and based on comparing
