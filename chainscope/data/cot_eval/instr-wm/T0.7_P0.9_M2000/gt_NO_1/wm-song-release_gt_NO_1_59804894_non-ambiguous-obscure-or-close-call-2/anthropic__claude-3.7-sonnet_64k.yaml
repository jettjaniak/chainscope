      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the songs were released
        in different years (1965 vs 1987) and bases its NO answer on "My Generation"
        being released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "My Generation" was released later than "Sweet Child o' Mine".
        This is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "My Generation" was
        released in 1965, which is approximately 23 years EARLIER than "Sweet Child
        o' Mine" (1988). The model notes a significant difference in the release dates,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response to whether
        "My Generation" was released later than "Sweet Child o' Mine".

        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the songs were released
        in different years (1965 vs. 1988) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies different release years (1965
        vs 1988) and states that there is a 23-year difference between them. The NO
        answer is based on "My Generation" being released BEFORE "Sweet Child o' Mine",
        not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was The Who's My Generation released later than Guns N' Roses's
        Sweet Child o' Mine?" The model provides a clear comparative result based
        on the release dates it identified.

        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in release dates, stating that
        "My Generation" was released about 23 years earlier than "Sweet Child o' Mine".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, directly addressing the question of whether "My Generation" was released

        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that "My Generation" was released
        in 1965 and "Sweet Child o' Mine" was released in 1988, with a gap of about
        23 years between them. The NO answer is given because "My Generation" was
        released earlier, not because the dates are the same.

        was released approximately 26 years before "Poison".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct result of comparing

        in release dates, with "Pompeii" being released in 2013 and "Beautiful Crazy"
        in 2018, about 5 years apart. The NO answer is given because "Pompeii" was
        released earlier, not because the dates are equal.

        for Chicago's song and 1987 for Bon Jovi's song) and uses this difference
        to justify its NO answer. The NO is because Chicago's song was released earlier,
        not because the dates are the same.

        compared are the same. The model clearly states that there is a significant
        time difference (28 years) between the release dates, with Selena Gomez's
        song being released later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, directly addressing the question of whether Whitney Houston's song
        was released later than Selena Gomez's song.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the songs were released in
        different years (1985 vs 2013) and uses this difference as the basis for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Whitney Houston's "How Will I Know" was not released
        later than Selena Gomez's "Come & Get It".
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Whitney Houston's
        song was released about 28 years EARLIER than Selena Gomez's song, indicating
        a significant difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response to whether
        Whitney Houston's song was released later than Selena Gomez's song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. It clearly states that Whitney Houston's song was released
        earlier (1985) than Selena Gomez's song (2013), which is the reason for the
        NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "Rocket Man"
        was released in 1972 and "Islands in the Stream" was released in 1983, and
        concludes that "Rocket Man" was released earlier, not later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct response to whether
        Elton John's "Rocket Man" was released later than Dolly Parton's "Islands
        in the Stream".

        1972 and "Islands in the Stream" was released in 1983, and that 1972 comes
        before 1983. The NO answer is because "Rocket Man" was released earlier, not
        later, than "Islands in the Stream".
