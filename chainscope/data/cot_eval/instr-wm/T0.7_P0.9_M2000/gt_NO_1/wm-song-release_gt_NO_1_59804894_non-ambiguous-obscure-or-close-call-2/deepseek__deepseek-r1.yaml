      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. It clearly states that "The Prayer" was released in
        1998 and "Pillowtalk" in 2016, indicating a difference in release dates. The
        NO answer is given because "The Prayer" was released earlier, not because
        the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and provides a clear explanation for why "The
        Prayer" was not released later than "Pillowtalk".

        difference of nearly three years between the release dates. The NO is because
        Elle King's song predates Cardi B's song, not because they were released at
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is clearly given as a direct response

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. The model clearly states that "Sunday Bloody Sunday"
        was released in 1983, while "The Final Countdown" was released in 1986. The
        model explicitly notes this difference in years as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct response to the comparative question. The model clearly
        concludes that "Sunday Bloody Sunday" was released earlier, not later, than
        "The Final Countdown".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it clearly identifies different release dates for the
        two songs (March 1983 for "Sunday Bloody Sunday" and February 1986 for "The
        Final Countdown"). The NO answer is given because the first song was released
        earlier, not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but it's not
        because the values are equal. The model clearly states that U2's song was
        released in 1983, which is earlier than Europe's song released in 1986. The
        NO answer is given because U2's song was released earlier, not because the
        dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative result.'

        Sunday" was released in 1983, which is earlier than "The Final Countdown"
        released in 1986. The NO answer is given because of this difference in release
        years, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct result of comparing
        the release dates of the two songs.

        years (1967 for "I Am the Walrus" and 1978 for "Rasputin"). The NO answer
        is given because 1967 precedes 1978, not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. It clearly concludes that "I Am the Walrus" was
        not released later than "Rasputin" based on the release dates it determined
        (1967 vs 1978).

        was released in 1985 or 1986, while Selena Gomez's song was released in 2013.
        The NO answer is given because 1985/1986 is earlier than 2013, not because
        the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct result of comparing
        the release dates of the two songs.
