      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "My Generation"
        was released in 1965 and "Sweet Child o' Mine" was released in 1987, and concludes
        that "My Generation" was released earlier, not later, than "Sweet Child o'
        Mine."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that "Mr. Jones" was released
        in 1993 and "Walk It Talk It" was released in 2018, which are different years.
        The NO answer is based on "Mr. Jones" being released earlier, not on the dates
        being the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly identifies different release dates (1993
        for "Mr. Jones" and 2018 for "Walk It Talk It") and bases its NO answer on
        "Mr. Jones" being released earlier, not later than "Walk It Talk It."

        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "Mr. Jones" was
        released in 1993 and "Walk It Talk It" was released in 2018, indicating a
        difference in release dates. The NO answer is given because "Mr. Jones" was

        compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "Mr. Jones" was released
        approximately 25 years earlier than "Walk It Talk It," indicating a significant
        difference in release dates.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly identifies different release years (1989
        vs 2011) and states that one is earlier than the other.

        released in 2006 and Justin Timberlake's song was released in 2013, indicating
        a difference of 7 years. The NO answer is given because Ne-Yo's song was released

        Diana Ross's song was released in 1980 and Halsey's song in 2018, indicating
        a difference in release dates. The NO answer is given because Diana Ross's
        song was released earlier, not later, than Halsey's.

        Out" was released in 2000, which is earlier than "Hollaback Girl" released
        in 2005. The NO answer is given because the question presumably asked if the
        first song was released later, which the model determined to be false.

        "Islands in the Stream" was released in 1983, and that 1972 comes before 1983.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
