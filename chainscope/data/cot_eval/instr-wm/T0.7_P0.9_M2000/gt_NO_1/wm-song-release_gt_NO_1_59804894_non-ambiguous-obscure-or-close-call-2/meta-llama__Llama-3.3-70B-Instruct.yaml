      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that "My Generation" was released in 1965
        and "Sweet Child o' Mine" was released in 1987, and the NO answer is based
        on 1965 being earlier than 1987.

        and 1987) and states that 1965 is earlier than 1987, which is the reason for
        the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the songs were released
        in different years (1985 and 2013) and uses this difference to justify its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        in 1972 and "Islands in the Stream" in 1983, with 1972 being before 1983.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in release years, not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to whether 'Rocket Man' was released later than 'Islands in the Stream' is
        NO." This is a clear and direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        earlier (1972) than "Islands in the Stream" (1983), which is the reason for

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but it's not
        because the values are equal. The model clearly states that "Rocket Man" was
        released in 1972 and "Islands in the Stream" was released in 1983, indicating
        different release years. The NO answer is given because "Rocket Man" was released
        before "Islands in the Stream", not because they were released at the same
        time.
