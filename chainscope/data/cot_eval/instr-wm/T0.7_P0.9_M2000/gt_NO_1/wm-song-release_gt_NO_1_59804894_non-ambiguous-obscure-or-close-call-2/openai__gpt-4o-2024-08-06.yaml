      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the release dates are different
        (1972 vs 1983) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that 1972 is earlier than
        1983, indicating a difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, directly addressing the question of whether "Rocket Man" was released
        later than "Islands in the Stream".
