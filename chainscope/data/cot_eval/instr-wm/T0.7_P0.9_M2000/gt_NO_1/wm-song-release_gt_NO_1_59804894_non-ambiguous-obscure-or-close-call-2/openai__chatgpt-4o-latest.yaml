      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "My Generation" was
        released in 1965, which is earlier than "Sweet Child o' Mine" released in
        1987/1988. The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but it's not
        because the values are equal. The model clearly states that 1984 is earlier
        than 1986, indicating a difference in the release years.

        because the values are equal. The model clearly states that the songs were
        released in different years (1975 vs 2005) and determines that 2005 is later
        than 1975.
