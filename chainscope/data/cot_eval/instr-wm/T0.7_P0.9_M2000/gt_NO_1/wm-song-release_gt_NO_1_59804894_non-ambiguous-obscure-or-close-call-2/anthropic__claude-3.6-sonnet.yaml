      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. It clearly states that "My Generation" was released
        in 1965 and "Sweet Child o' Mine" in 1987, and concludes that 1965 comes before
        1987.

        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that one song was released
        earlier than the other, indicating a difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, directly addressing the question asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the release dates are different
        (1965 vs 1987) and that "My Generation" was released earlier than "Sweet Child
        o' Mine".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as a clear comparative result.

        the NO answer.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that "My Generation" was released

        in years as the basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that "My Generation" was released in 1965 and
        "Sweet Child o' Mine" was released in 1987, with 1965 coming before 1987.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that "My Generation" was released
        earlier (1965) than "Sweet Child o' Mine" (1987). The NO answer is given because
        the question presumably asked if "My Generation" was released later, which
        the model refutes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the songs were released
        in different years (1963 and 1989) and bases its NO answer on the fact that
        1963 is earlier than 1989.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "Rack City" was released
        later than "Wannabe", indicating a difference in release dates.
