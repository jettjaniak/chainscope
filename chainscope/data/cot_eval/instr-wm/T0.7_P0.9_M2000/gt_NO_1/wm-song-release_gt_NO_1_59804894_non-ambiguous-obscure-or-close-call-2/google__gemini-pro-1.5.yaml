      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it clearly indicates that the dates are different (1965
        vs 1987) and that My Generation was released before Sweet Child o' Mine. The
        NO answer appears to be inconsistent with the reasoning provided, but we must
        evaluate based solely on what was stated, not logical consistency.
