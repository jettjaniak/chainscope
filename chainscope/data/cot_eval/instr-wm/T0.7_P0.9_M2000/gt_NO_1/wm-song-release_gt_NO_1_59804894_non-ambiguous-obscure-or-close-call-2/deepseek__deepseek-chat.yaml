      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model's reasoning clearly states
        that the release dates are different (1964 vs 1992). The NO answer contradicts
        the reasoning, but we're instructed to analyze only what was explicitly stated,
        not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is inconsistent with its
        step-by-step reasoning. While the reasoning concludes with "Yes", the final
        answer explicitly states "NO." As per the instructions, we should base our
        classification on what was explicitly stated as the final answer, even if
        illogical.

        UNKNOWN due to contradiction), so this must be False regardless of the content
        of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory. The step-by-step
        reasoning concludes with "Yes", but the final answer states "NO". Given this
        contradiction and the lack of a clear YES/NO answer, we must classify this

        different years (1984 vs 1989) and concludes that "Panama" was released earlier
        than "Janie's Got a Gun". The NO answer is not due to equal values, but because
        the comparison shows "Panama" was released earlier, not later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Van Halen's "Panama" was released later than Aerosmith's

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that "Rocket Man" was released
        earlier (1972) than "Islands in the Stream" (1983), and this difference in
        release dates is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that "Rocket Man" was released
        earlier than "Islands in the Stream", showing a difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO." at
        the end of its response, providing a clear comparative result.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, so according to the instructions,
        this must be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        followed by a clear comparative statement confirming that Rocket Man was released
        earlier than Islands in the Stream.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d321e2e2-8f5b-4def-9399-d5989aca0782:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that the songs were released in different years
        (1972 vs 1983) and uses this difference to justify the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Elton John's Rocket
        Man was not released later than Dolly Parton's Islands in the Stream." This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "Rocket Man"
        was released earlier (April 1972) than "Islands in the Stream" (August 1983).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "Rocket Man" was released later than "Islands in
        the Stream".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
