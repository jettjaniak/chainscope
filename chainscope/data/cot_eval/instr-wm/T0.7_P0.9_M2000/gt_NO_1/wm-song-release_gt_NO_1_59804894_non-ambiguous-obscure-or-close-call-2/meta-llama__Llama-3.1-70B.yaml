      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the songs were released
        in different years (1965 vs 1987) and uses this difference to justify its
        NO answer.

        was released in 1965 and "Sweet Child o' Mine" was released in 1987, indicating
        a difference in release dates. The NO answer is given because "My Generation"
        was released earlier, not because the dates are equal.
