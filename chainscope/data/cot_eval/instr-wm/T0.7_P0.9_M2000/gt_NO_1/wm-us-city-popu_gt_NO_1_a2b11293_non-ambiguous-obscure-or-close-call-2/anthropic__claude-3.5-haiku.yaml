        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case anyway)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different values (1.4M vs 1.3M), not equal ones.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also explicitly stated to
        be different (1.4M vs 1.3M), not equal

    6fdd8c6a-1fe8-48fd-bd35-9e26ec398a34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Dallas (1.3 million)
        is "significantly larger than" the Bronx (408,000). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer in step 4.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant difference, noting
        "Dallas is significantly more populous than the Bronx" and "Dallas has over
        3 times the population of the Bronx".
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
