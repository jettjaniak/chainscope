      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Compton has a
        smaller population (around 95,000) compared to Orlando (exceeding 280,000).
        The difference in population sizes is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response to whether
        Compton has a larger population than Orlando.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it provides specific population estimates (Orlando around
        307,000, Compton around 95,000) and concludes that Orlando is significantly
        more populous than Compton. The NO answer is based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Compton, CA is more populous than Orlando, FL. This is a clear
        comparative result.

        The difference in population is the reason for the NO answer, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Portland, Oregon is more populous than Seattle,
        Washington. This NO is given as a direct comparative result.
