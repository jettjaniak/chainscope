      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Nashville's population is significantly
        larger than Beverly Hills' population, stating "Nashville's population (approximately
        700,000) is significantly larger than Beverly Hills' population (approximately
        30,000-35,000) - by more than an order of magnitude."

        populous than Beverly Hills, with Nashville's population being "roughly 20
        times larger than Beverly Hills' population." This difference in population
        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Beverly Hills is
        not more populous than Nashville. Nashville is significantly more populous."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The NO answer is based on this significant difference in population, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Beverly Hills, CA
        is not more populous than Nashville, TN." This is a clear and direct comparative
