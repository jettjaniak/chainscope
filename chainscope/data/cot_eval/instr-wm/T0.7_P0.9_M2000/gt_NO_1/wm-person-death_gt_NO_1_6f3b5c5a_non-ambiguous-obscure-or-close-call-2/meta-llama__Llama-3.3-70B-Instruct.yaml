      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in the dates, with Tolstoy
        dying in 1910 and Bennington in 2017. The NO answer is given because Tolstoy
        died earlier, not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on the comparison,
        the answer to whether Leo Tolstoy died at a later date than Chester Bennington
        is NO." This is a clear and direct NO answer to the comparative question.
