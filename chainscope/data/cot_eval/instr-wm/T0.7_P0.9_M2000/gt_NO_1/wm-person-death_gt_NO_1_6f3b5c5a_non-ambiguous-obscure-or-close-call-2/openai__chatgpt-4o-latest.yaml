        Instead, it clearly identifies different death dates (1910 for Tolstoy and

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Stalin died in
        1953 while Himmler died in 1945, and concludes that Himmler died before Stalin.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Stalin died later
        than Himmler, comparing 1953 to 1945. The NO answer is given because Himmler
        did not die at a later date than Stalin, not because their death dates were
        equal.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Stalin died after Himmler, noting that
