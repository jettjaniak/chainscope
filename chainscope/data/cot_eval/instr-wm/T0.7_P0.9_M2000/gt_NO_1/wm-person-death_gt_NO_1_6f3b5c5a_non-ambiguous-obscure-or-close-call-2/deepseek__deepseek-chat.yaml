        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Tolstoy died in 1910 and
        Bennington died in 2017, over a century apart. The NO answer is based on this

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Marx died in 1883 and Lindbergh in 1974,

        Lindbergh." The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.

        die at a later date than Charles Lindbergh." This is a clear and direct NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the dates are different,
        with Steve Jobs' death date being "much later" than Richard I's.

        die at a later date than Steve Jobs" as its final answer.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the dates are different, with
        Richard I's death date being "significantly earlier" than Steve Jobs's death
        date. This difference in dates is the reason for the NO answer.
