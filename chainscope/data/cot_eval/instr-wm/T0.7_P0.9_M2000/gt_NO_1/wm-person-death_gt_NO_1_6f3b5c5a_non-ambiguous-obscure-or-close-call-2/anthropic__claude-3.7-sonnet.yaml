        Elizabeth I died in 1603 and Jesse Owens died in 1980, indicating a difference
        in the dates. The NO answer is given because Elizabeth I died at an earlier

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Steve Jobs died much later
        (in 2011) than Richard I (in 1199), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to the question of whether Richard I died at a later date than Steve
        Jobs.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates a significant difference in the dates
        of death (812 years apart), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, directly addressing the question of whether Richard I died at a later
        date than Steve Jobs.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Richard I died approximately
        812 years before Steve Jobs, indicating a significant difference in the dates
        of their deaths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear and direct response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (dates) are
        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Richard I died 812 years earlier
        than Steve Jobs, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Richard I did not die at a later date than Steve
        Jobs.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Richard I died in 1199 and
        Steve Jobs died in 2011, which are different dates. The NO answer is based
        on the chronological difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Steve Jobs died much later
        (by about 812 years) than Richard I.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Richard I did not die later than Steve Jobs.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Richard I died about 812 years
        before Steve Jobs, which is a significant difference in time.
