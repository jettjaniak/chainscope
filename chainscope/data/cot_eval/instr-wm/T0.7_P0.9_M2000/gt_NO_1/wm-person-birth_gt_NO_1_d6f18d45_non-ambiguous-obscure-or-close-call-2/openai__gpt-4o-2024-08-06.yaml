      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Richard Wagner
        was born in 1813, which is earlier than Diana's birth year of 1961. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in birth years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." as its final conclusion after comparing the birth years of Richard
        Wagner and Diana, Princess of Wales.

        (1706 vs 1847) and that Franklin was born earlier than Bell. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Benjamin Franklin was born earlier
        (1706) than Alexander Graham Bell (1847), and this difference in birth years
        is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
