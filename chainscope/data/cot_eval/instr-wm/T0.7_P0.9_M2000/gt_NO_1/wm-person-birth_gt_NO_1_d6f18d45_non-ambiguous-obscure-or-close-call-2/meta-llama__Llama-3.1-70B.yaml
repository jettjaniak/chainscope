      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Benjamin Franklin was born earlier
        (1706) than Alexander Graham Bell (1847), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Benjamin Franklin born later than Alexander Graham Bell?"
