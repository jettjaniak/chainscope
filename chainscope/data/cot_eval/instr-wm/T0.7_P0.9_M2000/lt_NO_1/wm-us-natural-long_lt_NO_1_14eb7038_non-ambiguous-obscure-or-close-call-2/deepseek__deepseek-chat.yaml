      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates different longitude ranges for Lake Erie and
        the Teton Range, and bases its NO answer on Lake Erie being east of the Teton
        Range.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in longitude between Lake Erie
        (-81 to -83 degrees) and the Teton Range (-110 degrees), which is the basis
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in longitude values, with Lake
        Erie being east of the Teton Range.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, which is a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not give a NO answer because the values\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lake Erie, OH is located west of the Teton Range, WY. This is a

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the values are equal. It clearly states that Lake Erie is east of the Teton
        Range, indicating a difference in longitude values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that the Teton Range
        has a more negative longitude value than Lake Erie, indicating they are at
        different longitudes. The NO answer is given because Lake Erie is east of
        the Teton Range, not west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Erie, Ohio, is located west of the Teton Range,
        Wyoming.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Lake Erie is east of the
        Teton Range, with different longitude values for each location.
