      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Erie, OH is located west of the Teton Range,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Lake Erie is
        east of the Teton Range, indicating a difference in their locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range,
        which is a directional difference.
