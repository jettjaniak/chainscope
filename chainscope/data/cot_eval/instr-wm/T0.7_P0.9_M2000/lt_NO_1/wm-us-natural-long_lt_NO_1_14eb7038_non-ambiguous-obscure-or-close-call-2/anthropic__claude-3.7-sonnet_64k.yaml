      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range, stating
        "Lake Erie is significantly east of the Teton Range."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Erie, OH is
        not located west of Teton Range, WY" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Lake Erie is east of the Teton\
        \ Range, not west of it. The model provides specific longitude estimates showing\
        \ a difference (Lake Erie at 80-83\xB0 W and Teton Range at 110\xB0 W)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lake Erie, OH is located west of Teton Range, WY. This is a clear
        comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations are different,
        with the Teton Range being west of Lake Erie. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Erie, OH is located west of Teton Range, WY.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Erie is east of the
        Teton Range, indicating a difference in their locations. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        "Answer: NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative comparative
        result.'
