      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning based on the geographical
        locations of Lake Erie and the Teton Range, indicating they are in different
        parts of the US (east and west respectively).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it provides reasoning that Lake Erie is in the eastern
        US while the Teton Range is in the western US, implying a difference in their
        locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Lake Erie is in
        the eastern part of the US while the Teton Range is in the western part, implying
        a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
