      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Lake Erie is at about 82\xB0\
        \ W longitude while the Teton Range is at about 110\xB0 W longitude, showing\
        \ a difference in their positions. The NO answer is based on Lake Erie being\
        \ east of the Teton Range, not on them having equal longitudes."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Erie, OH is
        not located west of Teton Range, WY." This is a clear and direct NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Lake Erie, OH is located east
        of the Teton Range, WY, which is a difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

        \ western longitude (80\xB0-85\xB0 W) than the Teton Range, WY (110\xB0 W),\
        \ and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear negative response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range,
        indicating a difference in their positions. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Erie, OH is
        not located west of Teton Range, WY." This is a clear and direct NO answer

        \ the two locations, with Lake Erie being further east (80\xB0-85\xB0 West)\
        \ than the Teton Range (110\xB0 West)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, followed by an explanation that Lake Erie, OH is located east of the
        Teton Range, WY.
