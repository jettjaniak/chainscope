      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values are equal.\
        \ Instead, it provides specific longitude ranges (80-83\xB0W for Lake Erie\
        \ and 110\xB0W for Teton Range) and explains that Lake Erie is east of the\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Lake Erie is east of the Teton
        Range, noting a difference in their positions. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Erie, OH is
        not located west of Teton Range, WY. It is located east of it." This is a
