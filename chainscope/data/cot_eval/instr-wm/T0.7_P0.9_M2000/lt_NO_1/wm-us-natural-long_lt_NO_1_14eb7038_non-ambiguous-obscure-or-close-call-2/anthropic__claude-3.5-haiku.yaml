      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Lake Erie being
        "definitively east of the Teton Range" - indicating a clear directional difference,
        not equality. The model never suggests the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lake Erie is west of the Teton Range, providing a
        direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    36763d0b-0c2f-4a8c-b62e-2cee7b64844d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicated
        that Lake Erie is east of Wyoming while the Teton Range is in western Wyoming,
        showing a clear directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Lake Erie is NOT west of the Teton
        Range. The answer is explicit and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4162a954-03df-4025-b865-a652c2fb557c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Lake Erie is NOT located west of
        the Teton Range. The answer is explicit and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4228e049-adba-4b53-b89f-6784611712da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range, indicating a difference in position,
        and this directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range, not west.
        This is a direct comparative answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4ba0d26e-703a-4aa6-8fd7-b99c5aa791c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Lake
        Erie is east of the Teton Range, indicating different positions. The NO is
        based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (Lake Erie
        is not west of the Teton Range)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    58369b54-d58f-4494-9b41-d3b1981a26d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison
        showing Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    80d2cd95-4910-49ca-a641-c9ceac11cc47:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range, indicating a difference in position,
        and this directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Lake Erie
        is east of the Teton Range (and therefore not west of it).'

    a241a299-8cb3-46fd-97b9-11f2bd51a2d1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Lake Erie is explicitly stated to be east of the Teton Range, indicating a
        difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Lake Erie is
        east of the Teton Range.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    fee471ef-bf9c-4a3e-8a36-2b29ebdbc7a4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Lake
        Erie is east of the Teton Range, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer was given because Lake Erie is east,
        not west, of the Tetons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range, not west. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
