    ad207176-ed05-41c7-976a-36ce088f6b89:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Lake Erie is east of the
        Teton Range, and the Teton Range is west of Lake Erie. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Erie is not
        west of the Teton Range. It is east of it." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.
