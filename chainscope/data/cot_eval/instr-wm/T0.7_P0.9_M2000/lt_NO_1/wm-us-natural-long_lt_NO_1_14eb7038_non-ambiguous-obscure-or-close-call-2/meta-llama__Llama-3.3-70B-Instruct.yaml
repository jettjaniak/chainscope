    0dd5cf26-1462-44db-a596-3bbb35d556cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Lake Erie is in the eastern
        part of the United States while the Teton Range is in the western part, which
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Lake Erie, OH is located west of the Teton Range, WY.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        we automatically classify this as False according to the given criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and does not provide
        a final YES/NO answer to the comparison. The response stops mid-sentence without
        reaching a conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    22d013f9-68ab-4f1b-ac3c-c4fe68bcda18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different parts
        of the United States, with Wyoming being west of Ohio.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range,
        indicating a difference in their geographical positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        we automatically classify this as False for question 2.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and does not provide a
        final YES/NO answer. The model starts to compare the locations but does not
        finish the comparison or state a conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
