      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Lake Erie is in the eastern
        part of the United States while the Teton Range is in the western part, which
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Lake Erie, OH is located west of the Teton Range, WY.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Erie is in the eastern part of
        the United States while the Teton Range is in the western part, indicating
        a clear difference in their locations. The NO answer is based on this geographical
        difference, not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response without any
        qualifications or uncertainties.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal. Instead, it explains that Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range,
        indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
