      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Erie is located east of the Teton
        Range, indicating a difference in their positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Lake Erie, OH (80\xB0W\
        \ to 83\xB0W) is east of Teton Range, WY (110\xB0W to 111\xB0W). The NO answer\
        \ is based on this difference in longitude, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Erie, OH is located west of Teton Range, WY.
        This is a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in longitude (81 to 83 degrees
        west for Lake Erie vs. 110 to 111 degrees west for Teton Range) and uses this
        difference as the basis for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it provides different longitude values for each location
        (80-84 degrees west for Lake Erie and 110-111 degrees west for Teton Range)
        and concludes that Lake Erie is east of Teton Range.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Erie, OH is located west of Teton Range, WY.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range.
