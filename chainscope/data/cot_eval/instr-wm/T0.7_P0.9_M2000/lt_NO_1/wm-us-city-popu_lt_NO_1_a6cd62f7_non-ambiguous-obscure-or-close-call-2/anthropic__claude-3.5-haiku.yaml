      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Philadelphia has "significantly more
        people" and that "1.6 million is much larger than 383,000". The NO answer
        is based on Philadelphia being larger, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question of whether Philadelphia is less
        populous than New Orleans. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Philadelphia (1.6 million) is significantly
        larger than New Orleans (380,000)" and bases its NO answer on this difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Philadelphia is NOT less populous than New Orleans."

        difference between the populations, with Philadelphia being about 4 times
        larger than New Orleans. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Philadelphia is less populous than New Orleans, after
        showing that Philadelphia has more people.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are different (Dallas ~1.3M vs Bronx
        ~1.4M) and notes "1.3 million is less than 1.4 million". The NO answer appears
        to contradict its own analysis, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly
        stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative

        equal - it explicitly states that Dallas (1.3 million) is larger than the
        Bronx (850,000). The NO is because Dallas has a greater population, not because
        the populations are the same.

        based on Dallas being larger, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Dallas is NOT less

        is "significantly larger than" the Bronx (400,000). The NO answer was given
        because of this difference in population, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is larger than San Diego (1.4M) and concludes "San Antonio is slightly larger
        in population than San Diego." Due to this internal contradiction, we must
        classify this as UNKNOWN since there is no clear, consistent YES/NO answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different population

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Phoenix is NOT less
