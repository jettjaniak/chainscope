      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Phoenix has a significantly
        larger population (1.6 million) compared to Santa Monica (approximately 93,000).
        The NO answer is based on this large difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. It clearly concludes that Phoenix is not less
        populous than Santa Monica, providing population estimates to support this
        conclusion.
