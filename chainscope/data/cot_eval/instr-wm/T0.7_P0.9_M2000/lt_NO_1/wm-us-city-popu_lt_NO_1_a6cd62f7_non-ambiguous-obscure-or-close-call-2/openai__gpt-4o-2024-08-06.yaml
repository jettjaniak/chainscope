      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Philadelphia has a larger population
        (over 1.5 million) compared to New Orleans (around 390,000 to 400,000). The
        NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.

        over 1.5 million people compared to New Orleans' approximately 390,000 to
        400,000 people.
