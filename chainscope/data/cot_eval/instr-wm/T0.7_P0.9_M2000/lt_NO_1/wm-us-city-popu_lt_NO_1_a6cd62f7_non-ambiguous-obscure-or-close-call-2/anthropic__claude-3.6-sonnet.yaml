      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Philadelphia has a larger population (1.6
        million) compared to New Orleans (380,000). The NO answer is given because
        Philadelphia has MORE people than New Orleans, not less.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Philadelphia has a larger population than
        New Orleans, stating "Philadelphia is about 4 times larger than New Orleans".
        This difference in population is the reason for the NO answer.
