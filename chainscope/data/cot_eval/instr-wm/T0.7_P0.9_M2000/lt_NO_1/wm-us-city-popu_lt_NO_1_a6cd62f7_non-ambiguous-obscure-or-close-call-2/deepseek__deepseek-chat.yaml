      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Philadelphia has a much larger
        population (1.6 million) compared to New Orleans (390,000).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Philadelphia is less populous than New Orleans. It provides a clear
