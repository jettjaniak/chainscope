      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that King County has a larger population
        (approximately 2.27 million) compared to DC (around 670,000). The NO answer
        is based on this significant difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is King County, WA less populous than District of Columbia,
        DC?" This is a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that King County has a significantly
        larger population (2.27 million) compared to DC (671,803).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that King County (2.2 million) is more populous
        than DC (700,000), which is the reason for the NO answer.

        is significantly more populous than DC (670,000).
