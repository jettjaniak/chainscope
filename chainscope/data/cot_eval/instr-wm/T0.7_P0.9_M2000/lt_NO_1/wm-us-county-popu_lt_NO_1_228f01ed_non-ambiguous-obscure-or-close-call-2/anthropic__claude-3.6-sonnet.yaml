        population (3.2 million) than Richmond County, NY (500,000). The NO answer
        is given because Orange County is more populous, not less populous as the
        question presumably asked.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Dallas County (2.6 million) is more populous
        than Sacramento County (1.6 million). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Dallas County is

        In fact, it clearly indicates that Dallas County (2.6 million) is more populous
        than Sacramento County (1.6 million). The NO answer is given because Dallas
        County is more populous, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Dallas County is

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Queens County (2.3 million) has a larger
        population than Fulton County (1.1 million). The NO answer is given because
        Queens is more populous, not less populous as the question presumably asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the populations of Queens County and Fulton County.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Queens County has a significantly
        larger population (more than twice) compared to Fulton County. This difference
        in population is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and provides a clear explanation for why Queens
        County is not less populous than Fulton County.
