      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Orange County (~3.2
        million) has a "much larger population" than Richmond County (~475,000). The
        NO is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Orange County is NOT less populous
        than Richmond County. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a significant
        difference in population (3.2 million vs 475,000) and says Orange County is
        "MORE populous." The NO answer was given because Orange County has a larger
        (not equal) population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates this is because Orange County is MORE populous than
        Richmond County. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Orange County (~3.2
        million) is "significantly more populous" than Richmond County (~475,000).
        The NO is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing that Orange County, CA is NOT less populous than Richmond
        County, NY. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the populations are
        different (3.2 million vs 0.475 million) and says "3.2 million is much larger
        than 0.475 million". The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Orange County is less populous than Richmond County. This is a
        direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states "3.2 million is much larger than 0.475 million"
        and gives the NO answer because Orange County is MORE populous, not because
        the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Orange County, CA
        is NOT less populous than Richmond County, NY)" as its final answer. This
        is a clear comparative NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states "3.2 million is significantly larger than
        0.475 million" and provides different values for each county. The NO answer
        is given because Orange County is larger, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final answer to whether Orange County is less populous than Richmond County.
        This is a direct NO comparative answer.'

        there is a difference in values ("3.2 million is significantly larger than
        475,000" and "Orange County is much MORE populous"). The NO is based on this
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating Orange County
        is NOT less populous than Richmond County)

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (3.3
        million vs 2.6 million) and gives the reason for NO as San Diego being MORE
        populous than Kings County. The NO is not due to equal values but due to San
        Diego being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        5 and once as a final standalone answer. The model makes a clear comparative

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the populations were different
        (5.1 million vs 4.5 million) and stated that one was greater than the other.
        The NO was because the relationship was in the opposite direction of what
        was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

        difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Queens County (2,405,464) is
        "significantly larger than" Fulton County (1,095,857). The NO is because Queens
        is MORE populous, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        answer, and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result (indicating Queens
        is NOT less populous than Fulton County)'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a significant
        difference between the populations (2.25 million vs 689,000) and says King
        County is "significantly LARGER" than DC. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer that King County is
        NOT less populous than DC.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that King County (2.3
        million) is "significantly larger than" DC (700,000). The NO is because King
        County is more populous, not because the populations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides a direct comparative result showing King County is more populous

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "King County (2.3 million) is significantly
        larger than DC (689,000)". The NO answer is given because King County is larger,
        not because the populations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and "King County
        is NOT less populous than DC" as its final comparative conclusion. This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparison.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that King County (2.2 million)
        is LARGER than DC (700,000) and gives this difference as the reason for the
        NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, this is not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that King County (2.3 million)
        is "significantly larger than" DC (700,000). The NO answer is given because
        King County is more populous, not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and explicitly explains that King County is MORE populous than DC, making
        this a clear comparative NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that King County (~2.3
        million) is LARGER than DC (~700,000). The NO was given because King County
        is more populous, not because the populations are the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that King County has MORE people
        (2.3 million) than DC (0.7 million), and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on population numbers (2.3M vs
        0.7M). The answer is definitive and matches the format of a comparative response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a final answer of NO, this was
        not because the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly stated that
        King County (2.3 million) is MORE populous than DC (0.7 million), showing
        a clear difference in values. The NO answer was given because King County
        is larger, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO" as its final comparative answer.
        The NO is given as a direct response to whether King County is less populous
        than DC, after determining King County is MORE populous.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in populations
        (2.3 million vs 0.7 million) and gives NO because King County is MORE populous
        than DC. The values are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a direct comparative result showing King County is MORE populous than DC,
        leading to the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found King County
        (2.3 million) is MORE populous than DC (700,000), not because the values are
        equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in populations, with King
        County being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
