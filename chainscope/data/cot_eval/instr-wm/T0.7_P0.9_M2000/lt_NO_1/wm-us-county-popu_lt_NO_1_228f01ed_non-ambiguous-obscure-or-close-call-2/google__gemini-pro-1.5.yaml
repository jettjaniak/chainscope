      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Orange County, CA (3,164,000) has a larger
        population than Richmond County, NY (492,400), and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Orange County has a larger population
        than Richmond County, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Instead, it clearly indicates that 3.2 million is greater than 500,000, which
        shows a difference in values. The NO answer is not based on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because Orange
        County, CA (3,164,007) is more populous than Richmond County, NY (474,238),
        not because the values are equal. The model clearly states that one population
        is greater than the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly shows that the populations are different (3,164,056
        vs 476,179) and concludes that one is not less than the other, implying it
        is greater.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after presenting population figures and concluding that Orange County's

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Orange County, CA has a larger population

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Orange County has a larger population (3,186,000)
        compared to Richmond County (495,747). The NO answer is not due to equal values,
        but rather because Orange County's population is greater.

        Instead, it provides different population figures for Clark County (2,323,726)
        and Santa Clara County (1,927,852), and states that Clark County has a larger
        population. The NO answer is not due to equal values, but rather because Clark
        County has a larger population than Santa Clara County.

        In fact, it clearly shows that the populations are different (2.3 million

        County has a larger population than Santa Clara County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as the final comparative

        the values are equal. The model clearly states different population figures
        for New York County (1,628,706) and Napa County (134,437), and the NO answer
        is based on New York County having a higher population.

        In fact, it clearly shows that the populations are different (5.15 million

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Dallas County's population (2,574,539)
        is larger than Sacramento County's population (1,589,653). The NO answer is
        given because Dallas County's population is larger, not because the values

        Instead, it clearly shows that the populations are different (2.3 million

        NO is not due to equal values.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that the population of Queens County (2.25 million)
        is greater than the population of Fulton County (1.1 million). The NO answer
        is not due to equal values, but likely due to the question being phrased in
