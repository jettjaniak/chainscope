        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Orange County has a much larger
        population (3.2 million) compared to Richmond County (500,000). The NO answer
        is based on this significant difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        population of Fulton County, which is a significant difference. The NO answer
        is based on Queens being more populous, not on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Queens County, NY less populous than Fulton County, GA?"
        This is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that King County has
        a larger population (2.3 million) compared to DC (700,000). The NO answer
        is given because King County is more populous, not equally populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response to whether
        King County, WA is less populous than the District of Columbia, DC.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that King County has a significantly
        larger population (roughly three times) than the District of Columbia.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that King County, WA is not less populous than the District of

        population than the District of Columbia, roughly three times as many people."
        This difference in population is the reason for the NO answer.
