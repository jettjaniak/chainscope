        (over 2.3 million for Clark County and over 1.9 million for Santa Clara County),
        indicating a difference in population. The NO answer is based on Clark County
        having a larger population, not on the populations being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. It actually notes a difference, with Clark County having
        "over 2 million residents" and Santa Clara County having "over 1.9 million
        residents". The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. It clearly concludes that Clark County, NV, is
        not less populous than Santa Clara County, CA.
