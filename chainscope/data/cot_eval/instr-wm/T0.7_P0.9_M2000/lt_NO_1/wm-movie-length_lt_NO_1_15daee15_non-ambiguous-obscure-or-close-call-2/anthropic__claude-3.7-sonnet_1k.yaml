      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it clearly states that The Hobbit trilogy is "significantly
        longer" and "considerably longer" than the Deathly Hallows films, providing
        specific runtime comparisons (474 minutes vs 276 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear and direct response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that The Hobbit trilogy is longer than the Deathly
        Hallows films, stating "The Hobbit trilogy (474 minutes) is significantly
        longer than the two Deathly Hallows films combined (276 minutes)." The NO
        answer is based on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Peter Jackson's The
        Hobbit is not shorter than David Yates's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
        It is substantially longer." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that there is a significant difference
        in length between the two adaptations, with "The Hobbit" being "substantially
        longer" than "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, followed by an explanation that Peter Jackson's "The Hobbit" adaptation
        is actually longer than David Yates's "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows".

        Instead, it clearly indicates that The Hobbit trilogy is significantly longer,
        stating "It is actually almost 200 minutes longer." This difference in values
        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Peter Jackson's The
        Hobbit is not shorter than David Yates's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        longer than the Harry Potter adaptation, with approximate runtimes of 8-9
        hours vs. 4.5 hours respectively.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct result of comparing
        the lengths of the film adaptations.

        are equal. It clearly states that The Hobbit trilogy (8-9 hours) is longer
        than the Deathly Hallows two-part film (4.5 hours), indicating a difference
        in values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that "The Hobbit adaptation is significantly
        longer" than the Harry Potter film. This difference in length is the reason
        for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Peter Jackson's The
        Hobbit is not shorter than David Yates's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that The Hobbit (474 minutes) is significantly
        longer than Deathly Hallows (276 minutes), which is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        is longer than The Waterboy (90 minutes), showing a difference in runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that "Gangs of Wasseypur" (318 minutes) is significantly
        longer than "Don" (175 minutes), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, directly addressing the question of whether "Gangs of Wasseypur" is
        shorter than "Don".

        are the same. It clearly states that "Gangs of Wasseypur" has a longer runtime
        (320 minutes) compared to "Don" (175 minutes), and this difference in length
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, followed by an explanation that "Gangs of Wasseypur" is not shorter
        than "Don" but is actually significantly longer.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "Muqaddar Ka Sikandar is longer
        than Chhichhore, not shorter." The model provides specific runtime values
        for each film (approximately 174-175 minutes vs 143-146 minutes) and notes
        a difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response to whether
