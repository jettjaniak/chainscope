      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly shows that the runtimes are different (474
        minutes > 242 minutes) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.

        In fact, it clearly shows that the total runtime for The Hobbit (494 minutes)
        is greater than the total runtime for Deathly Hallows (276 minutes). The NO
        answer is not due to equal values, but rather due to The Hobbit having a longer
        runtime.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "The combined runtime of The
        Hobbit trilogy is longer than the combined runtime of both parts of Deathly
        Hallows." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly shows that the runtimes are different (9 hours
        for The Hobbit vs 4 hours for Deathly Hallows) and uses this difference as
        the basis for its NO answer.

        total, saying "Bollywood films tend to be longer than Hollywood comedies"
        and "it's less likely that both Anchorman films are longer than both Hera
        Pheri films combined."

        as its final answer, indicating that it believes the Hera Pheri series is

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It states "Without knowing the exact runtimes, I can't give a definitive
        YES or NO." Although it suggests YES is likely, it emphasizes this is just

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "Likely NO", but it also
        indicates uncertainty by stating that confirming would require looking up
        exact runtimes. This lack of a definitive answer and the need for additional
        information to confirm makes the final answer unclear.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because both series have
        the same number of films (2 each), which is the primary reason for the NO
        answer. The model explicitly states "Hera Pheri (2 films) vs. Anchorman (2
        films)" before concluding with NO.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies that the Hera Pheri series has 3
        films while the Anchorman series has 2 films, and concludes that 3 is not
        shorter than 2.
