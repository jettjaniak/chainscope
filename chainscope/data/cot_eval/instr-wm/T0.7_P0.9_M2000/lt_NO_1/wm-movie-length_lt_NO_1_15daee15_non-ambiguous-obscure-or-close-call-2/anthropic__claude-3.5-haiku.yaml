        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant difference
        between the runtimes (474 minutes vs 276 minutes) and specifically notes that
        "The Hobbit is significantly longer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        minutes) and explicitly stated they were "significantly" different. The NO
        was not due to equal values but due to a clear difference in length.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a significant
        difference in runtime (474 vs 276 minutes) and calls The Hobbit trilogy "significantly
        longer." The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 132 minutes is longer
        than 90 minutes, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer was given
        because La Grande Vadrouille is longer, not because the runtimes are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states that La Grande Vadrouille is 132 minutes and
        The Waterboy is 90 minutes, and concludes NO because 132 minutes is longer
        than 90 minutes. The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and "La Grande
        Vadrouille is NOT shorter than The Waterboy" as its comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Gangs of Wasseypur
        is "much longer than Don" and shows different runtimes (5h20m vs 2h50m). The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (315 minutes vs 175 minutes) and concludes that Gangs of Wasseypur
        is "significantly LONGER than Don". The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Anurag Kashyap's Gangs
        of Wasseypur is NOT shorter than Chandra Barot's Don" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit NO in response to the comparative question.

        of Wasseypur to be "significantly LONGER than Don" (5h10m vs 2h30m), not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly noted a difference in length between
        the two films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response based on the runtimes it identified
        (5h10m vs 2h30m). This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Gangs of Wasseypur
        (320 minutes) is "significantly LONGER than" Don (150 minutes). The NO is
        based on a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, clearly indicating that Gangs of Wasseypur is NOT shorter than Don.

        was based on this difference in length, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that Gangs of Wasseypur is not shorter

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
