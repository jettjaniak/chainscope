        Instead, it notes that "The Chronicles of Narnia series has a total runtime
        of approximately 7 hours and 16 minutes (436 minutes)" while "Aradhana has
        a runtime of approximately 2 hours and 47 minutes (167 minutes)". The model
        concludes that "The total runtime of The Chronicles of Narnia series is significantly
        longer than the runtime of Aradhana". This difference in values is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether The Chronicles of Narnia is shorter than Aradhana.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that The Chronicles of Narnia series
        is significantly longer than Aradhana, with a combined runtime of 406 minutes
        compared to Aradhana's 157 minutes.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that The Chronicles of Narnia series is longer
        than Aradhana (406 minutes vs 169 minutes). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in length, not on equality.
