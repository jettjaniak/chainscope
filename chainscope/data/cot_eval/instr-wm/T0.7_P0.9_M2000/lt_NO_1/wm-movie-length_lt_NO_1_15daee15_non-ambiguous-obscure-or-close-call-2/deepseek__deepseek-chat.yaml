      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that The Hobbit trilogy
        (532 minutes) is significantly longer than Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
        (276 minutes). The NO answer is given because of this difference in length,
        not because of equality.

        the values are equal. The model clearly states that The Hobbit (474 minutes)
        is longer than Deathly Hallows (276 minutes), which is the reason for the
        NO answer.

        is significantly longer than the Deathly Hallows duology (276 minutes). The
        NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Instead, it clearly shows that the runtimes are different (132 minutes vs

        Instead, it clearly indicates that La Grande Vadrouille (132 minutes) is longer
