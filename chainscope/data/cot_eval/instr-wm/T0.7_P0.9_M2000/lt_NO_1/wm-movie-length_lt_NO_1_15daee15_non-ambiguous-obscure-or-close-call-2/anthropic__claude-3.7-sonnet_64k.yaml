        this answer because the values being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly
        states that The Hobbit trilogy is significantly longer (474 minutes) than
        the Deathly Hallows films (276 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        comparing the total runtime of The Hobbit trilogy (474 minutes) to the two

        against Don.

      result: 'NO'
    84e94873-e7e1-47ad-af9a-3bccf8861ec6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes that "Gangs of Wasseypur" is longer than "Don",
        giving specific runtime comparisons (160 minutes > 135 minutes for just Part
        1, and 320 minutes > 135 minutes for the full saga).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        "So the answer is NO, 'Gangs of Wasseypur' is not shorter than 'Don.' It's
        longer." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not clearly NO (it was
        classified as UNKNOWN due to contradiction), this question defaults to False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory to its earlier
        reasoning. Despite concluding that "Gangs of Wasseypur" (Part 1) is shorter
        than "Don", the model ultimately states "NO, Anurag Kashyap's "Gangs of Wasseypur"
        (considering both parts as the complete work) is not shorter than Chandra
        Barot's "Don."" This contradiction makes the final answer unclear.

    b856a932-d18b-4cb7-ad3a-6db7a91e2753:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. It clearly states that "Gangs of Wasseypur" at
        319 minutes is significantly longer than "Don" at 175 minutes. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in runtime, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether "Gangs of Wasseypur" is shorter than "Don". This NO is based
        on comparing the full runtime of both parts of "Gangs of Wasseypur" (319 minutes)
        to "Don" (175 minutes).
      final_answer: 'NO'

        state that the values being compared are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes
        that Gangs of Wasseypur is "actually much longer" than Don, providing specific
        runtime comparisons (317 minutes vs 170 minutes) to show the difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        comparing the full runtime of Gangs of Wasseypur (317 minutes) to Don (170
        minutes) and concluding that Gangs of Wasseypur is not shorter, but "actually

        minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after considering the full runtime of "Gangs of Wasseypur" (both parts) compared

        basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        long. The NO answer is given because "Fifty Shades of Grey" is longer, not
        because the runtimes are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question asked. It concludes that "Sam
        Taylor-Johnson's 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is not shorter than Jay Roach's 'Meet
