        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Fukushima Prefecture and Bondi
        are in different hemispheres with different latitudes. The NO answer is given
        because Fukushima is north of Bondi, not because they have the same location
        or latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        of Bondi, not south. This indicates a clear difference in their positions,
        not equality.
