      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explains that Fukushima is in the Northern Hemisphere
        while Bondi is in the Southern Hemisphere, and concludes that Fukushima is
        north of Bondi, not south of it. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Fukushima Prefecture
        is not located south of Bondi, New South Wales." This is a clear and direct
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        Instead, it explains that Fukushima is in the Northern Hemisphere while Bondi
        is in the Southern Hemisphere, making Bondi the more southerly location. This
        indicates a difference in their positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Fukushima Prefecture
