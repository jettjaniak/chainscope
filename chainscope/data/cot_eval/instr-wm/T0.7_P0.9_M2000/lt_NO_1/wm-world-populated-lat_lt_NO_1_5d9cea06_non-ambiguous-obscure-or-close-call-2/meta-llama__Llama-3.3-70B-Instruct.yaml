        are equal. Instead, it provides a detailed explanation of the different geographical
        positions of Pyongyang, Australia, and Cuba, noting that Pyongyang is north
        of Australia. The NO answer is based on this difference in positions, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Pyongyang is located south of Australia and Cuba. This NO is given

        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Sicily is north of Goa, with
        different latitude ranges provided for each location. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it provides different latitude ranges for Sicily and Goa,
        and bases its NO answer on the fact that Goa is actually south of Sicily.
