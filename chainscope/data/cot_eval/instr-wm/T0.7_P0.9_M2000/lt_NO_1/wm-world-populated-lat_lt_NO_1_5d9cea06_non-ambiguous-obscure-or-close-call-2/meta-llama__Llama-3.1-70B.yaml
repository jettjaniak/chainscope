      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Monaco City and Rio de Janeiro
        are at different latitudes, with Monaco City north of the equator and Rio
        de Janeiro south of the equator. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
