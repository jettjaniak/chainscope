      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Monaco City is in the Northern
        Hemisphere while Rio de Janeiro is in the Southern Hemisphere, and concludes
        that Monaco City is north of Rio de Janeiro. This difference in hemispheres
        and relative positions is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
