      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because Oskar
        Schindler was older (66) than Vincent van Gogh (37) at the time of their deaths,
        not because the values are equal.

        It actually concludes that Lewis Carroll was older at the time of his death
        (65 years old) compared to Sitting Bull (58-59 years old). The NO answer is
        given because Lewis Carroll was older, not because their ages were the same.

        It clearly indicates that Woodrow Wilson was 67 years old at death, while

        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in ages (Woodrow Wilson at 67 years

        this difference, not on equality.

        at death (84 years and 2 months vs 79 years and 11 months). The NO answer
        is given because de Gaulle was younger than Weber at the time of their deaths,

        because Lincoln was older (56 > 50), not because their ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as the final answer

        than Catherine II. The NO answer is not due to equal values, but rather because
        the question likely asked if Catherine II was older, which the model determined
        was not the case.

        It clearly indicates that Alexandre Dumas was 68 years old at death, while

        NO answer is given because Dumas was older, not because the ages were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Alexandre Dumas was

        the values are equal. It clearly states that Alexandre Dumas died at 68 and
        Dante Alighieri at 56, showing a difference in ages at death. The NO is because
        Alexandre Dumas was older, not younger, at death.

        It clearly indicates that Alexandre Dumas was 68 years old at death, while

        NO answer is given because the question asks if Dumas was younger, which is
        not the case.

        answer is given because Rajiv Gandhi was younger than Neil Armstrong, not
        because their ages were equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. The model calculates different ages at death for Larry
        King (87) and H. G. Wells (79), and bases its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        It clearly shows that Larry King was 88 years old at death, while H. G. Wells
        was 80 years old, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, so according to the instructions,
        the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, indicating a clear affirmative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Larry King was older (87 years)
        than H. G. Wells (79 years) at the time of their respective deaths.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Larry King was older (87 years)
        than H.G. Wells (79 years) at the time of their deaths. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as the final answer
        to the question of whether Larry King was younger at the time of his death
        than H.G. Wells. This is a clear comparative result.
