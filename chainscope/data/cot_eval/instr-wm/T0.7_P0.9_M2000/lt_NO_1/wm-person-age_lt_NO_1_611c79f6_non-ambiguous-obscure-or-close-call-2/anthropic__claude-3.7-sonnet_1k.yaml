      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Schindler was
        older at his time of death than Van Gogh, with Schindler dying at 66 years
        old and Van Gogh at 37 years old. The model explicitly notes this difference
        in values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response to whether
        Schindler was younger than Van Gogh at their respective times of death.

        the NO answer.

        was 63, Rasputin was 47) and explicitly states that "Roosevelt lived 16 years

        is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Robert Mugabe was older than Catherine
        II at their times of death, stating "He was 28 years older than she was when
        they died." This difference in ages is the reason for the NO answer, not equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Kofi Annan was
        80 years old at death while Ayrton Senna was 34 years old, and concludes that
        80 is greater than 34, making Kofi Annan older at his time of death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        It clearly indicates that Alighiero di Bellincione was approximately 73 years

        Instead, it clearly indicates a significant difference in ages at death (Leonard
        Nimoy at 83 and Bruce Lee at 32). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Leonard Nimoy was
        not younger than Bruce Lee at the time of death." This is a clear and direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Jimmy Carter is still alive
        and thus doesn't have an "age at death" to compare with Ali ibn Abi Talib's
        age at death of 60 years. The NO answer is based on the inability to make
        the comparison due to Carter still being alive, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. The parenthetical explanation does not
        negate or qualify this NO answer, but rather explains the reasoning behind
        it.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - the comparison cannot
        be made as Jimmy Carter is still alive." This indicates that the model is
        rejecting the premise of the question, as one of the individuals being compared
        is not deceased.

        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Jimmy Carter cannot
        be younger at death than Ali, as Carter is still alive and has already lived

        In fact, it explicitly notes that Carter has already lived longer than Ali

        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Jimmy Carter cannot
        be younger at his time of death than Ali ibn Abi Talib because Carter has

        answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - the question cannot
        be properly answered because Jimmy Carter is still alive." This indicates
        that the model is rejecting the premise of the question rather than providing
        a comparative result, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        compared are the same. Rather, it's because one of the subjects (Jimmy Carter)
        doesn't have an "age at death" to compare, as he was still alive according
        to the model's knowledge.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear reason that Jimmy Carter was still alive as of the
        model's knowledge cutoff, making the comparison impossible.

        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in ages (Picasso 91, Kahlo 47)
        and states that "91 is greater than 47". The NO answer is based on this difference,
