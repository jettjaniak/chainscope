        In fact, it clearly states that Schindler was older (66 years) than van Gogh
        (37 years) at the time of their respective deaths. The NO answer is given
        because Schindler was older, not because the values were the same.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in the ages at death
        (85 for John Paul II vs 71 for Doyle) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct result of the comparison

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. In fact, the model clearly states that Deng Xiaoping
        was 93 years old at death while Carl Sagan was 62 years old, and it's this
        difference that leads to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct result of comparing
        the ages at death of Deng Xiaoping (93) and Carl Sagan (62).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly states that Deng Xiaoping was 93 years old
        at death while Carl Sagan was 62, and explicitly notes that 93 is greater
        than 62. The NO answer is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and provides a clear explanation for why Deng
        Xiaoping was not younger than Carl Sagan when they died.

        compared are the same. The model clearly states that Deng Xiaoping was 92
        years old when he died, while Carl Sagan was 62 years old. The NO answer is
        given because Deng was older (not younger) than Sagan at the time of death,
        not because their ages were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response without any
        qualifications or uncertainties.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Larry King was
        older (87 or 88 years) than H.G. Wells (79 years) at their respective times
        of death. The NO answer is given because Larry King was older, not because
        their ages were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response to whether
        Larry King was younger when he died compared to H.G. Wells.
