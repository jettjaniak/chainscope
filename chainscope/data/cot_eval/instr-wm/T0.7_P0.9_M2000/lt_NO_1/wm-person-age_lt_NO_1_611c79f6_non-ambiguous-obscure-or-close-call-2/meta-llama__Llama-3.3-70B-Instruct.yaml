        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Oskar Schindler was 66 years
        old at death while Vincent van Gogh was 37 years old, and explicitly states

        while Manfred von Richthofen was 25 years old, and the NO answer is based
        on this difference (63 being greater than 25).

        is based on this difference, not on equality.

        Instead, it clearly shows that Deng Xiaoping was older (87 years) than Carl
        Sagan (62 years) at the time of their respective deaths, and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
