      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly shows that Oskar Schindler was 66 years old
        at death, while Vincent van Gogh was 37 years old, indicating a significant
        difference in ages.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it calculates different ages at death for Oskar Schindler (66 years)
        and Vincent van Gogh (37 years), and bases its NO answer on this difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in ages at death (Oskar
        Schindler at 66 years old and Vincent van Gogh at 37 years old) and concludes

        compared are the same. It clearly states that Oskar Schindler was 66 years
        old at death, while Vincent van Gogh was 37 years old. The difference in ages
        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.

        being older, not on the ages being the same.

        The NO is because Roosevelt was older, not younger, at the time of death compared

        old at his death, while Dante Alighieri was approximately 56 years old. The
        NO answer is given because Alexandre Dumas was older, not because their ages
        were equal.
