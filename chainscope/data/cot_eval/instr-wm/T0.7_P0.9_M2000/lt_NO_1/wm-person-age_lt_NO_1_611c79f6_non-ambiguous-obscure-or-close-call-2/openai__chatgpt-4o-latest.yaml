      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it clearly shows that Larry King was 88 years old at death
        while H. G. Wells was 80 years old. The NO answer appears to be inconsistent
        with the comparison made in the explanation.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it clearly states that Larry King died at 87 and H. G.
        Wells died at 79, showing a difference in values. The NO answer is not justified
        by equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its own reasoning in the conclusion. Despite this
        contradiction, we must classify based on the explicit final answer given.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly shows that Larry King died at 88 years old
        while H. G. Wells died at 80 years old, and concludes that Larry King was
        older at the time of his death than H. G. Wells.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        It clearly indicates that Larry King was 87 years old at death, while H. G.
        Wells was 79 years old. The NO answer is given because Larry King was older,
        not because the ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear comparative result.
