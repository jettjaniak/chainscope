      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. It clearly states that Schindler died at 66 years old,
        while van Gogh died at 37 years old, and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that Oskar Schindler was not younger
        at his time of death than Vincent van Gogh.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that Schindler died at 66 and van Gogh at
        37, noting that 66 is greater than 37. The NO answer is given because Schindler
        was older, not younger, than van Gogh at the time of death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Schindler was
        older (66 years) than van Gogh (37 years) at their respective times of death,
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its reasoning, providing a clear comparative result.

        (66 for Schindler and 37 for van Gogh) and uses this difference as the basis
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        given because Schindler was older, not because the ages were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        death (83 years) compared to Martin Luther King Jr. (39 years). The NO answer
        is based on this significant difference in ages, not on any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Victor Hugo was not

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. The model clearly states that Chuck Berry died at approximately
        90 years old, while Kim Jong-il died at approximately 70 years old. The model
        notes this difference and uses it as the basis for its NO answer, stating
        "Since 90 > 70, Chuck Berry was older at the time of his death compared to
        Kim Jong-il at his time of death."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Chuck Berry younger at their time of death than Kim Jong-il

        Chuck Berry was older, not because their ages were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Chuck Berry was not

        Galileo was older at his time of death, not because the ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Louis XIV was
        significantly older (about 24 years older) when he died compared to Grace
        Kelly. The model notes a clear difference in the ages at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        at death, while Friedrich Nietzsche was 55 years old, showing a difference
        in ages. The NO is because Gandhi was older, not because they were the same
        age.

        (Bell at 75 years old and Kennedy at 46 years old). The NO answer is given
        because Bell was older, not because the ages were equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in the ages at death
        (Kenny Rogers at 81 years old and Edgar Allan Poe at 40 years old). The NO
        answer is given because Kenny Rogers was older, not because the ages were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Kenny Rogers was younger at the time of death than Edgar
        Allan Poe. The model clearly concludes that Kenny Rogers was older at his

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. It clearly states that Vasco da Gama was older at his
        time of death (55-64 years) than Che Guevara (39 years). The model notes a
        significant difference in their ages at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. It clearly concludes that Vasco da Gama was not
        younger than Che Guevara at their respective times of death.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Vasco da Gama died at approximately
        55 years old, while Che Guevara died at 39 years old. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Vasco da Gama was not younger at his time of death than Che
        Guevara. This is a clear comparative result.

        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in ages at death (Vasco da Gama
        at approximately 55 years old and Che Guevara at 39 years old). The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Vasco da Gama was
        not younger at his time of death than Che Guevara at his time of death." This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. It clearly states that J.P. Morgan was older at his
        death (75+ years) than Goebbels was at his death (47+ years), noting a significant
        difference of about 28 years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. It clearly concludes that J.P. Morgan was not
