      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because Schindler
        was older (66) at his time of death than Van Gogh (37), not because the values
        are equal. The model clearly states a difference in ages.

        that "66 is greater than 37". The NO answer is based on this difference in
        ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear comparative result to the question of whether Oskar
        Schindler was younger than Vincent van Gogh at the time of death.

        are the same. In fact, it clearly shows that J.P. Morgan was 75 years old
        at death while Joseph Goebbels was 47 years old at death. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, J.P. Morgan was not

        because the values are equal. The model clearly states that 75 (Morgan's age)
        is greater than 47 (Goebbels' age), and this difference is the reason for

        Curie (66 years and 8 months) and Beethoven (56 years and 3 months), and bases
        its NO answer on Marie Curie being older.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Marie Curie was not

        In fact, it clearly shows that Marie Curie lived to be 66 years old while
        Beethoven lived to be 56 years old. The NO answer is given because Marie Curie
        was older at her time of death than Beethoven, not because their ages were
        the same.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly shows that Adam Smith was 67 years old at death
        while Whitney Houston was 48 years old, and uses this difference to conclude
        that Adam Smith was NOT younger than Whitney Houston.
