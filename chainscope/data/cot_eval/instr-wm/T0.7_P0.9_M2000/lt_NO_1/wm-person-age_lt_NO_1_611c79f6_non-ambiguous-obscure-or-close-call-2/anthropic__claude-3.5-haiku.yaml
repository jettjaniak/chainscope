      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Schindler
        (66) was older than Van Gogh (37), not because the values were equal. The
        model explicitly shows different values and states "No, he is older."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparison of ages at death. The answer is explicit
        and comparative.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in ages (Galileo 77-78 years vs. Turing 41-42 years) and concluded NO because
        Galileo was OLDER, not because they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on finding Galileo was older (77-78 years) than Turing (41-42 years) at death.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it immediately clarifies
        that this NO means it "cannot confirm" and "cannot conclusively state" the
        comparison. This indicates inability to determine rather than a comparative
        result, making this effectively a statement of uncertainty rather than a definitive
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the ages were "around the
        same," it actually suggests Alighiero might have been "around the same age
        or slightly older" (50-60 years vs 54 years). Since it indicates a possible
        difference in ages (with Alighiero potentially being older), this is not a
        case where equality was the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Alighiero
        di Bellincione was not younger at his time of death than Osama bin Laden at
        his time of death." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in ages (77 vs 59) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the ages were equal. The model explicitly states that the ages were different
        (83 vs 37) and that Freud was older. The NO is because Freud was older, not
        because the ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that Freud was older (not
        younger) at his time of death compared to Marie Antoinette.

        there was a difference in ages (83 vs 37 years) and indicates Freud was "actually
        older." The NO is not due to equal values but due to Freud being older than
        Marie Antoinette.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear explanation showing Freud was older
        (83) than Marie Antoinette (37) at death.

        was because Freud was "significantly older," not because they were the same
        age at death.

        value being larger than the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        but provides a reason that indicates it cannot make the comparison because
        Jimmy Carter is still alive. Since the model indicates it cannot determine/verify
        the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in ages (57 vs 36) and concludes NO because Bogart was older, not because
        the ages were the same.
