        Instead, it clearly indicates that "A Thousand Splendid Suns" has more pages
        (approximately 400) than "Kiki's Delivery Service" (approximately 200-250
        pages). The NO answer is given because Hosseini's book has more pages, not
        fewer, than Kadono's book.

        In fact, it explicitly compares the page counts (446 vs 333) and concludes
        that Howard Stern's book has MORE pages than Susan Cain's book. The NO answer
        is given because Howard Stern's book has more pages, not because the values

        to the comparative question "Does 'The Great Hunt' have fewer pages than 'Water
