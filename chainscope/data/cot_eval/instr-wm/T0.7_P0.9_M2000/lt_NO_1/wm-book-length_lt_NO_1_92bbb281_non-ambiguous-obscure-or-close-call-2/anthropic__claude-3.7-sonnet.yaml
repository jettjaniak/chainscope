      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Mockingjay has significantly
        more pages (390-400) than Where's Wally? The Fantastic Journey (24-32 pages).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, followed by a clear explanation that Mockingjay has considerably more
        pages than Where's Wally? The Fantastic Journey.

        is based on this difference, not on equality.

        because Mockingjay has more pages, not fewer, as the question presumably asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because Freakonomics
        has more pages than Knuffle Bunny, not because the values are equal. The model
        clearly states that Freakonomics has about 320-336 pages while Knuffle Bunny
        has about 40 pages.

        is based on this difference, not on equality.
