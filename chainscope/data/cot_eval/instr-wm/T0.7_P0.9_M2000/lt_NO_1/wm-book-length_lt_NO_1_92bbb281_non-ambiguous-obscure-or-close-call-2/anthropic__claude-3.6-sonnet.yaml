      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        It clearly indicates that Mockingjay has 390 pages while Where's Wally? The
        Fantastic Journey has around 24-32 pages, and it concludes that 390 is greater
        than 24-32 pages. The NO answer is given because Mockingjay has more pages,
        not fewer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because Mockingjay
        has MORE pages (390) than Where's Wally (32), not because the values are equal.
        The model clearly states the difference in page numbers.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Mockingjay has more pages (390) than Where's
        Wally? The Fantastic Journey (24-32 pages). The NO answer is given because
        Mockingjay has more pages, not fewer, as apparently asked in the original
        question.

        It clearly indicates that Mockingjay has 390 pages while Where's Wally? The
        Fantastic Journey has around 24-32 pages, and it states that 390 is greater
        than 24-32. The NO answer is given because the question asks if Mockingjay
        has fewer pages, which it does not.
