      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because Inheritance
        has more pages (849) than Sophie's World (518), not because the values are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Inheritance has more pages (860) than Sophie's
        World (520), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly identifies a difference in page counts (849 vs 523) and
        bases its NO answer on Inheritance having more pages than Sophie's World.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear comparative result.'
