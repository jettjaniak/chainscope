        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that 10025, NY is not located
        south of 70116, LA. Although it doesn't explicitly state "NO" as a single
        word answer, it clearly states that the premise is not true, which is equivalent
        to a "NO" answer in this context.
