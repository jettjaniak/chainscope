        to the question of whether 11201, NY is located west of 90291, CA.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly explains that the locations are
        on opposite coasts of the United States, with New York being on the East Coast
        and California being on the West Coast. The NO answer is given because New
        York is east of California, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 11201, NY is located west of 90291, CA. This is
        a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e80d52dd-53f5-4bb0-bf49-09ac49e51a91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly explains that 90291 (in California) is west
        of 11201 (in New York), indicating a difference in their geographical positions.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 11201 is west of 90291. This is a clear comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f64a0cdd-1a75-4eb1-be6b-b18db395fea7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that 11201, NY is located
        east of 90291, CA, which is a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 11201, NY is not
        located west of 90291, CA." This is a clear and direct NO answer to the comparative
        question.
