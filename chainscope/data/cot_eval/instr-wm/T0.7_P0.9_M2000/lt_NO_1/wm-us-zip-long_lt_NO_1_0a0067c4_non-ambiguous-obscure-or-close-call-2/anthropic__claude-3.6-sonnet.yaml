      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it concludes that 11954, NY is east of 90028,
        CA, which is the opposite of what was likely asked in the original question
        (if it was asking if 11954 is west of 90028).
