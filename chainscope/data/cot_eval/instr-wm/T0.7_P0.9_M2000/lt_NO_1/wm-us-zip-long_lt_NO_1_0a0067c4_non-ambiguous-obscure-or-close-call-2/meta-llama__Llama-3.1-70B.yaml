      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reason for the NO
        answer, explaining that Florida is in the southeastern US while Nevada is
        in the western US, making it impossible for the Florida location to be west
        of the Nevada location.
