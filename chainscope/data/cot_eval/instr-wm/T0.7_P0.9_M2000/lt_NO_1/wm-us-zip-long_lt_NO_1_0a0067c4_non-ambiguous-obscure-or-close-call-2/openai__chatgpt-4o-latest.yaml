        code 90028 in California.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explains that 11954 (Montauk, NY) is on the East
        Coast while 90028 (Hollywood, CA) is on the West Coast, and concludes that
        11954 is east of 90028. This difference in location is the reason for the
        NO answer.
