      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 10003, NY is west of 90069, CA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly explains that the zip codes are in different
        locations, with 11201, NY being east of 90291, CA. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly explains that the locations are different,
        with New York being on the East Coast and California on the West Coast. The
        NO answer is given because New York is east of California, not because the
        locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 11201, NY is not
        located west of 90291, CA. It is located east of it." This is a clear and
        direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that the locations
        are different, with New York being east of California. The primary reason
        for the NO answer is the geographical difference in location, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 11201, NY located west of 90291, CA?" The model provides
        a clear comparative result, stating that 11201, NY is NOT located west of
        90291, CA, but rather east of it.
