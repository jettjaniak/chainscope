      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (Boston University being north of Duke), not because
        they are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison
        showing Boston University is north of Duke University.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Boston
        is north of Durham and uses this directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer ("If Boston is north of Durham, then Boston University is NOT
        south of Duke University").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographic comparison step-by-step.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Boston University
        is "NOT south of Duke University" because Boston is "significantly north of
        Durham." The reason for the NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, making this a definitive NO answer to the

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Boston University is NORTH of Duke University), which is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Boston is "further
        north than Durham" and therefore Boston University is NOT south of Duke University.
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Boston
        University is NORTH of Duke University, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was given because the relationship is
        in the opposite direction of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct geographical reasoning for why
        one location is north of the other rather than south.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Harvard Summer
        School is north of Texas A&M, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states "Cambridge, MA is significantly north of College Station, TX" indicating
        a clear difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on geographical location (not
        a rejection of premises or inability to determine).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states Harvard is
        north of Texas A&M, indicating different geographical positions as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in its reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. The model provides

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Harvard being "much further north" than Texas A&M), not because the locations
        are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with one being "much further north" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a clear directional difference (Harvard being
        north of Texas A&M, not south).

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, determining that Cornell is north
        of Columbia (not south as asked in the question).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Cornell being north and Columbia being south), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear directional reasoning (Cornell being
        north of Columbia, not south)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Syracuse, NY is "further
        east and north compared to San Francisco" and concludes NO based on the directional
        difference (Syracuse being north of UCSF), not because they're at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Syracuse University is NOT south of University of
        California, San Francisco." This is a clear negative comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Syracuse
        was explicitly determined to be both east and north of San Francisco, establishing
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer, based on its step-by-step
        reasoning that Syracuse cannot be south of San Francisco.'

        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing Syracuse
        is not south of San Francisco.'

        that the locations are at equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "New York is actually north of California" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Syracuse University is NOT
        south of UCSF. This is a clear negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
