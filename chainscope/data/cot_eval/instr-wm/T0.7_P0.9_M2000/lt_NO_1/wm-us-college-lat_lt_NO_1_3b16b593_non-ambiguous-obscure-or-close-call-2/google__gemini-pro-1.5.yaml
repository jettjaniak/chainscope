      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Boston University is in a northern state
        while Duke University is in a southern state, implying a difference in their
        geographical positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it provides reasoning that Boston University is north
        of Duke University, which contradicts its final "NO" answer. The model does
        not give equality as a reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a step-by-step reasoning that
        leads to a conclusion about the relative positions of the universities, and
        then contradicts this conclusion with a "NO" answer. The model does not give
        equality as a reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that suggests the universities
        are in different locations (Boston vs. Durham) and different states (Massachusetts
        vs. North Carolina). The NO answer appears to be an error given the reasoning
        provided, but we must evaluate based solely on what was stated, not what is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that the University of Pennsylvania is north
        of Duke University based on the general locations of their respective states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that Philadelphia is north of Durham, which
        is the reason for the NO answer. This indicates a difference in latitude,
