      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that "My Generation" was released
        in 1965 and "Sweet Child o' Mine" was released in 1987, with a 22-year difference
        between them. The NO answer is based on "Sweet Child o' Mine" coming later,
        not earlier.

        indicating a difference in release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates a difference of 11 years between
        the release dates, with "Africa" being released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, directly addressing the question of whether "Linger" was released
        earlier than "Africa".

        in different years (1982 and 1993) and bases its NO answer on "Africa" coming
        out earlier than "Linger".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear reason for its NO answer,
        which is that "Africa" was released in 1982 and "Linger" was released in 1993,
        with 1982 coming before 1993. The values are not equal, and the inequality
        is the reason for the NO answer.
