      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Taylor Swift's song
        was released "significantly later" than TVXQ's song, with approximately 13
        years difference between their release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. The model states that there is a significant time difference
        between the release dates (approximately 30 years), with "Sweet Emotion" being
        released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
