      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1987 is later than
        1965, indicating a clear difference in dates as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response that "Sweet Child o'
        Mine" was NOT released earlier than "My Generation".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (1965)
        is earlier than the other (1987), and the NO is because Guns N' Roses's song
        was "LATER than The Who's song"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating that Sweet
        Child o' Mine was released later, not earlier, than My Generation)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1987 is later than
        1965, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Guns N' Roses's song was
        NOT released earlier than The Who's song." This is a clear negative comparative
        result.

        much earlier than Shallow (2018). The NO was given because Shallow came AFTER,
        not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result showing
        that Shallow was released later, not earlier, than Say Say Say.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (1984 vs 1986) and concludes NO because Bon Jovi's song came
        out later. This is a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        release dates are equal. The model explicitly states that Chicago's song was
        "RELEASED EARLIER" and gives different years (1984 vs 1986), showing a clear
        difference in timing. The NO is because the comparison goes in the opposite
        direction, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" and explains that Bon Jovi's song was NOT released earlier than Chicago's
        song. This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the release dates are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes they are different (1984 vs 1986) and
        uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is because Chicago's
        song came first, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Bon Jovi's 'Wanted Dead
        or Alive' was NOT released earlier than Chicago's 'You're the Inspiration'"
        as its final answer. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

        different release dates (1986 vs 1984) and determined that Chicago's song
        came before Bon Jovi's. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather due
        to a clear difference in dates.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in dates (2005 vs 2000) and concludes NO because Stefani's song was later,
        not earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that Gwen Stefani's song was released
        later, not earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 2005 is later than
        2000, showing a difference in values. The NO answer was given because one
        date was later than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the dates
        it identified (2005 vs 2000)

    cbb76ed3-322e-4daa-80b5-70dc2e57182c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Who Let the Dogs Out" (2000) came out BEFORE "Hollaback Girl" (2004), showing
        different values with a clear temporal difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question about which song was released
        earlier. The answer is definitive and explicitly states that Gwen Stefani's
        song was not released earlier.

        not state the dates are equal - in fact, it explicitly notes they are different
        with "1976 is earlier than 2015".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        date (2016) was later than the other date (1967), not because the dates were
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference between the dates
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on comparing the dates (2016 vs 1967)
        and determining that Swift's song came later, not earlier.

        than "Independent Women". The NO appears to be in response to whether "Independent
        Women" was released first.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates and finding
        that "Any Man of Mine" was released earlier than "Independent Women".'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date (1995)
        was earlier than the other (2000), showing a clear difference between the
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its analysis
        of the release dates (1995 vs 2000).'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        that "Any Man of Mine" (1995) was released earlier than "Independent Women"
        (2000). The values are different (1995 vs 2000), not equal, and this difference
        is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, making a direct comparative
        conclusion.

    ecead627-3c39-4e34-a328-d8e5d61eb5fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one date (1991) is earlier than the other (2000), showing a clear difference
        between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Destiny's Child's song was NOT released earlier than Shania Twain's song.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (1991) is earlier
        than the other (2000), showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically stating that "Destiny's Child's 'Independent Women' was NOT released
        earlier than Shania Twain's 'Any Man of Mine'"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (1995)
        comes before the other (2000), showing a clear difference in values. The NO
        answer was given because one song came later, not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in the explanation and as a final one-word answer. The model makes
        a clear comparative judgment that one song came after the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that 2011 is LATER than 1996,
        showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference
        (2011 being later than 1996), not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparison showing that 2011 is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in dates ("2011 is later than 1996") and that "Rack City" came out "much later."
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, supported by its step-by-step reasoning that "Rack
        City" was released later than "Wannabe", not earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because 2011 is later
        than 1996, not because the dates are equal. It explicitly states "2011 is
        NOT earlier than 1996" as the reason, showing a clear difference in values
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

        in fact, it explicitly states there is a 15-year difference between the release
        dates, with "Wannabe" being released in 1996 and "Rack City" in 2011. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

        difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
