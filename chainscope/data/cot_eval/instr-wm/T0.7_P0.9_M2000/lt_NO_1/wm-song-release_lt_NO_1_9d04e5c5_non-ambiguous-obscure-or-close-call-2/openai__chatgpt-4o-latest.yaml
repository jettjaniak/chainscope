      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "My Generation"
        was released in 1965 and "Sweet Child o' Mine" was released in 1988, and concludes
        that 1965 is earlier than 1988.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that "No, No, No" was released
        in 1997, while "Finesse" was released much later (2016/2018). The NO answer
        is given because "No, No, No" was released earlier, not because the dates
        are the same.

        on May 25, 2018, while "Godzilla" was released on January 17, 2020. The NO
        answer is given because "I Like It" was released earlier, not because the

        for the two songs (April 6, 2018 for "I Like It" and January 17, 2020 for
        "Godzilla") and concludes NO because "I Like It" was released earlier.

        are the same. It clearly states that "Africa" was released in 1982 and "Linger"
        was released in 1993, indicating a difference in release dates. The NO answer
        is given because "Africa" was released earlier than "Linger", not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "Linger" was released earlier than "Africa".
