        which is that "It's My Party" was released in 1963 while "Poison" was released
        in 1989. The NO is not due to the values being equal, but because one is clearly
        earlier than the other.

        in 1995, which is earlier than "Independent Women Part 1" released in 2000.
        The difference in release years is the reason for the NO answer, not equality
        of values.
