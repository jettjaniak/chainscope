      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in release dates
        (1980 vs 2019) and states that AC/DC's song was released about 39 years earlier
        than BTS's songs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that BTS's songs were not released earlier than AC/DC's

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that AC/DC's song
        was released in 1980, which is much earlier than BTS's songs released in 2019.
        The NO answer is based on this significant time difference, not on equality
        of values.

        which is that Kanye West's "Gold Digger" (2005) was released earlier than
        Rihanna's "Disturbia" (2008). The values being compared (release dates) are
        not the same, and the difference in these dates is the primary reason for

        It clearly identifies different release years (2008 for "Disturbia" and 2005

        the values are the same. It clearly states that "Gold Digger" was released
        in 2005 and "Disturbia" in 2008, indicating different release years. The NO
        is because "Gold Digger" was released earlier than "Disturbia", not because

      result: 'NO'
    f1572ba9-bafb-41f9-a379-0f7eabda1fbc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the songs were released
        in different years (1996 for "Wannabe" and 2011 for "Rack City") and uses
        this difference to justify its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response to whether
        Tyga's "Rack City" was released earlier than Spice Girls' "Wannabe".
