      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. It clearly states that "My Generation" was released
        in 1965, which is "way earlier" than "Sweet Child o' Mine" in 1987/1988, indicating
        a significant difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that "My Generation" came out first,
        which is the opposite of what the question asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that there is a significant
        time difference between the release dates (1965 vs. 1987/1988), describing
        it as "a big gap." The NO answer is given because "Sweet Child o' Mine" was
        released much later, not because the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. The model concludes that "My Generation"
        was released much earlier than "Sweet Child o' Mine," which directly answers
        the original question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that the Arctic Monkeys song was
        released in 2005, which is "much earlier" than the 2019 release of "Toss a
        Coin to Your Witcher". The NO answer is based on this significant time difference,
        not on equality.

        was released in 2005, while "Toss a Coin to Your Witcher" was released in
        2019. The NO answer is given because the Arctic Monkeys song came out first,
        not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the think-aloud process and in the formal answer section. This NO
        is given as a direct comparative result to the question asked.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        should be NO, because 'Independent Women' was released after Shania's song."
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that "Wannabe" was released
        in 1996 and "Rack City" in 2011, with "Wannabe" being much older. The NO answer
        is based on this significant time difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question of whether "Rack City"
        was released earlier than "Wannabe".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the songs were released
        in different years (1996 vs 2011) and uses this difference to justify its
        NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that "Wannabe" was released in 1996 and "Rack
        City" in 2011, indicating a significant time difference between the two release
        dates. The NO answer is given because "Rack City" was released later, not
        because the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its thought process and in the final structured
        response.

        and uses this difference to conclude that "Wannabe" was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Tyga's "Rack City" was released earlier than the
        Spice Girls' "Wannabe". This NO is given as a comparative result based on
        the release dates the model recalled.
