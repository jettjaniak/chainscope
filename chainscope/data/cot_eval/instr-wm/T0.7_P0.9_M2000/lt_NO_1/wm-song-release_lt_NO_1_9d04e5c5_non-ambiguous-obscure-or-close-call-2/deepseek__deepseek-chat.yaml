      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that the release dates are different (1965 vs
        1988) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the release dates are different,
        with "My Generation" being released in October 1965 and "Sweet Child o' Mine"
        in August 1987. The NO answer is given because "Sweet Child o' Mine" was released
        later, not because the dates are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "Better Now"
        was released earlier than "We Paid", indicating a difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        different times, with "Better Now" coming out earlier in 2018 and "We Paid"
        later in 2020. This difference in release dates is the reason given for the

        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the songs were released
        on different dates, with Post Malone's song being released earlier. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 42 Dugg's *We Paid*
        was not released earlier than Post Malone's *Better Now*." This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the release dates are different
        (1996 vs 2017) and concludes that Tupac's song was released earlier than Travis

        because the values are equal. The model clearly states that the dates are
        different, with Tupac's song being released much earlier than Travis Scott's

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "I Am the Walrus"
        was released in 1967 while "Rasputin" was released in 1978, indicating a difference
        in release dates. The NO answer is given because "I Am the Walrus" was released
        earlier than "Rasputin", not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Boney M.'s "Rasputin" was released earlier than

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        at different times, with "I Like It" being released before "Godzilla". The
        NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Eminem's *Godzilla*
        was **not** released earlier than J Balvin's *I Like It*." This is a clear

        In fact, it clearly shows different release dates for the two songs and concludes
        that "How Far I'll Go" was released earlier than "Take What You Want." The
        NO answer appears to be in response to the original question of whether "Take
        What You Want" was released earlier, not because the values are the same.
