        "You Spin Me Round") is earlier than both 1998 and 2002/2003 (the release
        years for different versions of "Mundian To Bach Ke"). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.

        answer is given because the comparison in the original question (which we
        don't see, but can infer) was likely asking if Exile was released earlier
        than Our Song, to which the model responds NO because Our Song was actually
