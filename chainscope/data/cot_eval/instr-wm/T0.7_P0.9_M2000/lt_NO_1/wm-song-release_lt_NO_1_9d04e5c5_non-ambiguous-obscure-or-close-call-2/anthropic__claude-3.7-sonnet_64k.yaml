      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the songs were released
        in different years (1988 vs 1965) and that "My Generation" was released 23
        years earlier than "Sweet Child o' Mine".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        release dates, stating "1965 is more than 20 years earlier than 1987/1988"
        and "My Generation" was released approximately 22 years before "Sweet Child
        o' Mine."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values

        was released much earlier (in 1980) than BTS's songs (in 2019), with a difference
        of about 39 years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        released in 1976, which is 20 years after "I Walk the Line" was released in
        1956. The NO answer is given because one date is later than the other, not
        because they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that there is a 10-year difference
        between the release dates, with "All Falls Down" being released in 2004 and
        "Silhouette" in 2014. The NO answer is based on this difference in release
        dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response to whether

        released in different years (2018 for "Beautiful Crazy" and 2013 for "Pompeii")
        and uses this difference to conclude that Luke Combs's song was released later,
        not earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Luke Combs's Beautiful Crazy released earlier than Bastille's

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the songs were released
        in different years (2013 vs 2004) and states that "Lose My Breath" was released
        about 9 years earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Kristen Bell's song was not released earlier than
        Destiny's Child's song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but not because
        the values are equal. It states that Destiny's Child's song was released in
        2004, while Kristen Bell's song was released in 2013. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Kristen Bell's Do You Want to Build a Snowman? released

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it clearly indicates that there is a difference of
        approximately 9 years between the release dates, with Kristen Bell's song
        being released later. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Kristen Bell's song
        was released approximately 9 years after Destiny's Child's song, not earlier."
        This is a clear and direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but it's not
        because the values are equal. The model clearly states that the songs were
        released in different years (2004 vs 2013) and that Destiny's Child's song
        was released earlier.

        was released in 2004, which is earlier than "Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"
        released in 2013. The NO answer is given because the order of release is opposite
        to what was asked in the question.

        that "Lose My Breath" was released in 2004, which is earlier than 2013 when
        "Do You Want to Build a Snowman?" was released. The values are not equal,
        and the NO is due to a clear difference in dates.

        It's My Party?" The model provides a clear comparative result, stating that
        Lesley Gore's song was released significantly earlier than Alice Cooper's
        song.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that the songs were released
        in different years (1989 vs 1963) and uses this difference to conclude that
        Lesley Gore's song was released earlier.

        "Poison" was released 26 years after Lesley Gore's "It's My Party". The NO
        answer is based on this time difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct response to whether
        Alice Cooper's "Poison" was released earlier than Lesley Gore's "It's My Party".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that there is a difference in release dates,
        with "Panama" being released about 5 years before "Janie's Got a Gun". This
        difference in values is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
