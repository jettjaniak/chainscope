        based on the instructions, we should not try to resolve this inconsistency
        and should only evaluate what was explicitly stated.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it notes that 1992 is earlier than 2000, which indicates
        a difference in the release dates.
