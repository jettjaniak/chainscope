        The NO answer is based on this difference in publication dates, not on equality.

        the values are the same. It clearly states that In Cold Blood was published
        in 1966 and The Dragon Reborn in 1991, showing a difference in publication
        dates. The NO is because In Cold Blood was published earlier, not because
        the dates are equal.
