      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Thomas Friedman's
        book was published in 2005, while Randy Pausch's book was published in 2008.
        The NO answer is given because 2005 is earlier than 2008, not because the
        dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Randy Pausch's book was released earlier than Thomas
        Friedman's book.

        and concludes that "The World Is Flat" was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that the publication dates are different (1994
        vs 2004) and uses this difference to conclude that one book was not released
        earlier than the other.

        in 1992 and The Amber Spyglass in 2000, indicating a difference in publication
        dates. The NO answer is given because The Amber Spyglass was released after
