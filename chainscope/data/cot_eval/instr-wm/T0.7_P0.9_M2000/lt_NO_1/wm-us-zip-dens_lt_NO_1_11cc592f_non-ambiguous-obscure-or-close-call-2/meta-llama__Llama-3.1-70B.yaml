      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO based on the difference in population
        density between Beverly Hills and Manorville, stating that Beverly Hills is
        more densely populated.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it indicates that New York City (including 10003) has
        an "extremely high population density" while Silicon Valley (94043) has a
        high density but "generally does not match the extreme density of New York
        City". This implies a difference in density, not equality.
