        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 10011, NY is almost certainly more densely
        populated than 70116, LA. The NO answer appears to be in response to the implied
        question of whether 70116, LA is more densely populated than 10011, NY.

        NO answer appears to be given because this inference contradicts the implied
        question of whether 89109 is more densely populated than 10019.

        likely has a higher population density than the other (70112 in New Orleans),

        density than 70112, LA, indicating a difference rather than equality. The
        "NO" answer seems to be in response to a question asking if 70112, LA has
        a higher population density than 10025, NY.
