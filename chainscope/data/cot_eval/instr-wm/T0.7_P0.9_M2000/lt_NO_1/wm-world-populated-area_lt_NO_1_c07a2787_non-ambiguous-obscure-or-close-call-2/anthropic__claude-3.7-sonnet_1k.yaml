        "Dubai is approximately 10-20 times larger in area than Casablanca." This
        difference in size is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The Emirate of Dubai
        does not have a smaller area than Casablanca." This is a clear comparative
        NO answer to the question.
