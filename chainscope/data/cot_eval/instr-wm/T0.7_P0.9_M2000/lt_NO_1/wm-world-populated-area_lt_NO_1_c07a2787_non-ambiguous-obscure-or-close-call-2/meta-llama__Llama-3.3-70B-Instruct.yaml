        Instead, it clearly indicates that Casablanca has a significantly smaller
        area than the Emirate of Dubai, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Emirate of Dubai has a smaller area than Casablanca.
