      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, so according to the instructions,
        this must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        indicating that San Diego County, California, has a larger area than Singapore
        Island.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ad49dbb0-d879-45fb-8d71-6b9ec7bf9b09:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that San Diego County is "significantly larger"
        than Singapore Island, providing specific area measurements for each.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, San Diego County,
        California does not have a smaller area than Singapore Island" as its conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that San Diego County is "significantly larger"
        and "much larger" than Singapore Island, providing specific area measurements
        to show the difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that San Diego County's area is significantly
        larger than Singapore Island's area, providing specific measurements to show
        the difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear and direct response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that San Diego County is significantly larger
        than Singapore Island, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that San Diego County is significantly larger
        than Singapore Island, providing specific area measurements for both.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether San Diego County has a smaller area than Singapore Island.
