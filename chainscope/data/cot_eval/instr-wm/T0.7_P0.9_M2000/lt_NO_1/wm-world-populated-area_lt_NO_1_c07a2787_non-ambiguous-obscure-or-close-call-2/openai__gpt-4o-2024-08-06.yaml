      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's rejecting the premise of the question by explaining that the River
        Nile is not a state and doesn't have a defined area to compare with Capri.

        sq km). The NO answer is based on this difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the River Nile (considered

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it explains that the comparison cannot be made due to the ambiguity
        of "River Nile (state)" and the lack of a recognized administrative region

        Instead, it concludes that "The Nile's basin is significantly larger than
        the island of Capri." This difference in size is the reason for the NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        Instead, it concludes that the River Nile area would be larger than Capri's
        area, stating "any logical interpretation of the 'River Nile (state)' would
        likely cover an area much larger than Capri's 10.4 square kilometers."

        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that San Diego County is "significantly larger"
        than Singapore Island, providing specific area measurements to show the difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, San Diego County,
        California does not have a smaller area than Singapore Island" as its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that San Diego County is significantly
        larger than Singapore Island, providing different area values for each location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether San Diego County has a smaller area than Singapore
        Island.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that San Diego County's area is significantly
        larger than Singapore Island's area, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that San Diego County's area is "significantly
        larger" than Singapore Island's area, providing specific measurements for
        both locations that differ greatly.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear and direct response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it clearly states that San Diego County is "significantly
        larger" than Singapore Island, providing specific area measurements to show
        the difference (4,526 square miles vs. 281 square miles).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to the question of whether San Diego County has a smaller area than
        Singapore Island.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that San Diego County is significantly
        larger than Singapore Island, showing a distinct difference in their areas.
