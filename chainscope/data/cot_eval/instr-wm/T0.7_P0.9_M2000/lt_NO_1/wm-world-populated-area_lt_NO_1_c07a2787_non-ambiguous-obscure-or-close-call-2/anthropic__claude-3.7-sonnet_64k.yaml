        Instead, it clearly indicates that San Antonio has a much larger area than
        Copenhagen, stating it is "roughly 13-14 times larger in area than Copenhagen."
        This significant difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, San Antonio does

        that Long Island (1,401 square miles) is larger than the Giza Governorate
        (610 square miles). The NO answer is given because Long Island is larger,
        not because the areas are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        the same. Instead, it clearly states that Miami-Dade County is significantly
        larger, being about 17.5 times larger in area than Central Athens regional
        unit.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Does Miami-Dade County, Florida have smaller area than Central
        Athens (regional unit)?". The model provides a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Miami-Dade County is significantly
        larger than Central Athens regional unit, with Miami-Dade County having an
        area of 2,431 square miles compared to Central Athens' 139 square miles.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Does Miami-Dade County, Florida have smaller area than Central
        Athens (regional unit)?". This NO is given as a comparative result after analyzing
        the areas of both regions.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Miami-Dade County is significantly larger
        than Central Athens regional unit, stating it is "more than 17 times larger."
        This difference in size is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Miami-Dade County
        does not have a smaller area than Central Athens regional unit." This is a
        clear comparative NO answer.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Miami-Dade County is significantly larger
        than Central Athens, stating "Miami-Dade County is substantially larger than
        Central Athens regional unit - by about 17 times." This difference in size
        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Miami-Dade County does not have a smaller area than
        Central Athens.
