        Instead, it indicates a size difference, noting that River Nile State is "a

        Instead, it reasons that the River Nile state is likely larger than Capri,

        In fact, it explicitly compares the areas and states that Tuscany has a larger

        In fact, it clearly shows that Ireland's area (84,421 sq km) is larger than

        In fact, it explicitly compares the areas and concludes that Ireland has a

        to a question asking if Crimea is larger, though this question is not provided

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly shows that the areas are different (665 square miles for
        Houston vs 6.36 square miles for Shinjuku) and indicates that Houston's area
        is greater than Shinjuku's.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Houston is significantly larger than Shinjuku,
        with Houston being over 1,600 square kilometers and Shinjuku being around
        18 square kilometers. The NO answer is based on this difference in size, not
        on equality.

        It compares the areas and concludes that Greater Orlando (10,000 sq km) is
        larger than the city of Mecca (100 sq km). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Greater Orlando (1,500 square miles) is
        significantly larger than Mecca (12 square miles). The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        In fact, it explicitly compares the areas and states that Greater Orlando
        (10,000 sq km) is larger than Mecca (850 sq km). The NO answer is not due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Greater Orlando (10,000 sq km) is larger
        than Mecca (850 sq km). The NO answer is not due to equal values, but rather
        because Greater Orlando is larger than Mecca, which is the opposite of what
        the original question likely asked.

        In fact, it clearly shows that Los Angeles County (4,083 sq mi) has a larger

        Instead, it clearly shows that the areas are different (4,526 square miles
        > 278 square miles) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that San Diego County (4,526 square miles) is
        larger than Singapore (278 square miles). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Does San Diego County have a smaller area than Singapore?"
