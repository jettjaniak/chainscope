      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that California is further west than
        Illinois, and therefore the University of Chicago is east of Caltech. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response to whether
        the College of the University of Chicago is located west of Caltech.
