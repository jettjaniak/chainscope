      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined University of Chicago is east of Caltech, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a clear directional comparison showing that University of Chicago is east
        (not west) of Caltech.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there

        on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on FSU being east of
        University of Phoenix, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly

        there is a directional difference, noting that "Florida is much further east
        than Arizona" and that FSU is "east of University of Phoenix, not west". The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in the explanation "NO, Florida State University is not located west
        of University of Phoenix" and as a final standalone "NO" answer. The model
        makes a clear directional comparison and provides a definitive negative answer.

        The NO answer was based on a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because

        Florida). The model never suggested the locations were equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Virginia is
        east of Texas and therefore UVA is east of Texas A&M, making the "west of"
        comparison false due to directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Virginia is east of Texas and therefore UVA is east of Texas A&M, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Texas A&M is west
        of UVA (and UVA is east of Texas A&M), indicating a clear directional difference.
        The NO answer was given because UVA is east, not west, of Texas A&M.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis of the locations.
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        explaining that Virginia is east of Texas and therefore UVA is east of Texas
        A&M. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (UVA is east of Texas
        A&M, not west).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference

        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (UVA being east of Texas A&M), not because the locations are the same. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the two
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the geographical positions of the two universities,

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
