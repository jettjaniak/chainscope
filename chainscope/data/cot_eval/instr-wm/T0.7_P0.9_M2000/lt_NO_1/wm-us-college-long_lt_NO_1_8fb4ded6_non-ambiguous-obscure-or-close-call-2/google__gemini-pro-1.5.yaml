      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that the University of Chicago is not west
        of Caltech because Illinois is east of California.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating that the University
        of Chicago is east of Caltech, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It provides a clear directional relationship, stating
        that "Chicago is east of Pasadena." The NO answer is not explained as being
        due to equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that California is west of Illinois,
        and anything in Illinois would be east of anything in California. This directional
        difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Florida is east
        of Arizona based on time zone differences. The NO answer is not due to equal
        values, but rather seems to be an error in the model's logic given its own
        reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning based on time zones
        to conclude that Florida State University is east of University of Phoenix,
        which contradicts its "NO" answer. The model does not give equality as a reason
        for its NO answer.

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that the University of Georgia is east of
        Northwestern University, which indicates a difference in their locations.
        The NO answer appears to be in response to the original question (which we
        don't see here) rather than due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating that the
        University of Georgia is not west of Northwestern University due to their
        relative locations in the southeastern and midwestern United States.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that Texas is west of North Carolina, and
        therefore Duke (in North Carolina) is east of UT Austin (in Texas). This indicates
        a difference in longitude, not equality.
