      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explains that Michigan is west of North Carolina,
        and therefore Duke University (in NC) must be east of the University of Michigan
        College of Engineering (in MI), not west. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

    c0e1e5ef-7802-49dc-9530-a31ef69170c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it clearly explains that the University of Virginia is
        east of Texas A&M University, not west. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the University of Virginia is located west of Texas
        A&M University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the universities are in different
        locations, with UVA being east of Texas A&M. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Virginia is "significantly
        east of Texas" and that UVA is located EAST of Texas A&M University, not west.
