      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Berlin and Queens are at different\
        \ longitudes (13.4\xB0 E and 73.8\xB0 W respectively) and concludes that Berlin\
        \ is east of Queens, not west."
