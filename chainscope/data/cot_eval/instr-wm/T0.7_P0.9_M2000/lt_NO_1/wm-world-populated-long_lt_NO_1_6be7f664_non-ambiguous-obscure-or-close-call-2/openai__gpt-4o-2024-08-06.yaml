      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that one of the locations ("Australia,
        Cuba") doesn't exist as a single place, making the comparison impossible.
        This is not a case of equal values, but rather an inability to compare due
        to the non-existence of one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        Although it explains that the comparison is not possible due to the non-existence
        of "Australia, Cuba" as a single location, it still provides a definitive
        "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or stating it's unknown.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model states that "Australia, Cuba" is not
        a recognized place, and therefore the comparison cannot be made. This is not
        a case of equal values, but rather a rejection of the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. Although it explains that the comparison
        cannot be made due to "Australia, Cuba" not being a valid location, the model
        still gives a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        uncertainty.

        Texas". These are directional differences, even if based on potentially incorrect
        premises.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it notes that Queens is located further west compared
        to Berlin, giving different longitude values for each location.
