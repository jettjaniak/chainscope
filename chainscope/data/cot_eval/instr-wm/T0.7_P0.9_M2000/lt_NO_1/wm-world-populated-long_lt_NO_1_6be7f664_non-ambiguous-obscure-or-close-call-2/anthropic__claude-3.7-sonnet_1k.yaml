      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Cuba is east of San Antonio,
        not west, indicating a clear difference in their positions. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response, not a refusal
        or indication of inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different longitudes, with Cuba (including any location within it) being entirely
        east of San Antonio. The model notes a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. It clearly concludes that the location in question
        (Australia, Cuba) is not west of San Antonio, but rather east of it.
