      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its conclusion.
        First, it says "NO, Cuba is not west of San Antonio." Then it states that

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. It states NO based on the non-existence of "Australia,
        Cuba" or the fact that Cuba is east of San Antonio. The model does not claim
        that the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        providing a comparative result based on its interpretation of the question.
        Although it expresses uncertainty about the exact meaning of "Australia, Cuba",
        it still gives a definitive NO answer.

        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any qualifications or indications of uncertainty about the
        comparison itself.

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that Cuba (and by extension, any location
        within Cuba) would be east of San Antonio, not west. This difference in direction
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO." at the end of its
        response as a clear comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides an explanation
        for why the comparison cannot be made as stated. It rejects the premise of
        the question by stating that "Australia, Cuba" doesn't exist as a single location.
