      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Punta Cana is east/southeast of Los Angeles County, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Punta
        Cana is explicitly stated to be east of Los Angeles County, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Punta Cana being
        east/southeast of Los Angeles County, not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Punta Cana is east of Los Angeles County), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations.

        on a directional difference, not equality of positions.

        on the opposite directional relationship (east instead of west), not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Mecca was determined to be east of Sicily (showing a difference in position).

        is east of Great Britain, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on the direction being opposite to what was asked (east instead of west),

        in position ("Capri is actually east of Great Britain, not west").

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was because Manchester
        was found to be east of the Upper West Side (indicating a difference in position).
        The model explicitly states "Manchester is east of the Upper West Side, not
        west."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based on finding that
        Manchester is east (not west) of the Upper West Side.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison "doesn't
        make practical sense" because they are on different continents separated by
        an ocean. The model argues that the concept of "west" doesn't apply in this
        case, not that the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO". While it explains that the comparison doesn''t make practical
        sense, it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        Manchester is east of the Upper West Side. The NO is based on the opposite
        being true (Manchester being east, not west).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Transylvania
        is explicitly stated to be east (not west) of Greater Boston, indicating a
        clear directional difference

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Transylvania is east of the United States/Greater Boston, indicating
        a directional difference. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion stating "The answer is NO, Transylvania is not located
        west of Greater Boston" and again as a final "NO" at the end. This is a clear
        negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Transylvania being
        east of Greater Boston, not because the locations are at the same position.

        one in US) with Transylvania being east of Greater Boston.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that Transylvania is east
        of Greater Boston, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because
        the premise (west of) is opposite to the actual relative position (east of).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on geographical
        position (stating that Transylvania is east, not west, of Greater Boston).

        is "east of Boston" and "much further east (across the Atlantic Ocean)" -
        not because the locations are at equal positions. The model explicitly notes
        a difference in position (east vs west) rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Transylvania
        is east of Boston and "thousands of miles east of Boston." The NO is based
        on the fact that one location is distinctly east of the other, not because
        they are at the same location or longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
