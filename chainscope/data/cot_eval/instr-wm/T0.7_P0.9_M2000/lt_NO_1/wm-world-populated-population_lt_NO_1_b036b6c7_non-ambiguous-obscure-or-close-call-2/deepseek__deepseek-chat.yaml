        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.

        (37 million) is significantly larger than Brussels' population (1.2 million
        or 2.5 million). The NO answer is given because Tokyo is more populous, not
        because the populations are equal.

        population (4.3 million) than Pyongyang (3.2 million). The NO answer is given
        because Bali is more populous, not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Bali less populous than Pyongyang?" The model provides
        a clear comparative result, stating that Bali is not less populous than Pyongyang,

        In fact, it clearly indicates that Punjab (140 million) is more populous than
