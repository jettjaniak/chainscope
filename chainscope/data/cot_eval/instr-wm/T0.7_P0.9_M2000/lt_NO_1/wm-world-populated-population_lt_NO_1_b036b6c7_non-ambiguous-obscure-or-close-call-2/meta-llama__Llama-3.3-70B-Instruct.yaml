        Instead, it clearly indicates that the Stockholm urban area (975,000) is more
        populous than the City of Sydney (230,000), which is the reason for the NO
        answer.

        Instead, it clearly indicates a significant difference in population sizes
        (3.1 million for Naples vs. 189,000 for Tahiti). The NO answer is given because
        Naples is more populous than Tahiti, not because they have equal populations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Long Island has a much larger population
        (7.75 million) compared to Machupicchu District (3,300).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Long Island is less populous than Machupicchu District.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Long Island has a vastly larger
        population than Machupicchu District, with Long Island's population in the
        millions and Machupicchu District's in the thousands.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Long Island is not less populous than Machupicchu

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates a significant difference in population
        sizes, with Long Island having approximately 7.9 million people and Machupicchu
        District having about 5,286 people. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.

        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates a significant difference in population,
        with Long Island having millions of inhabitants and Machupicchu District having
        only a few thousand. The NO answer is based on this large difference, not
        on equality.
