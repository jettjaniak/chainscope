      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Fenway Park
        is north of Mount Carmel Center, indicating a difference in location
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Fenway Park is not south of Mount
        Carmel Center (because it is north)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Fenway Park is explicitly stated to be north of Mount Carmel Center, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Fenway Park
        is south of Mount Carmel Center. The model states it is "actually north" instead.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Fenway Park being north while the question asked about south), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference in location, with one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis that Fenway
        Park is north (not south) of Mount Carmel Center.'

        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that Fenway Park is north of Mount Carmel Center,
        not south. This is a clear directional comparison with a definitive NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that the Hollywood Sign
        is "north and west of Lakewood Church," indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that "The Hollywood Sign is NOT
        located south of Lakewood Church." The answer is explicit and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states Los Angeles is north
        of Houston and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines that the Hollywood Sign is north of Lakewood
        Church (indicating a difference in position), which leads to its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "So the answer is:
        NO" as its final comparative answer, making this an explicit NO response.'

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on spatial reasoning
        that the Hollywood Sign is north of Lakewood Church, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("California
        is west of Texas" and "Hollywood Sign is north of Lakewood Church's latitude").

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because the model
        determined there was a directional difference (Hollywood Sign being north
        and west of Lakewood Church). The model explicitly notes differences in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic comparison
