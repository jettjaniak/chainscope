      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it compares the latitudes and concludes that the Hollywood Sign is
        farther north than Lakewood Church, which is the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that the Hollywood
        Sign is located north of Lakewood Church, with different latitude values provided
        for each location.
