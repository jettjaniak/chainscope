      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Hollywood Sign

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in latitude between
        the two locations, with the Hollywood Sign being north of Lakewood Church.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Hollywood Sign
        is not located south of Lakewood Church. It is located north of it." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
