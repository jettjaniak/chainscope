        answer, directly addressing the question of whether the Hollywood Sign is
        south of Lakewood Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        we automatically classify this as False for question 2.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and does not provide a
        final YES/NO answer or any conclusion about the relative positions of the
        Hollywood Sign and Lakewood Church. The model only begins to identify the
        locations but does not complete the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values are equal.\
        \ Instead, it provides specific different latitude values for each location\
        \ (34.1342\xB0 N for Hollywood Sign and 29.7353\xB0 N for Lakewood Church)\
        \ and uses this difference to justify its NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as the final answer

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are the same. Instead, it provides specific latitude values (34.1343\xB0\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Hollywood Sign is located south of Lakewood Church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that the Hollywood Sign is located
        north of Lakewood Church, indicating a difference in their latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
