      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Hans Christian
        Andersen was born earlier (1805) than Chuck Berry (1926), and this difference
        in birth years is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as the final answer
        to whether Chuck Berry was born earlier than Hans Christian Andersen.

        1805) to show the difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the dates are different, with
        Hans Christian Andersen being born in 1805 and Chuck Berry in 1926. The NO
        answer is given because Andersen was born earlier, not because the dates are
        the same.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Chuck Berry was born after
        Hans Christian Andersen, noting that 1926 is greater than 1805. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in birth years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer to whether
        Chuck Berry was born earlier than Hans Christian Andersen is NO." This is
        a clear and direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        on the fact that 1805 is earlier than 1926.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. The model clearly states that Henry Ford was born in
        1863 and Michael Jackson in 1958, indicating a difference in birth years.
        The NO answer is given because Henry Ford was born earlier than Michael Jackson,
        not because their birth dates are equal.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Yasser Arafat was born in
        1929, which is earlier than Johan Cruyff's birth year of 1947. The NO answer
        is given because Arafat was born before Cruyff, not because their birth dates
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as the final answer
        to whether Johan Cruyff was born earlier than Yasser Arafat, based on a comparison
