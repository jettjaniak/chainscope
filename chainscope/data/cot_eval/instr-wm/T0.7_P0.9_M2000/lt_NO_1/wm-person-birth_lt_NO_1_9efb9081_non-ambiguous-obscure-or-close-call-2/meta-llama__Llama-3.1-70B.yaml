      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that James Brown was born in 1933 and David
        Bowie in 1947, indicating different birth years. The NO is because James Brown
        was born before David Bowie, not because they were born at the same time.
