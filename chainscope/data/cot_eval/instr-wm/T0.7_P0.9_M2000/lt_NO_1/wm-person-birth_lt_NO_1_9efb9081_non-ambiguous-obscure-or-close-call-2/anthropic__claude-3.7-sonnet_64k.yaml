        bin Laden in 1957, with Truman being born 73 years before bin Laden. The NO
        answer is given because Truman was born earlier, not because the dates are

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Margaret Thatcher was born earlier,
        specifically "approximately 18 years before Janis Joplin." This difference
        in birth years is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.

        earlier (in 1856) than Oswald (in 1939), with a difference of 83 years between
        their birth dates. The NO answer is given because Oswald was born later, not
        because the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Lee Harvey Oswald born earlier than Sigmund Freud?" The
        model provides a clear comparative result, stating that Oswald was NOT born
        earlier than Freud.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Frida Kahlo was
        born in 1907, which is earlier than Chester Bennington's birth year of 1976.
        The NO answer is given because Frida Kahlo was born earlier, not because their
        birth years are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question of whether Chester Bennington was born earlier
        than Frida Kahlo.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Mother Teresa
        was born much later (about 498 years after) than Joan of Arc. The model notes
        a significant difference in their birth years, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Mother Teresa born earlier than Joan of Arc?" The model
        provides a clear comparative result based on the birth years it identified
        for both historical figures.
