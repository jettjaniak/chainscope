      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Wayne County, MI is located
        east of Harris County, TX, which is a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Kings County is east of Denver
        County, which is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Kings County, NY located west of Denver County, CO?"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
