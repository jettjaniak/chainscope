      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Bronx County is east of San
        Francisco County, not west. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Bronx County, NY is located west of San Francisco County, CA.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Bronx County is
        east of San Francisco County, which is why it cannot be west of it. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explains that the District of Columbia is east of
        Maricopa County, AZ, which is the reason for the NO answer. The model notes
        a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the District of Columbia, DC, is located west of Maricopa County,
