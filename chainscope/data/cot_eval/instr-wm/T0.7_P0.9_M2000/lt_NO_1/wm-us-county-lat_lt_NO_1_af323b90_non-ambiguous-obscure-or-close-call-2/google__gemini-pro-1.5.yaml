        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c0819cf3-4315-42a2-a183-6d1950eed88f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Queens County is
        likely north of Orleans Parish, which implies a difference in location. The
        "NO" answer seems to contradict this reasoning, but we must evaluate based
        solely on what is explicitly stated, not resolve contradictions.

        are equal. Instead, it notes that New York is generally north of Louisiana,
        implying a difference in latitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Queens County is not south
        of Orleans Parish because New York is generally north of Louisiana, indicating
        a difference in latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a logical argument concluding
        that King County, WA is north of Maricopa County, AZ, which contradicts its
        final "NO" answer. The model does not give equality as a reason for its NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Washington is generally north
        of Arizona, which implies a difference in location rather than equality. The
        NO answer is not based on equal values.
