        90028 has more residents (25,000-30,000) than 89109 (10,000-15,000). The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 90028 (Hollywood) likely has
        more permanent residents than 89109 (Las Vegas Strip) due to differences in
        land use and residential development. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        than 89109, NV, based on the characteristics of the areas. The NO answer is
        given because 90028, CA is believed to have a higher population, not because
        the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 90028, CA is not
