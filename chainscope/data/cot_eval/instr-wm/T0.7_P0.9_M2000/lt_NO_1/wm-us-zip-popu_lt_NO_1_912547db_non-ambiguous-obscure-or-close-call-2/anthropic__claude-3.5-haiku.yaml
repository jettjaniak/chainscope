      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a large difference in population
        ("much MORE populous") and provided specific different population numbers
        (2.6 million vs 31,000)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        NO" as its final comparative answer'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it explicitly stated there was a significant difference ("Brooklyn
        has hundreds of thousands of residents" vs "Mashpee has around 14,000-15,000
        residents" and concluded that one was "significantly MORE populous")

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 11201 (22,000) is
        "significantly MORE populous" than 02554 (4,000). The NO answer was given
        because of this difference in values, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        6 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides a direct comparative
        result showing 11201 has MORE residents than 02554, making the "less populous
        than" comparison false.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states that 11201 has "significantly
        MORE people" and provides different population ranges (20,000-25,000 vs 5,000-10,000).
        The NO answer was given because 11201 has a larger, not equal, population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 11201 is less populous than 02554. The model provides
        population estimates and concludes that 11201 has "significantly MORE people
        than 02554" before giving its final "NO" answer.

    b958b874-c1f7-4349-9854-b6b3befab24d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the populations are equal. Instead, the model suggests that 11201 (Brooklyn)
        is more populous than 02554 (Falmouth), indicating a difference in values
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        "11201, NY is NOT less populous than 02554, MA". This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c6b0834e-7afa-421c-8b94-3d65becab4e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that 11201 is "almost certainly more populous
        than 02554" and describes Brooklyn as "much more densely populated than Falmouth".
        The NO answer is given because one area is more populous than the other, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after walking through its reasoning about population
        differences between the two zip codes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 11201 has more population (30,000-40,000)
        than 02554 (10,000-15,000). The NO was based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (11201, NY
        is NOT less populous than 02554, MA)". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population, noting that "Brooklyn's population is vastly larger than Mashpee's
        population" and describes Brooklyn as having "hundreds of thousands of residents"
        compared to Mashpee's "14,000-15,000 residents".
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing
        that Brooklyn (11201) is more populous than Mashpee (02554).'

    e217d06d-1c07-4914-beea-92aa8b7240ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly indicated that 11201 is MORE populous than 02554, describing
        11201 as "densely populated urban area" with "many apartment buildings" compared
        to 02554's "less densely populated suburban/rural area" with "fewer residents".
        The NO answer was due to this difference, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (11201, NY
        is NOT less populous than 02554, MA)". This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations (24,000 vs 4,000) and called it "significantly MORE populous."
        The NO was because 11201 has more residents, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on population numbers
        it cited (24,000 vs 4,000)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 10014 has MORE population
        than 90265, providing different population ranges for each zip code (25-30k
        vs 12-15k)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific population estimates to support
        this conclusion (10014: 25-30k vs 90265: 12-15k)'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined 10014 was
        MORE populous than 90265, indicating a difference in values. The reasoning
        was based on a difference (urban vs. suburban patterns) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a direct comparative answer to whether 10014 is less populous than 90265.
        This is a clear NO response to the comparison.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states that "10014 zip code
        area has significantly more residents than the 90265 zip code area" - indicating
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative response indicating that 10014 is NOT less
        populous than 90265.

    3cbb997b-b818-424b-b98e-7f641beeca48:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (24,000
        vs 12,500 residents) and gives this difference (10014 having more residents)
        as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that 10014 has more residents
        than 90265
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the populations
        are equal. Instead, it concluded that 10014 is MORE populous than 90265, explaining
        that Manhattan is more densely populated than Malibu. The model explicitly
        noted differences in population density and characteristics between the areas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (10014, NY
        is NOT less populous than 90265, CA)" as a clear comparative answer. This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined that 10014 has a higher
        population than 90265, citing differences in density and urban characteristics.
        The model explicitly states that "90265 is likely less populous than 10014."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (10014, NY

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that 10014 is "almost certainly MORE
        populous" than 90265. The NO answer is given because it found one area to
        be more populous than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 10001 has "significantly MORE people"
        (25,000-30,000 residents) than 94027 (7,000-8,000 residents). The difference
        in values is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates

        Instead, it explicitly stated that 10001 has "thousands of residents" and
        is "almost certainly more populous than 94027" which has "a much smaller total
        population." The NO answer was based on 10001 being larger, not on the populations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (10001, NY

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 10013 has more population (25,000-30,000)
        than 70130 (10,000-15,000). The NO is because one value is greater than the
        other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative direction (10013, NY is NOT less populous than 70130,
        LA). This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined 10013 was "almost certainly
        more populous than 70130". The reasoning was based on a difference in population
        density, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (10013, NY
        is NOT less populous than 70130, LA)". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the populations are
        different, with 10013 having 25,000-30,000 residents and 70130 having 10,000-15,000
        residents. The NO answer was given because 10013 has MORE residents, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically indicating that 10013 is NOT less populous than 70130. This is
        a direct comparative answer.

        (25,000-30,000) than 70130 (10,000-15,000). The NO answer was given because
        one population is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that 10013 has more residents than 70130, making this
        a definitive comparative NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that 10013 (24,000) is "significantly
        MORE populous" than 70130 (5,000). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after explaining that 10013 has MORE people than 70130, making this an

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined 10013 was MORE populous
        ("Manhattan zip code (10013) is likely more populous"). Since the NO was due
        to a difference in values rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (10013, NY
        is NOT less populous than 70130, LA)" which is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

        people than 70130 ("Manhattan zip code (10013) is likely to have more people
        than the New Orleans zip code (70130)").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether 10013 is less populous than 70130. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states different population ranges (25,000-30,000
        vs 10,000-15,000) and concludes that "10013 is more populous than 70130".
        The NO answer is based on 10013 being MORE populous, not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (10013 is NOT less
        populous than 70130)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO comparative
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the populations
        are equal. Instead, it suggested that 10013 is MORE populous than 70130, indicating
        a difference in values. The model specifically noted that "Manhattan zip codes
        tend to be more densely populated than New Orleans zip codes."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (10013, NY
        is NOT less populous than 70130, LA)" which is a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "90028 has significantly more residents
        than 89109" and provides reasoning about why one area has more residents than
        the other. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        "90028 is NOT less populous than 89109". This is a clear negative comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a difference in
        populations, specifically stating that "90028 is almost certainly more populous
        than 89109". The model does not state the populations are equal - in fact,
        it explicitly states one is "much higher" than the other. The NO is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (90028 is
        NOT less populous than 89109)". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly stated that 90028 "has a much larger population than
        89109" and provided different population ranges (50,000-60,000 vs under 10,000).
        The NO answer was given because 90028 has more population, not because the
        values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (90028, CA

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its final answer, but not because
        the populations were equal. Instead, it reasoned that 90028 has "much higher
        population" and "significantly more permanent residents" than 89109, making
        them unequal. The NO was because one population was larger than the other,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially said YES but then explicitly corrected
        itself and gave a final answer of NO. We should use the final stated answer.

        (50,000-60,000) than 89109 (10,000-15,000). The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (90028 is

        people than 10011 ("90210 appears to have fewer people than 10011"), indicating
        a difference in values. The NO answer was given because the relationship was
        in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (10011, NY
        is NOT less populous than 90210, CA)". This is a clear NO answer comparing

        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 10024 is "likely to have more
        people" and is "MORE populous than 70112". The NO answer comes from finding
        one area more populous than the other, not from them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 10024 is less populous than 70112. The model makes a direct comparative
