        Instead, it provides specific population estimates (32,000 for 10014 vs. 12,000-13,000
        for 90265) and concludes that 10014 is more populous than 90265. The NO answer
        is given because 10014 is not less populous than 90265, not because they are
        equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that ZIP code 10003 has
        a higher population (about 56,000) than ZIP code 33139 (about 39,000).

        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating that "10003
        has a population roughly 15,000 to 20,000 higher than 33139." This difference
        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that 10003 has a significantly
        higher population than 33139, indicating a clear difference in values.

        of approximately 56,000 while 33139 has a population of approximately 39,000,
        and concludes that 10003 is more populous than 33139.
