      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that 11201 "has significantly more residents"
        than 02554, providing population estimates that differ greatly. This difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 11201, NY is not

        for 90265.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 10014 (NY) is not

        equal. Instead, it concludes that Greenwich Village (10014) likely has a significantly
        higher population than Malibu (90265). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that 10014 (West Village) has roughly
        twice the population of 90265 (Malibu). The NO answer is based on 10014 being
        more populous, not on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 10014, NY is not

        Instead, it concludes that "the New York ZIP code has a higher population"
        and provides estimated population ranges that are different for each ZIP code.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 10014, NY is not
