        Instead, it clearly identifies different population values for the two ZIP
        codes (30,000 vs 20,000) and states that 10003, NY is more populous than 33139,
        FL.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that 10003, NY (27,000) has a higher population
        than 33139, FL (19,000), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 10003, NY is not
        less populous than 33139, FL" as its conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly identifies different population values (22,000 for 10003,
        NY and 9,000 for 33139, FL) and bases its NO answer on 22,000 being greater
        than 9,000.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 10003, NY is not
        less populous than 33139, FL" as its conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that 10003, NY (30,000) is more populous
        than 33139, FL (15,000). The NO answer is given because the comparison shows
        a difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 10003, NY is less populous than 33139, FL. This
        is a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that 10003, NY has a higher population (22,000)
        than 33139, FL (11,000). The NO answer is given because 10003, NY has a higher,
        not equal, population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear and direct response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly identifies different population values for the two zip
        codes (23,000 vs 13,000) and concludes that 10003, NY has a larger population
        than 33139, FL. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating a clear negative comparative result.'
