        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Awaara (1951)
        predates Hera Pheri (2000) by nearly five decades. The NO answer is given
        because Hera Pheri came out much later than Awaara, not because they were
        released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct response to whether

        is after 1972.

        was released in 1978 and Seeta Aur Geeta in 1972, indicating a difference
        in release years. The NO answer is given because Muqaddar Ka Sikandar was
        released later, not because the release dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question of whether Muqaddar
        Ka Sikandar was released before Seeta Aur Geeta.
