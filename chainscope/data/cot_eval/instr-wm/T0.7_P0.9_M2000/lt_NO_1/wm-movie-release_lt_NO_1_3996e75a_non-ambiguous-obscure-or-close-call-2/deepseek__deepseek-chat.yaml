        6 years earlier than Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, indicating a difference in release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Muqaddar Ka Sikandar was released earlier than Seeta Aur Geeta.
        This is a clear comparative result.

        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Andrew Adamson's

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the movies were released
        in different years (2000 and 2019) and concludes that Chhichhore was released
        later than Meet the Parents.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear comparative result.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Meet the Parents was released 19 years
        earlier than Chhichhore, showing a significant difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are the same. It clearly states that "Meet the Parents" (2000)
        was released earlier than "Chhichhore" (2019), indicating a difference in
        release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the values are equal. It clearly states that Wall Street was released after
        Don, indicating a difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values being compared are the same. The model clearly states that 1987
        (Wall Street) is later than 1978 (Don), indicating a difference in release
        dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are the same. It clearly states that Wall Street was released in
        1987 and Don in 1978, showing a difference in release years. The NO is because
        Wall Street was released later, not earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "Don" was released
        earlier than "Wall Street", indicating a difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Wall Street was released
        after Don, giving a specific reason for the NO answer that is not based on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear and direct response to the question.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly identifies different release years (1987
        for Wall Street and 1978 for Don) and states that Wall Street was released
        after Don.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the release dates are different
        (1978 for Don and 1987 for Wall Street) and uses this difference to conclude
        that Wall Street was not released earlier.
