      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 2010/2011 is later
        than 1998, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer was given because
        one value was later than the other, not because they were equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2010 is later than 1998 and
        uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are clearly
        different (2010 vs 1998).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Harry Potter was released
        earlier than The Waterboy. The model provides specific years and makes a clear
        determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different
        (1951 vs 2000) and that one is "much earlier" than the other. The NO is because
        Hera Pheri came later, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, making this a definitive comparative
        NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (1951 vs 2000) and indicates that Awaara came "much earlier"
        than Hera Pheri, with almost 50 years difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Hera Pheri was
        NOT released earlier than Awaara.

    b0153dbb-368f-4dde-b99d-79712351e4e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes they are different with "Hera Pheri was released
        MUCH LATER than Awaara" and specifies the dates as 1951 vs 2000. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Priyadarshan's Hera
        Pheri series was NOT released earlier than Raj Kapoor's Awaara" as its final
        conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a significant difference in release dates
        (Awaara in 1951 vs. Hera Pheri in 2000, "almost 50 years" difference). The
        NO is because Hera Pheri came later, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its step-by-step analysis of release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states "1951 is much earlier than 2000" showing a clear
        difference between the dates. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (1951 vs 2000) and describes them as "much earlier" and "decades
        after." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Hera Pheri was NOT released
        earlier than Awaara. This is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (2012 vs 2004) and that "The Hobbit came later." This difference
        in values is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, supported by its step-by-step reasoning that The
        Hobbit (2012) came after Anchorman (2004).

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2012 is later than
        2004 and uses this difference to conclude NO. The values being compared (2012
        and 2004) are clearly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in the explanation "NO, Peter Jackson's The Hobbit was NOT released
        earlier than Anchorman" and as a final standalone "NO" answer. The model provides
        a clear comparative conclusion.

        values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in release
        dates (2006 vs 1990) and concludes NO because Krrish came "much later" than
        Aashiqui. The NO is based on a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
