      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it clearly identifies that the release years are different
        (2019 vs 2000) and concludes that "Chhichhore" was released after "Meet the

        fact that 2000 is earlier than 2019.

        being released later than Meet the Parents.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that "Don" was released in 1978 and "Wall
        Street" in 1987, and concludes that "Don" was released before "Wall Street".
        The NO answer is based on this difference in release years, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but it's not
        because the values are equal. The model clearly states that 1978 (Don) is
        earlier than 1987 (Wall Street), indicating a difference in release years.
