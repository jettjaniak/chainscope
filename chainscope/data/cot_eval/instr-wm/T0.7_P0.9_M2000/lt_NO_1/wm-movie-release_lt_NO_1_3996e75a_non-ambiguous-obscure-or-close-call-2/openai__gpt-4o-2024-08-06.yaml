        in 1951 and Hera Pheri in 2000, showing a difference in release dates. The
        NO answer is given because Awaara was released earlier, not because the dates

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that "Seeta Aur Geeta" was
        released in 1972 and "Muqaddar Ka Sikandar" was released in 1978, showing
        a difference in release years. The NO answer is given because "Seeta Aur Geeta"
        was released earlier, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." as its final comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. It clearly states different release years (1978 and
        1972) and explains that 1972 is earlier than 1978, which is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, directly addressing the question of whether "Muqaddar Ka Sikandar"
        was released earlier than "Seeta Aur Geeta".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the values are equal. It clearly states that "Seeta Aur Geeta" was released
        in 1972 and "Muqaddar Ka Sikandar" in 1978, showing a difference in release
        years. The NO answer is given because "Seeta Aur Geeta" was released before
        "Muqaddar Ka Sikandar," not because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." as its final conclusion.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that the films were released in different years
        (1972 and 1978), with "Muqaddar Ka Sikandar" being released after "Seeta Aur
        Geeta".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it clearly indicates that the films were released
        in different years (1972 and 1978), and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates different release years (2005
        for "The Chronicles of Narnia" and 1973 for "Bobby"), and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear reason for the NO answer,
        which is that 1973 (Bobby's release year) is earlier than 2005 (The Chronicles
        of Narnia's release year). The values are not equal, and the difference in
        years is the primary reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the release dates are
        different (1972 vs 2004) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Anchorman" was released earlier than "The Godfather." This is
        a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly identifies that Meet the Parents was released
        in 2000 and Chhichhore was released in 2019, noting that 2000 is earlier than
        2019. The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.

        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        (1987 vs 1978) and states that 1987 is later than 1978, which is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Oliver Stone's "Wall Street" was not released earlier

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values being compared are the same. The model clearly states different
        release years for the two movies (1978 for "Don" and 1987 for "Wall Street")
        and bases its NO answer on the fact that 1978 is earlier than 1987.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
