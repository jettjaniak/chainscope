      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that "The Waterboy" was released
        in 1998, which is earlier than "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" (2010/2011).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.

        released in 1978, which is later than "Seeta Aur Geeta" released in 1972.
        The NO answer is due to this difference in release dates, not because they

        (1972 vs 2004) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO." at the end of its
        response as a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly identifies that The Godfather was released
        in 1972 and Anchorman in 2004, and concludes that The Godfather was released
        earlier based on this difference in years.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that 2019 (Chhichhore) is later than 2000
        (Meet the Parents), indicating a difference in values.
