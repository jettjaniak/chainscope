      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that The Waterboy was released
        earlier (1998) than Deathly Hallows (2010/2011), and this difference in release
        dates is the reason for the NO answer.

        The NO answer is based on the fact that The Waterboy was released earlier,
        not because the release dates are equal.

        the values are equal. It states that Awaara was released in 1951 and Hera
        Pheri in 2000, showing a difference in release dates. The NO is because Awaara
        was released earlier, not because they were released at the same time.
