      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. It clearly states that The Waterboy was released
        in 1998, which is earlier than Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2010/2011).
        The NO answer is given because The Waterboy came out first, not because the
        release dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that The Waterboy (1998) was released
        earlier than Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2010/2011). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "The Waterboy" was
        released in 1998, which is earlier than "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"
        (2010/2011). The model notes a difference in the release years and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that "The Waterboy" was not released after "Harry Potter
        and the Deathly Hallows". This is a clear comparative result.

        in 1998, which is earlier than "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" (2010/2011).
        The NO answer is given because of this difference in release dates, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct result of comparing
        the release dates of the two movies.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that the movies were
        released in different years (1998 for The Waterboy and 2010 for Harry Potter),
        and uses this difference to conclude that The Waterboy was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that "The Waterboy" (1998) was
        released before "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" (2010/2011). The NO
        answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on any equality between
        the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. The model clearly states that "The Waterboy" was released
        in 1998, while "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" was released in 2010-2011.
        The model explicitly notes this difference in release years as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that "Awaara" (1951) was released
        approximately 49 years before "Hera Pheri" (2000). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Priyadarshan's Hera
        Pheri series was not released earlier than Raj Kapoor's Awaara." This is a
        clear and direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that the release dates
        are different (1951 for Awaara and 2000 for Hera Pheri) and uses this difference
        to conclude that Hera Pheri was released later, not earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response to whether

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that there is a difference in
        the release dates (1951 for Awaara and 2000 for Hera Pheri), and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Priyadarshan's Hera Pheri series was not released

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the films were released at different
        times (1951 for Awaara and 2000 for Hera Pheri), with approximately 49 years
        between them. The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that there is a significant time
        difference between the release dates (Awaara in 1951 and Hera Pheri in 2000).
        The NO answer is given because Awaara was released earlier, not because the
        dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question "Was Priyadarshan's Hera Pheri series released
