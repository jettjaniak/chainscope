        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in population density between Washington,
        DC (11,000 people per square mile) and Compton, CA (9,000 people per square
        mile). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Queens has a much higher population density
        (21,000 people per square mile) compared to Austin (3,000 people per square
        mile). The NO answer is given because Queens is more densely populated, not
        because the values are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal or the same. In fact, it argues that Queens has a higher population
        density than Austin. The NO answer is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its reasoning that Queens is more densely populated
        than Austin. Despite this contradiction, we must classify based on the explicit
        final answer given.

        Instead, it clearly shows that Nashville has a higher population density (1,453
        people per square mile) compared to Yosemite Valley (less than 170 people
