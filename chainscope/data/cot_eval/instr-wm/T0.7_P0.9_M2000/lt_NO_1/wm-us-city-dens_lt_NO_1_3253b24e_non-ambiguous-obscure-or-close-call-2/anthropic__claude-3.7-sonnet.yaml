      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly shows that Washington, DC has a higher population density
        (10,300 people per square mile) compared to Compton, CA (9,500 people per
        square mile). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

        higher population density (11,000 people per square mile) than San Antonio
        (3,200 people per square mile). The model explicitly notes this difference
        in values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. The model then clarifies that Santa
        Monica is NOT less densely populated than San Antonio, but is actually more
        densely populated.
