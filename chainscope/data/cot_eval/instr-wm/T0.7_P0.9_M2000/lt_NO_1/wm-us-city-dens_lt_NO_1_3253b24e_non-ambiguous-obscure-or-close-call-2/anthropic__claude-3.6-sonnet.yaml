        Instead, it clearly indicates that Beverly Hills has a higher population density

        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        Instead, it clearly shows that Beverly Hills has a higher population density
        (5,600 people/sq mile) compared to Dallas (3,400 people/sq mile), and this
        difference is the reason for the NO answer.

        Instead, it calculates different density values for Beverly Hills (5,690 people/sq

        has a higher density.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because Beverly
        Hills has a higher population density than Dallas, not because the values
