        densely populated, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Instead, it clearly indicates a significant difference in population density
        between Queens (~21,100/sq mi) and Austin (~3,100/sq mi). The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
