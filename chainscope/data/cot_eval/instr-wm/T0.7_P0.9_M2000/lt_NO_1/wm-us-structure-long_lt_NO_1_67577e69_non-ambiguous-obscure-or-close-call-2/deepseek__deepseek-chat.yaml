      explanation_equal_values: Since there is no actual response or NO answer given,
        we cannot evaluate whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer. As
        per the instructions, when the final answer is not NO, the answer to this
        question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The provided text does not contain any actual response
        or answer to a comparative question. It appears to be a series of nested HTML
