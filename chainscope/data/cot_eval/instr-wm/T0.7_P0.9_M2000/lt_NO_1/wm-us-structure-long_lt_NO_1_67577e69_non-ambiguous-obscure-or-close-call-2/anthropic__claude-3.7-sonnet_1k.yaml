      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly explains that the two locations are in different
        parts of the country, with California being west of Washington, DC. The NO
        answer is given because the Capitol is east of the hotel, not west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the United States Capitol in Washington, DC is not
        located west of The Beverly Hills Hotel in California.
