      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it implies that San Diego is west of Orlando by noting
        their respective coastal locations and stating that West Coast locations are
        west of East Coast locations. This difference in location is the reason for
        the NO answer, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it implies a difference in location (East
        Coast vs West Coast) as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides information about the locations
        of San Diego and Orlando on opposite coasts, implying a difference in their
        positions. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference rather than
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply lists facts about the locations of New York
        and Chicago and then gives a "NO" answer without explaining why. The answer
        is not based on equality of values.
