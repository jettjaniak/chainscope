    7117c956-aa34-4234-abdc-fe23f35b8a3e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it determines that 1963 is not earlier than 1725, implying
        a difference in the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative result.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. It compares 1963 to 1725 and concludes that 1963 is not earlier
        than 1725, which implies a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the dates are different (1963
        is later than 1725) and concludes that Oswald died after Peter the Great.
        The NO answer appears to be an error given the reasoning provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as a clear comparative answer.
