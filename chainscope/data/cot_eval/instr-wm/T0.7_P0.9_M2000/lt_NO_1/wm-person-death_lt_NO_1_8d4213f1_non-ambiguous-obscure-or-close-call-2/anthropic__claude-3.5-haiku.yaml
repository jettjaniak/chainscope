      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1725 is earlier than
        1963 and uses this difference to conclude that Piotr I died BEFORE Oswald.
        The NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, indicating that Lee Harvey Oswald did
        NOT die at an earlier date than Piotr I. The answer is definitive and directional.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Asimov died earlier (1992) than Ali (2016). The values are explicitly
        different, not equal, and this difference is the basis for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the dates were different
        (1992 vs 2016) and concluded NO because Asimov died earlier than Ali, not
        because they died on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference in
        dates (1992 vs 2016) and gave NO because Ali died LATER than Asimov, not because
        they died on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Ali died LATER than
        Asimov (2016 vs 1992), showing a clear difference in dates. The NO answer
        was given because Ali died at a later date, not because the dates were the
        same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the dates are
        equal - it explicitly states that Ali died LATER (2016) than Asimov (1992).
        The NO is due to the dates being different, with Ali's death occurring after
        Asimov's
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (Ali died
        LATER than Asimov, therefore NO to whether Ali died earlier)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the dates were equal. The model explicitly showed that the dates were different
        (1992 vs 2016) and stated that "Asimov died in 1992" which was "earlier than"
        Ali's death in 2016. The NO answer was given because the dates were different,
        not because they were the same.

        fact, it explicitly states they are different (2016 vs 1992) and uses this
        difference as the reason for the NO answer. The NO is because Ali died later,
        not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because it found that
        Tolstoy died earlier (1910) than Bennington (2017), not because the values
        were equal. The model explicitly noted different years of death.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different
        (1886 vs 1849) and that Dickinson died LATER than Chopin. The NO is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that the dates are different (Chopin
        1849 vs Dickinson 1886). The NO answer is given because Chopin died earlier
        than Dickinson, not because their death dates were the same.

        1886) and concluded NO because Chopin died earlier than Dickinson. The values
        being compared were clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion of its step-by-step reasoning and once as a final
        standalone answer. This is a clear comparative NO answer based on finding

        (alive vs dead), not an equality. The reason for NO was that one event hasn't
        occurred yet, not that the values were the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the dates are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the dates are different
        (1969 vs 2003) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO is
        based on the fact that Ho Chi Minh died earlier than Johnny Cash, not because
        they died on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion of its step-by-step reasoning and again as a final
        standalone answer. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Ho Chi Minh died
        in 1969 while Johnny Cash died in 2003, indicating a clear difference in dates.
        The NO was because Johnny Cash died later, not because the dates were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear explanation that Johnny Cash died later
        than Ho Chi Minh.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Ho Chi Minh died
        in 1969 while Johnny Cash died in 2003, and the NO is because Ho Chi Minh
        died earlier than Johnny Cash (showing different values, not equal ones).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result showing
        that Johnny Cash died later, not earlier, than Ho Chi Minh.

        earlier (1969) than Johnny Cash (2003). The NO is based on this difference
        in dates, not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the dates
        it analyzed. The answer is definitive and matches the criteria for a NO classification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in timing, with Sun Tzu dying around 496 BCE and Newman dying in 2008, describing
        this as "much later." The NO answer was given because Newman died later, not
        because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Paul Newman did
        NOT die at an earlier date than Sun Tzu.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that the dates are different (2008 vs
        496 BCE) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The NO is
        based on Paul Newman's death being later, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Paul Newman did
        NOT die at an earlier date than Sun Tzu.

        death dates are equal. The model explicitly states that "Saint Patrick died
        much earlier than Poe" and gives specific different dates (461 AD vs 1849).
        The NO is because the premise of the question (Poe dying earlier) is incorrect,

        later, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result to whether Matisse died
        at an earlier date than Earhart. The model shows its reasoning that Matisse
        died in 1954 while Earhart was declared dead in 1939, concluding that Matisse

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference,
        with Anne Boleyn dying "much earlier" in 1536 compared to Thatcher's death
        in 2013.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, supported by a step-by-step analysis showing that

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that 1536 is "much earlier than 2013" and shows the dates are different. The
        NO is based on this difference in dates, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the chronological
        analysis it performed.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        dates are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in dates
        ("1536 is much earlier than 2013") and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer ("Thatcher died much later than Boleyn").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Kid. The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the dates
        it analyzed (1881 vs 1984). The model explains that since Gandhi died LATER,
        the answer is NO to whether she died earlier.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the death dates were equal. The model explicitly states that Kim Jong-il died
        AFTER Adam Smith (2011 vs 1790), and this difference in dates is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparison showing Kim Jong-il
        died after Adam Smith.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the dates were
        equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates this NO is due to inability to verify the comparison due to
        missing information about Nitzsch's death date. Since the NO is explicitly
        stated as being due to inability to determine/verify, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        never reached a conclusion about equality since it couldn't verify one of
        the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it lacks sufficient information
        about Friedrich Nitzsch to make the comparison. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot determine the answer due to missing information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values - it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it lacks sufficient verified

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in dates (2009 vs 2016) and concludes NO because "Cruyff died LATER than Cronkite".
        The NO is based on a difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the death dates and finding that
        Cruyff died later than Cronkite.'

        and Cruyff died in 2016, showing different dates, and concludes "Cronkite
        died EARLIER than Cruyff" as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, after comparing the dates and determining that
        Cronkite died earlier than Cruyff (not the other way around as asked in the
        question).

        that Cruyff died in 2016 while Cronkite died in 2009 - showing different values,
        not equal ones. The NO is based on this difference in dates, not because the
        dates were the same.

        Dickens" and shows different death dates (1870 vs 1957). The NO is based on
        the fact that Bogart died later, not at an earlier date, rather than any equality
        between the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
