      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the dates are different (1981
        is later than 1946) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that H.G. Wells died in 1946 while Bob
        Marley died in 1981, and this difference in dates is the reason for the NO
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. The model clearly states that H. G. Wells died in 1946
        while Bob Marley died in 1981, and concludes that H. G. Wells died at an earlier
        date than Bob Marley.

        1946 while Bob Marley died in 1981, and concludes that H. G. Wells died earlier
        than Bob Marley. The values are different and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear reason for the NO answer,
        which is that H.G. Wells died in 1946 while Bob Marley died in 1981. The values
        being compared (death dates) are different, not the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies different death dates (1981 for
        Bob Marley and 1946 for H. G. Wells) and bases its NO answer on H. G. Wells
        dying before Bob Marley.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that John Locke died
        in 1704, which is significantly earlier than Alfred Hitchcock's death in 1980.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
