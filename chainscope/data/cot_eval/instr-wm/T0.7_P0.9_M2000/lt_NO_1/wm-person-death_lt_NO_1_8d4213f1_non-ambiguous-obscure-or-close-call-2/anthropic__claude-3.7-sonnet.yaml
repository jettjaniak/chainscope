      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that Kim Jong-il died in 2011, which is 221
        years after Adam Smith died in 1790. The model explicitly notes this difference
        in dates as the reason for its NO answer.

        Kim Jong-il died in 2011, indicating a difference in dates. The NO answer
        is given because the question asks if Kim Jong-il died earlier, which is the
        opposite of what the model found.

        in 2011, which is later than Adam Smith's death in 1790 by 221 years. The
        NO answer is given because Kim Jong-il died at a much later date, not an earlier

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the dates are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Andy Warhol died later than Marco Polo,
        stating "1987 comes after 1324 (about 663 years later)". The NO answer is
        based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Andy Warhol did not
        die at an earlier date than Marco Polo." This is a clear and direct NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Marco Polo died earlier (1324)
        than Andy Warhol (1987), and this difference in dates is the reason for the
        NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates a significant difference in the
        dates of death (663 years) and states that Marco Polo died earlier than Andy
        Warhol.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear and direct response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Warhol died later than Marco Polo (by about
        663 years), which is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates a significant difference in the dates (663 years
        apart), with Marco Polo dying much earlier (1324) than Andy Warhol (1987).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, followed by an explanation supporting this answer.
