      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. It states that Asimov died in 1992 and Ali died in 2016,
        which are different years. The NO is because Asimov died first (earlier),
        not because they died at the same time.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Asimov died "over two
        decades before Ali's" death, indicating a significant difference in their
        death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct result of comparing
        the death dates of Muhammad Ali and Isaac Asimov.
