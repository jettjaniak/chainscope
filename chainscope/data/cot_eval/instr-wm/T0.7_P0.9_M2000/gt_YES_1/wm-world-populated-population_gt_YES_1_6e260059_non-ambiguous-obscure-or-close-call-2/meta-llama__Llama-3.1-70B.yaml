        to a specific region or state. This is not an equality comparison, but rather
        an inability to make the comparison due to lack of data for one of the entities.

        we must answer False to this question regardless of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES/NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concluded that "Holland (the Netherlands)
