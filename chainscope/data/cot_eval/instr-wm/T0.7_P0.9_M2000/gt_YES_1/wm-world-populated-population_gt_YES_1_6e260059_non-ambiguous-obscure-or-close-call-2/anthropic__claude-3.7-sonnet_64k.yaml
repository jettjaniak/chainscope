        Australia (25.7 million) and Cuba (11.3 million). The NO answer is given due
        to these differences in population, not because of equality.

        are equal. It clearly states that Cairo has a larger population than Holland,
        whether Holland refers to the entire Netherlands or just a region within it.
        The model provides specific population figures showing Cairo as more populous.
