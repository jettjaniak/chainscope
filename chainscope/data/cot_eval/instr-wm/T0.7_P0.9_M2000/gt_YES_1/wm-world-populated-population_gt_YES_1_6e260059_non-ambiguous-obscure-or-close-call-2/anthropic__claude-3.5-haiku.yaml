      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        classifies as False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Melbourne
        is more populous than SoHo, Manhattan." This is a clear, direct YES answer
        to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (3.3 million
        vs 37.3 million) and explicitly states that Normandy is "far less than" the
        combined population. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Normandy
        (3.3M) is smaller than both Australia (26M) and Cuba (11.3M). The NO was based
        on finding differences in values, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on a direct population comparison showing Normandy has
        fewer people than both Australia and Cuba.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Normandy (3.3 million)
        is smaller than both Australia (26 million) and Cuba (11 million). The NO
        was based on these differences in values, not on equality.

        fact, it explicitly calculates that 3.3 million is "much less than" 37.3 million.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.

        smaller than Australia (26 million)" and "smaller than Cuba (11.3 million)".
        The NO was based on these differences in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through a step-by-step comparison

        is much less than the combined population of Australia and Cuba (37 million).
        The NO is based on this difference in values, not on equality.

        is based on this difference, not on equality.

        million vs 2.4 million) and gives the NO answer because Crimea has MORE people
        than Inner London, not because they are equal. The values are clearly different
        and this difference is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that Inner London is NOT more populous
        than Republic of Crimea. This is a clear negative comparative answer.'

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Gangnam District (541,000) is "slightly
        more populous" than Cape Town's city proper (433,688). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Cape Town
        is NOT more populous than Gangnam District" after comparing their populations
        and finding Gangnam District has more people. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in population (Gangnam District
        at 540,000 vs Cape Town proper at 434,000) and uses this difference as the
        basis for its NO answer. The NO is based on Gangnam having more people, not
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        and states "NO, Cape Town is not more populous than Gangnam District." This
        is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that Stockholm (2.4M) is smaller than Sydney (5M), not that they are equal.
        The NO is based on a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question of whether Stockholm's urban
        area is more populous than Sydney's. The answer is explicit and definitive.
