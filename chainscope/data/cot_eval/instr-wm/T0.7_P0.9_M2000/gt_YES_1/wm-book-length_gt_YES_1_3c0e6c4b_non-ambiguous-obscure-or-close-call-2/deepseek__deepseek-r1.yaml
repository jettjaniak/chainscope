        It clearly indicates that Stephen King's book (845 pages) has more pages than

        about 800-850 pages. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Parts", with specific page ranges given for each book (224-256 for Private
        Parts vs. 333-368 for Quiet). The NO answer is based on this difference in

        has 224 pages while "Quiet" has 333 pages, showing a difference in page counts.
        The NO answer is given because "Quiet" has more pages than "Private Parts",
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Howard Stern's "Private Parts" has more pages than
        Susan Cain's "Quiet". This is followed by a clear explanation of the page
        counts for each book, supporting the NO answer.

        that "Private Parts" has fewer pages (224) than "Quiet" (333). It does not
        state that the values are equal or the same, but rather provides a clear difference
        in page counts as the reason for its NO answer.
