        equal. Instead, it implies that The Dark Tower series, being seven books,
        has a much higher page count than the single book Dianetics. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in page counts, not on equality.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that "The Dark Tower" has more pages (4000+)
        than "Dianetics" (600-700), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Dianetics has fewer pages (approximately
        500) than the entire Dark Tower series (thousands of pages). The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
