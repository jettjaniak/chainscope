        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        needed when the final answer isn't NO.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
