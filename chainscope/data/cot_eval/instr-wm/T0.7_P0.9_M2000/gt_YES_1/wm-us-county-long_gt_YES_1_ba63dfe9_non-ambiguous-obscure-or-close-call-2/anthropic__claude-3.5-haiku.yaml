        being west of Fulton County (indicating a difference in location), not because
        they are at the same location. The model explicitly states "California is
        west of Georgia" and uses this directional difference as the reason for its
        answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Queens County,

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because\
        \ the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference\
        \ in longitude (83\xB0W vs 95\xB0W) and concludes that Wayne County is actually\
        \ west of Harris County, not east. The NO is based on this directional difference,\
        \ not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the longitude coordinates it
        analyzed. The answer is definitive and explicitly states that Wayne County
        is not east of Harris County.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Wayne County is actually
        west of Harris County" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question with "Wayne County is NOT east
        of Harris County."
