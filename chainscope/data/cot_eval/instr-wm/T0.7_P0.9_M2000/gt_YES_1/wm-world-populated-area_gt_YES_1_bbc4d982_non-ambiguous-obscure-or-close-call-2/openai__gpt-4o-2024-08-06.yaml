      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that "River Nile (state)"
        does not exist as a geographic entity, making the comparison impossible. The
        NO answer is based on the impossibility of the comparison, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. Although it explains that the comparison is not
        possible due to "River Nile (state)" not existing, it still provides a clear
        "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal.
        Instead, it indicates that River Nile state is "much larger" than Capri, which
        is described as "relatively small". The NO answer is based on this difference
        in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Capri does not have
        a larger area than River Nile (state)." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal.
        Instead, it explains that the comparison is not applicable because the River
        Nile, as a river, does not have a defined area that can be compared to Capri's
        land area. This is not a case of equal values, but rather incomparable entities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the River Nile does
        not have a larger area than Capri" as its final answer. This is a clear comparative
        NO result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal.
        Instead, it explains that the comparison is not possible because the River
        Nile is a river without a defined area, while Capri is an island with a measurable
        area. This difference in nature, not equality of values, is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the River Nile does
        not have a larger area than Capri" as its final comparative answer.

        to Capri's area. This is not a case of equal values, but rather incomparable
        entities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a comparative result based on the inability to compare the areas
        due to the River Nile not having a defined area like an island.
