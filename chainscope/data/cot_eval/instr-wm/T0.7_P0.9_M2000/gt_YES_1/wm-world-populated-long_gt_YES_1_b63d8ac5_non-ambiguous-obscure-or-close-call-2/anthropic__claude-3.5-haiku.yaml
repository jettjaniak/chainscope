        (stating Tahiti is west of Montreal, not east), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly notes they are in different
        positions and hemispheres.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that "Tahiti is west of Montreal, not east" and provides this directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about Montreal's location relative to

        to determine.

        Greater Boston is actually west of Transylvania. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

        difference, saying "Catalonia is actually west of Greater Orlando." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

        providing a direct comparative result about whether Catalonia is east of Greater
        Orlando. The answer is explicit and definitive.

        Greater Orlando being west of it. The NO answer is based on their relative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES." after its step-by-step reasoning'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that Giza is
        west of Philadelphia County. The NO is based on directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based on its step-by-step reasoning
        that Giza is west of Philadelphia, not east.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Giza is west of Philadelphia County, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Giza is west of Philadelphia
        County, not east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not\
        \ because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different longitude\
        \ values (31.2\xB0 E vs 75.1\xB0 W) and concludes NO because Giza is west\
        \ of Philadelphia County, not because they're at the same location."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that "Giza is NOT
        east of Philadelphia County."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a4ff95ff-555a-4f73-a824-7429fc12eb82:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that "Giza is significantly further
        west than Philadelphia County" and gives this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it as a direct comparative conclusion after its step-by-step
        analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically\
        \ results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model clearly\
        \ showed different longitude values (30.0\xB0E vs 75.1\xB0W) rather than equal\
        \ values."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as the final answer. The response shows
        a clear comparative analysis leading to an unambiguous YES.
