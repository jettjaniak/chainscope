        this answer by stating that "Australia, Cuba" does not appear to be a specific

        the final answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        Instead, it explains that "Australia, Cuba" is not a real place, and therefore
        it cannot determine its position relative to San Antonio. The model rejects

        response, but it's followed by an explanation that indicates it cannot confirm
        the comparison due to a flawed premise. This rejection of the question's premise
        and inability to make a determination classifies as UNKNOWN.
