      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it acknowledges that both Australia and Cuba are east
        of San Antonio individually, but gives a NO answer because they are "very
        far apart geographically" and not together as implied by the question. This
        is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct response to the
        question asked, not as a refusal to answer or an indication of inability to
        determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explains that only Cuba is east of San Antonio,
        while Australia is not, which is the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that one location (Cuba) is
        east of San Antonio while the other (Australia) is not, which is the reason
        for the NO answer. The values are explicitly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer. It clearly explains that while Cuba is east of San Antonio, Australia
        is not, and since the question asks if both are east, the answer is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Australia is east of San
        Antonio, while Cuba is not. The NO answer is given because one part of the
        comparison (Cuba being east of San Antonio) is false, not because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explains that both Australia and Cuba are east of
        San Antonio, but the question asks if "both" are east, implying that the "NO"
        answer is due to the structure of the question rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

        are the same. Instead, it gives different locations for San Antonio, Australia,
        and Cuba, noting that while Cuba is east of San Antonio, Australia is not.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer. This is a clear and direct response to the question.
