        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in release dates (1982 vs 1990)
        and states that The Dark Tower was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly identifies that The Dark Tower was released in 1982 and
        The Eye of the World in 1990, and concludes that 1982 comes before 1990. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.

        compared are the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it found that The
        Dark Tower was published before The Eye of the World (1982 vs 1990).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after going through its step-by-step reasoning.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that The Dark Tower was released
        in 1982 and The Eye of the World in 1990, indicating a difference in release
        dates. The NO answer is given because The Dark Tower was released earlier,
        not later, than The Eye of the World.
