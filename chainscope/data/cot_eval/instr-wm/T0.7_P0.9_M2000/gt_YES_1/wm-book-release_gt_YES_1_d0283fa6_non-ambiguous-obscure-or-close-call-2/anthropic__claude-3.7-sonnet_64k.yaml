        compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that King's book was published
        in 1982, which is earlier than Jordan's book published in 1990. The model
        explicitly notes this difference in publication dates as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct response to whether
        Stephen King's book was released later than Robert Jordan's book.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after careful consideration of the ambiguities in the question. The model
        concludes that comparing the specific book titled "The Dark Tower" (published
        in 2004) to "The Eye of the World" (published in 1990) is the most reasonable
        interpretation, and affirms that 2004 is indeed later than 1990.
