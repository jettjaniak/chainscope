        dates (1982 vs 1990) and states that The Dark Tower was published earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, directly addressing the question of whether The Dark Tower was released

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. The model states that Stephen King's book was published
        in 1982, which is earlier than Robert Jordan's book published in 1990. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in publication dates, not on equality.
