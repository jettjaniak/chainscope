        It clearly indicates that "The Dark Tower" was published in 1982, while "The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (publication
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that King's book was published
        in 1982 and Jordan's book in 1990, with 1982 coming before 1990. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Stephen King's book was not published later than
        Robert Jordan's book.

    bb886b1e-0dcd-4849-bf6a-8b16422640b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that King's book was
        published in 1982, which is earlier than Jordan's book published in 1990.
        The NO answer is given because one date is earlier than the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This NO is given as a direct response to whether
        Stephen King's "The Dark Tower" was released later than Robert Jordan's "The
        Eye of the World".
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (publication
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies that The Dark Tower was published
        in 1982 and The Eye of the World in 1990, and uses this difference to justify
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that The Dark Tower was not released later than The Eye
        of the World. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
