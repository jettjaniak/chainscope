      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. It clearly states that Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro was released
        in 1983 and Andaz Apna Apna in 1994, showing a difference in release years.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly identifies different release years (1983
        and 1994) and states that 1983 is earlier than 1994. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
