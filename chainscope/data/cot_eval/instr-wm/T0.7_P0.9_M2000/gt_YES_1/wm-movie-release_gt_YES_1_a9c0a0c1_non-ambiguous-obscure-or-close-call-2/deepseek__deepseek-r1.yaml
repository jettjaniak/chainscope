      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the movies were released
        in different years (1983 and 1994), and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro"
        was released in 1983, which is earlier than "Andaz Apna Apna" released in
        1994. The model notes a difference of 11 years between the release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it is not because the
        values being compared are the same. The model clearly states that "Jaane Bhi
        Do Yaaro" was released in 1983, while "Andaz Apna Apna" was released in 1994.
        The NO answer is given because the first movie was released earlier, not because
        the release dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. It concludes that "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro"
        was not released later than "Andaz Apna Apna" because it came out over a decade
        earlier.
