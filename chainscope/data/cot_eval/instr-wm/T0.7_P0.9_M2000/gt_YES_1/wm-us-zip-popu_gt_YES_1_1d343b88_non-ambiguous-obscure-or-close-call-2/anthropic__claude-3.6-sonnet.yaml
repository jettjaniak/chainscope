      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. It clearly states that ZIP 10007 has a higher population than ZIP 55425,
        indicating a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, followed by a clarification in parentheses.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it notes that the Manhattan ZIP code 10007 has "significantly
        more residents" than the Bloomington ZIP code 55425, which is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, followed by a clarification that 55425, MN is not more populous than
        10007, NY.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it provides different population ranges for each ZIP code and explicitly
        states that the Manhattan ZIP code has more residents than the Bloomington
        ZIP code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, directly addressing the question of whether 55425 is more populous
        than 10007.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that ZIP code 10007 has a higher population
        (8,000-9,000) than ZIP code 55425 (3,000-4,000), and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, directly addressing the question of whether 55425 is more populous
        than 10007.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that 10012 has more than twice the
        population of 94133, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, followed by a clear explanation of why 94133, CA is not more populous
        than 10012, NY.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that 10012 has more residents (27,000) than
        94133 (25,000), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly shows a difference in population (24,000 < 26,000) and
        uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in population, with 94133 having
        approximately 25,000-26,000 residents and 10012 having approximately 55,000-57,000
        residents. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that 94133, CA is not more populous than 10012, NY.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are the same. It clearly states that 94133 has approximately 24,000
        residents while 10012 has approximately 26,000 residents, and it concludes
        that 24,000 < 26,000.

        the values are equal. It clearly states that 94133 has approximately 24,000
        residents while 10012 has approximately 26,000 residents, and it compares
        these numbers showing 24,000 < 26,000.
