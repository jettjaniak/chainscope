      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, the model concluded NO because it determined

        a difference between the populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model provided reasoning

        the values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, where it found that 10012 has more residents

        on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (94133, CA is NOT more

        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        (35,000 vs 25,000 residents) and concluded that "10012 (35,000) is larger
        than 94133 (25,000)". The NO appears to indicate that the original question
        must have asked if 94133 was larger than 10012.

        conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. The model provides a structured

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 10012 has roughly twice the population
        of 94133. The NO answer is given because 10012 has a larger population, not
        because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (94133, CA is NOT
        more populous than 10012, NY)" as its final answer. This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that the populations are different (22,000 vs 35,000 residents) and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct comparison where
        it determines 10012 has more residents than 94133.

        that 10012 (40,000-45,000 residents) has MORE residents than 94133 (25,000-30,000
        residents), not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states
        there is a difference in population ("10012 has more residents than 94133").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" and "The
        answer is NO, 94133, CA is NOT more populous than 10012, NY." This is a definitive
        comparative NO answer.
