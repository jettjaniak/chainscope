      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        needs to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concluded with an explicit "YES"
        at the end of its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that 10013 is east of
        70130.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a7f52dc4-77eb-40db-a870-221b589fb6f6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that New York City is east of New
        Orleans, and uses this directional difference to reach its conclusion. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        preceded by "Therefore, 10013, NY is NOT east of 70130, LA." This is an explicit
        NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was mentioned (which it wasn't)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly went through a step-by-step analysis
        and explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES" at the end'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.

        after its step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of the two zip codes.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "YES"
        as its final answer after working through the geographical locations step
        by step.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model actually indicates the
        locations are different (one on East Coast, one on West Coast) and attempts
        to make a directional comparison. The fact that its logic is contradictory
        doesn't affect our classification.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." The model makes a clear comparative judgment, though it appears
        to have made a logical error in step 4 (contradicting its own analysis in
