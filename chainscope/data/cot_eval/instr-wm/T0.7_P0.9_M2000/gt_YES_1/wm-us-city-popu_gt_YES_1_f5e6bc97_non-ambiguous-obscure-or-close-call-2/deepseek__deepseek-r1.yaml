      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it provides specific population figures showing that Austin
        (over 960k) has a significantly larger population than Detroit (~639k). The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Detroit is more populous than Austin. This is a clear comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Austin has a larger population than
        Detroit, citing specific population figures to support this conclusion. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question of whether Detroit
        is more populous than Austin.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it provides different population estimates for Detroit (approximately
        630,000) and Austin (exceeds 970,000), indicating a clear difference in population
        sizes. The NO answer is based on Austin having a larger population than Detroit,
        not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question of whether Detroit
        is more populous than Austin.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Austin's population
        (over 960k) is substantially larger than Detroit's (under 640k), indicating
        a significant difference in population sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question of whether Detroit
        is more populous than Austin.
