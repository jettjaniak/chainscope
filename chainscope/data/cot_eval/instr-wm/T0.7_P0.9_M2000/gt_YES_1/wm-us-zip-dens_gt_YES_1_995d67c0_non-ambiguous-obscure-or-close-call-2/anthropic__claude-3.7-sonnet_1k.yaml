      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 90210 is more densely populated than
        11954, indicating a difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 90210, CA (Beverly
        Hills) is more densely populated than 11954, NY (Montauk)." This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

        per square mile for 90028). The NO answer is given because 90028 has a higher

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it provides reasons why 55425 has less residential density
        overall compared to 90265, citing differences in land use and development
        patterns. The NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 55425, MN is not

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that one area (55425) is more densely populated
        than the other (90265), which indicates a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 55425 (Bloomington,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it provides specific population density estimates for each zip code,
        showing that 55425 has a higher density (1,700-2,000 people per square mile)
        compared to 90265 (600-700 people per square mile). The NO answer is given
        because 55425 is more densely populated, not because the values are the same.
