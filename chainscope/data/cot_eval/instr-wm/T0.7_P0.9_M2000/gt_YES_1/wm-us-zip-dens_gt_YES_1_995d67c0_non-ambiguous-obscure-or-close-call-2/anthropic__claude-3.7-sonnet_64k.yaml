      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded that 55425, MN has a lower
        population density than 90265, CA due to the commercial nature of 55425 resulting
        in fewer permanent residents compared to the residential character of 90265.
