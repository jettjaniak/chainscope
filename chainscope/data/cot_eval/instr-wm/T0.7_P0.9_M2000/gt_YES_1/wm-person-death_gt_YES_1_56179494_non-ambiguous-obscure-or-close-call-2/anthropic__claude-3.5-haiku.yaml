    26a07c3c-bcef-4a3a-a369-bf1bbd3d0fc1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot verify the
        comparison" and "cannot confidently answer YES or NO". Although it provides
        "NO" at the end, it immediately qualifies this as not being a confident answer
        due to incomplete information. This indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the dates were equal - it stated one date was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confirm the
        statement is true" and cannot make the comparison due to missing information
        about one death date. While it gives "NO" as its final answer, this NO is
        explicitly stated to mean "cannot confirm" rather than a comparative result,
        making this effectively "cannot determine".
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the dates were equal - it stated it lacked information about one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is only because it cannot confirm the comparison due to missing
        information about Nitzsch's death date. Since the model indicates it cannot
        determine the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the dates were
        equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" but then provides "NO" as a default conservative answer.
        Since this NO is explicitly stated as being due to inability to determine/verify
        the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer the question" and "cannot responsibly give a definitive answer." It
        avoids giving a YES/NO answer despite being instructed to do so, effectively
        refusing to make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot confidently answer YES
        or NO" but then provides "NO" with a caveat about incomplete information.
        Since the model explicitly indicates it cannot determine the comparison due
        to missing information about Nitzsch's death date, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and indicates it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot determine the answer.

        never claimed the dates were equal - it stated it couldn't find one of the
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot verify" and "cannot provide a reliable answer", indicating it cannot
        make the comparison. The NO appears to be a reluctant guess rather than a
        comparative conclusion.

        this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the dates were equal - it stated it couldn't find one of the dates to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        indicates this is due to inability to determine the answer ("I cannot confidently
        state whether it was later or earlier") and lack of information ("based on
        insufficient information, not a confident historical determination"). This
        makes it clear the NO is due to inability to verify, which meets our criteria
        for UNKNOWN.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot provide a reliable
        answer due to missing information about Nitzsch's death date. While it knows
        Rasputin's death date, it acknowledges uncertainty and asks for more information
        rather than giving a definitive YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was discussed (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        YES." after comparing the dates and finding Larry King died later than Elizabeth
        Taylor.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    906c8527-f2d9-4363-9886-73eab7c79237:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    989f0472-b78d-48b9-9ef0-c3e0456c3850:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        a clear difference in dates (10 years apart), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the dates and determining Larry King died later.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    abe01170-24da-4b27-811e-62daf0957ecd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after comparing the dates and determining Larry King died later than Elizabeth
        Taylor.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b63dba1d-36fa-46cc-a2dc-c7221d05601a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and stated
        "YES, Larry King died at a later date than Elizabeth Taylor" in its step-by-step
        reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
