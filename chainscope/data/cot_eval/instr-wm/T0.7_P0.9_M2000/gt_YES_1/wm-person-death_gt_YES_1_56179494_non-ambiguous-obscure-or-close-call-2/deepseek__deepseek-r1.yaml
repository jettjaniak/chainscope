        It considers multiple possibilities and concludes with ambiguity, stating
        "the answer depends on which Peter I is referred to" and "the question is

        are the same. It clearly indicates that Peter I of Serbia died in 1921, which
        is after Franz Ferdinand's death in 1914. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off, but the last complete
        sentence indicates a clear intention to answer NO, comparing Franz Ferdinand
        (d. 1914) to Peter I of Serbia (d. 1921). The model explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO, because Peter I of Serbia died in 1921, which is after 1914."

        1914 and Peter I of Serbia died in 1921, which are different dates. The NO
        answer is given because Franz Ferdinand died earlier than Peter I, not because
        their death dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
