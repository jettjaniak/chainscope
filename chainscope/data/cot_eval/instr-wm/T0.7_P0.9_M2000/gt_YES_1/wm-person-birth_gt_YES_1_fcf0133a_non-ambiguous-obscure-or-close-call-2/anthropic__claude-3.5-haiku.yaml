        that Kim Jong-il was born in 1941 and Whitney Houston in 1963, explicitly
        noting that 1941 is earlier than 1963. The NO is based on a clear difference

        never claimed the values were equal - it simply couldn't determine one of
        them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it cannot make the comparison
        due to missing birth date information. This is a clear case where the model

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine Weber's birth
        year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot responsibly
        answer YES or NO" and expresses uncertainty about making the comparison without
        additional information. This is a clear case where the model refuses to make
        a determination.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and indicates it lacks sufficient information

        never claimed the birth years were equal - it simply stated it lacked information
        about one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information about Weber's birth year.
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal to
        answer.

        Weber's birth year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES

        of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "cannot provide a definitive response." This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison due to insufficient information, specifically
        missing birth date data for one person.

        Victoria was born later (1819) than Louis XVI (1754). Despite this logical
