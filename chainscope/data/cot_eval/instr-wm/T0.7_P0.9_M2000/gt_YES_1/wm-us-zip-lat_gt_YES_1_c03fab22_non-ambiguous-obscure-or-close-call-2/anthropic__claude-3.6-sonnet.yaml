        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the zip codes are in different
        locations, with 10007 being north of 90028. The NO answer is given because
        of this difference in location, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, followed by an explanation that 10007 (NY) is north of 90028 (CA).
        This is a clear comparative result.
