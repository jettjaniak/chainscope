        Instead, it clearly identifies that "The Grudge" has a runtime of 91-92 minutes,
        while "Aashiqui" has a runtime of 149 minutes. The NO answer is given because
        "The Grudge" is shorter, not because the runtimes are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear comparative result indicating that "The Grudge"
