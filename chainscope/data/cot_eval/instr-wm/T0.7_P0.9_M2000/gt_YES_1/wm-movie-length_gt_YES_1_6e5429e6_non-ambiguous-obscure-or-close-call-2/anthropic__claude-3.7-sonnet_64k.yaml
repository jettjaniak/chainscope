      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are the same. The model explicitly states that "Aradhana" has a
        longer runtime (169 minutes) compared to "The Chronicles of Narnia" (143 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that Adamson's longest Narnia film is 150
        minutes while Samanta's Aradhana is 169 minutes, and it concludes NO based
        on this difference (150 < 169).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, both in the detailed reasoning and in the conclusion of the step-by-step
        breakdown.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that "Aradhana" is longer than either of the
        Narnia films, with a specific difference in runtime mentioned (19 minutes
        for the longer Narnia film).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that "Aradhana" has a longer runtime (169
        minutes) compared to either of the Narnia films (143 or 150 minutes). The
        NO answer is given because "Aradhana" is longer, not because the runtimes
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "So my answer is NO"
        at the end of its reasoning, and this is reinforced in the final summary where

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that one runtime (143 minutes) is less than
        the other (169 minutes), and this difference in values is the reason for the
        NO answer.

        minutes) is longer than "The Chronicles of Narnia" (143 minutes or 150 minutes
        for the extended edition). The NO answer is given because "Aradhana" is longer,
        not because the runtimes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer. The response concludes with "Therefore, regardless of which of the
        first two Narnia films directed by Andrew Adamson we consider, the answer
        is NO, Andrew Adamson's "The Chronicles of Narnia" is not longer than Shakti

        of 143 minutes, while "Aradhana" has a runtime of 169 minutes. The NO answer
        is given because 143 minutes is less than 169 minutes, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer. It concludes with "Therefore, Andrew Adamson's "The Chronicles of

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Takashi Shimizu's The Grudge longer than Mahesh Bhatt's
