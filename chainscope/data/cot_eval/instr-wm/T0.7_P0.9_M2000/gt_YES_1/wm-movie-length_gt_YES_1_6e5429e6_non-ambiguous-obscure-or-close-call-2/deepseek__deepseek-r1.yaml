      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that "Aradhana" (161 minutes)
        is longer than "The Chronicles of Narnia" (143 minutes). The inequality of
        these values is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question asked.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    122cf3cb-cb37-497a-9423-d521611932c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"
        has a runtime of 143 minutes, while "Aradhana" has a runtime of 161 minutes.
        The NO answer is given because 143 is less than 161, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the runtime comparison between
        the two films.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    25f4cf32-b7bf-4665-a4ac-4afd85db62ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that Aradhana is longer than The Chronicles
        of Narnia, with a difference of at least 3 minutes (146 vs 143 minutes) or
        potentially more (161 vs 143 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question asked.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2f7ad2a3-c74f-441c-ae92-4b0a67c9471b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that "Aradhana" is longer (168 minutes) than
        "The Chronicles of Narnia" (143 minutes). The NO answer is given because of
        this difference in runtime, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question asked.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4d4b52eb-8d85-4b2e-8e4d-5477a100a4de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that both Narnia films are shorter than Aradhana,
        providing specific runtime comparisons (143 < 161, 150 < 161).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the runtimes of the films.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    613446db-4253-42e3-bb07-9e4348708bd1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        It clearly indicates that "Aradhana" (161 minutes) is longer than "The Chronicles
        of Narnia" (143 minutes), and this difference in runtime is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question asked.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7bfa1ad4-f848-4931-aaa7-4b6f2c00066f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. It clearly states that Aradhana (146 minutes) is longer than
        Narnia (143 minutes) by 3 minutes, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a comparative result based on the runtimes of the two
        movies.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aaf55ef2-ec87-4df0-8658-37ffff7103c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Andrew Adamson's
        "The Chronicles of Narnia" has a runtime of 143 minutes, while Shakti Samanta's
        "Aradhana" has a runtime of 161 minutes. The NO answer is given because 143
        minutes is shorter than 161 minutes, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both immediately after the thinking process and in the concluding statement.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result to the question asked.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c7d7180f-f646-435e-959c-d096c3429278:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        the same. It clearly states that "Aradhana" (161 minutes) is longer than "The
        Chronicles of Narnia" (143 minutes or 150 minutes for "Prince Caspian"). The
        model notes a difference in values and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a comparative result between the two movie lengths.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ee8a7b05-65c6-4b01-bf25-937ef2128941:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. It clearly states that Aradhana (161 minutes) is longer
        than both Narnia films (143 and 150 minutes). The model gives a specific reason
        for the NO answer, which is that the Narnia films are shorter than Aradhana.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning process. This NO is given as a direct comparative
        result between the runtimes of the films.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that Andaz Apna Apna
        (160 minutes) is longer than The Grudge (91-92 minutes), and this difference
        in length is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, both in the thought process and in the formal
        answer section.

        (160 minutes) is longer than The Grudge (92 minutes). The NO answer is given
        because The Grudge is shorter, not because the runtimes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning process. This NO is given as a comparative
        result, indicating that The Grudge is not longer than Andaz Apna Apna.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are the same. It clearly states different runtimes for the two
        movies (92 minutes vs 160 minutes) and uses this difference as the basis for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing runtime estimates for both movies and concluding that Andaz
        Apna Apna is longer than The Grudge.
