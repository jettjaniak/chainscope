        less than the other (161 minutes), indicating a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        Instead, it clearly identifies different runtimes for the two movies (143
        minutes vs 168 minutes) and bases its NO answer on Aradhana being longer than
        The Chronicles of Narnia.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that the runtimes are different, with The Chronicles

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Aradhana (161 minutes) is longer than The
        Chronicles of Narnia (143 minutes), which is the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly notes that both of Adamson's Narnia films
        (143 and 150 minutes) are shorter than Aradhana (161 minutes). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in runtime, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response to whether
        Andrew Adamson's "The Chronicles of Narnia" is longer than Shakti Samanta's
        "Aradhana".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because it found
        Aradhana (161 minutes) to be longer than The Chronicles of Narnia (143 minutes),
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question asked.
