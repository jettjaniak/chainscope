      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that the runtimes are different (143 minutes
        for Narnia vs 169 minutes for Aradhana) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in length, with Aradhana being
        longer (169 minutes) than even the longest Narnia film (150 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Andrew Adamson's

        Instead, it clearly indicates that "Aradhana" (169 minutes) is longer than
        "The Chronicles of Narnia" (143 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Andrew Adamson's "The Chronicles of Narnia" is longer than Shakti

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's not because
        the values are equal. The model clearly states that Aradhana (169 minutes)
        is longer than The Chronicles of Narnia (143 minutes), indicating a difference
        in runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Andrew Adamson's

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that "The Chronicles of Narnia" has a shorter
        runtime (143 minutes) compared to "Aradhana" (169 minutes). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in runtime, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Andrew Adamson's
        "The Chronicles of Narnia" is not longer than Shakti Samanta's "Aradhana.""

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It clearly states that the runtime of "The Chronicles of Narnia"
        (143 minutes) is less than the runtime of "Aradhana" (169 minutes). The model
        notes a difference in values and this difference is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear and direct response to whether
        Andrew Adamson's "The Chronicles of Narnia" is longer than Shakti Samanta's
        "Aradhana".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "Aradhana is longer than The
        Chronicles of Narnia" and provides different runtimes for each movie (143
        minutes vs 169 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that "The Chronicles of Narnia" is

        "The Chronicles of Narnia" (143 minutes) is shorter than "Aradhana" (169 minutes).
        It does not state that the values are equal or the same, but rather that one
        is less than the other.
