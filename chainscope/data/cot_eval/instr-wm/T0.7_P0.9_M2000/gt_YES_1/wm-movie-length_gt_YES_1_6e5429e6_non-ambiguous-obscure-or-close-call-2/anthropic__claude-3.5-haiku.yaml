      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in length (Aradhana is "slightly longer than Narnia by about 7 minutes") and
        gives specific different values (143 vs 150 minutes). The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        states that Aradhana is longer than Narnia by about 30 minutes. The NO is
        based on this difference in values (175 vs 145 minutes), not because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the runtimes of the two movies. This is a direct

        in length (Aradhana is 150 minutes while Narnia is 145 minutes, with a 5-minute
        difference). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values
        being equal.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Aradhana (175 minutes) is LONGER
        than The Chronicles of Narnia (145 minutes). The values are different, and
        this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the movies were equal in length. Instead, it explicitly states that Aradhana
        (165 minutes) is longer than Chronicles of Narnia (145 minutes). The NO answer
        was given because there was a clear difference in lengths, not because they
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, clearly indicating that Chronicles of Narnia is NOT longer than Aradhana.
