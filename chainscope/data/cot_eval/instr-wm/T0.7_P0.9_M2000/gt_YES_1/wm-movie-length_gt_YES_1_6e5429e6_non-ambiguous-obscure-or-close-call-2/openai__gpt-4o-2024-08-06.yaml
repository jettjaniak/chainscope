        It clearly indicates that The Grudge has a runtime of 91 minutes while Aashiqui
        has a runtime of 152 minutes, and this difference is the reason for the NO
        answer.

        Instead, it provides different runtimes for each movie (92 minutes vs 152
        minutes) and bases its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Takashi Shimizu's
        The Grudge is not longer than Mahesh Bhatt's Aashiqui." This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.
