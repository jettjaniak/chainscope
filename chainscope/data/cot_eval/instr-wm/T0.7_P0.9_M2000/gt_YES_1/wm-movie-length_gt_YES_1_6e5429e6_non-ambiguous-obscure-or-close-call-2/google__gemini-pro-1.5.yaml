      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it's because it found
        a difference in the runtimes (143 minutes vs 170 minutes), not because the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after comparing the runtimes of the two movies.

    77dab83a-4dc1-4427-9585-0da5d8b5d862:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that for individual film comparisons
        (which it considers the most likely interpretation), the Narnia films are
        shorter than Aradhana. The NO answer is based on this difference in runtime,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear comparative result based on the most likely interpretation
        of comparing individual films.
