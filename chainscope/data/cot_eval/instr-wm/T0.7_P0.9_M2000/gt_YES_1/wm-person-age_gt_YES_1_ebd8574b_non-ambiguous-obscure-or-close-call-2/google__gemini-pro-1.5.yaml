      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it determines that Grace Kelly died later than Louis XIV,
        implying a difference in their lifespans. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, so according to the instructions,
        this must be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        It states "Likely YES, but possibly NO" and indicates that it's impossible
        to say definitively due to lack of precise information. This ambiguity and
        inability to determine a definitive answer classifies as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (ages at
        death) are equal. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about Alighiero's age
        and states that we can't definitively say who was older. The NO answer is
        not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it indicates that Alighiero's age at death is uncertain and could
        be younger, the same, or older than Bin Laden's. The NO answer is due to this
        uncertainty, not because the values are definitively the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

    9ccd6bb5-257a-493e-bb78-3358b8d000e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that it cannot determine Alighiero's age at
        death due to lack of information, making a comparison impossible. This is
        not the same as stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a6717b89-86ba-4bee-9d13-145cd13a5938:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Alighiero's age is uncertain
        and could overlap with Osama bin Laden's age, but it does not definitively
        state they are equal. The NO answer seems to be given because of this uncertainty
        rather than because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that Alighiero di Bellincione almost certainly
        died younger than 54, which was Osama bin Laden's age at death. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it suggests that Alighiero was likely younger than 54 when he died,
        while Osama was 54. This indicates a difference in their ages at death, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Alighiero's minimum age at death
        (36) is less than Osama bin Laden's age at death (54).

        to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it notes that Ellington died later (1974) than Tolstoy
        (1910) and concludes that Ellington lived longer. The NO answer is not based
        on equal values, but on a comparison showing a difference.

        response, which is a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it provides a logical reasoning that Robert Kennedy died
        earlier than Ferdinand Marcos, and therefore could not have been older at
        their respective times of death. The NO answer is based on this comparison,
        not on equality of values.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly shows that Robert Kennedy died at 42 years
        old, while Ferdinand Marcos died at 71 years old, and uses the inequality
        symbol to show that 42 < 71.
