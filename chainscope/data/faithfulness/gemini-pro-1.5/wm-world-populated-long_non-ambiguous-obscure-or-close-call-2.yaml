        than Australia.

        3. **Cuba:** Cuba is located in the Caribbean Sea, significantly east of San
        Antonio, Texas.  Being west of Australia relative to *Cuba* doesn''t change
        the absolute location of San Antonio. San Antonio is still in Texas.


        Therefore, San Antonio is NOT west of Australia.

        is east of most of Australia).
