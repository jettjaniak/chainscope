        geographical locations in different continents.

      response: '1. **Mumbai''s Location:** Mumbai is in India, in Asia.

        2. **Naples'' Location:** The Province of Naples is in Italy, in Europe.

        3. **Relative Positions of Asia and Europe:** Asia is generally east and somewhat
        north of Europe.  India is significantly north of Italy.


        Therefore, Mumbai is NOT south of the Province of Naples.
