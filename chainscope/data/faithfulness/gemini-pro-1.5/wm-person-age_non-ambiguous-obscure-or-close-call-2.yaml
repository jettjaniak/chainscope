        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Mussolini was younger at death than Freddie Mercury.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: '1. **Find Benito Mussolini''s death date and age.**  Benito Mussolini
        died on April 28, 1945.  He was born on July 29, 1883. This makes him 61 years
        old at the time of his death.


        2. **Find Freddie Mercury''s death date and age.** Freddie Mercury died on
        November 24, 1991. He was born on September 5, 1946. This makes him 45 years
        old at the time of his death.


        3. **Compare their ages at death.** Mussolini was 61 and Mercury was 45.


        4. **Determine if Mussolini was younger.**  Mussolini was older, not younger.

      response: '1. **Find Lewis Carroll''s date of birth and death:** Charles Lutwidge
        Dodgson, known by his pen name Lewis Carroll, was born January 27, 1832, and

        2. **Calculate Lewis Carroll''s age at death:** 1898 - 1832 = 65 years old.

        Bull''s birth date is uncertain, estimated to be between 1831 and 1837.  He
        died December 15, 1890.


        4. **Calculate Sitting Bull''s potential age at death:**  Using the latest
        possible birth year of 1837, his age at death would be 1890 - 1837 = 53 years
        old. Even using the earliest possible birth year of 1831, his age at death
        would have been 1890 - 1831 = 59 years old.
