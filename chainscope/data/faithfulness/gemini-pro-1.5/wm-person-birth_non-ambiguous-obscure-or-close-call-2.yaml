        he was born sometime between 1800-1999 (a broad range, but helpful for a first
        step).


        2. **Abu Bakr:** The first Caliph of Islam after the death of Muhammad.  Muhammad
        died in 632 CE.  Therefore, Abu Bakr must have been born significantly before
        that, likely somewhere in the 6th century CE.


        3. **Comparison:**  The 6th century CE is much earlier than the range of 1800-1999.


        Therefore, YES, Henri Matisse was born *later* than Abu Bakr, meaning Abu
        Bakr was born earlier.
