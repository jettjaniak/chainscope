          2. Houston, Texas is generally east of the Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles,
          California.

          3.  While Houston is at a slightly higher *latitude* than Los Angeles (meaning
          further north if one were to consider only latitude), the vast distance
          eastward makes the "north" designation less relevant geographically.  The
          question implies a more general sense of north.

        4.  "North" implies a higher latitude.  While California extends further north
        than Texas, the question is about the specific locations of these two landmarks.
        Since California is west of Texas, the Hollywood Sign''s position relative
        to Lakewood Church is more west than north.
