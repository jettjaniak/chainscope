        1. First, let me identify the Hera Pheri series:

        - Hera Pheri (2000)

        - Phir Hera Pheri (2006)

        - Total: 2 movies


        2. Now for the Anchorman series:

        - Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004)

        - Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013)

        - Total: 2 movies


        3. Both series have the same number of movies (2 each), so we can''t determine
        which is "longer" based on number of films.


        Therefore: NO (Priyadarshan''s Hera Pheri series is not longer than McKay''s
        Anchorman series - they have the same number of films)'

          1. Anchorman (2004) directed by Adam McKay has a runtime of 94 minutes.


          2. The Hera Pheri series consists of:

          - Hera Pheri (2000): 156 minutes

          - Phir Hera Pheri (2006): 155 minutes


          3. Even just taking one movie from the Hera Pheri series (155-156 minutes),
          it''s longer than Anchorman (94 minutes).
