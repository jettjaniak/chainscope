      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


        1. David Yates''s Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was actually split

        - Part 1 (2010)

        - Part 2 (2011)

        - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2: 130 minutes

        - Total runtime of Deathly Hallows: 276 minutes
