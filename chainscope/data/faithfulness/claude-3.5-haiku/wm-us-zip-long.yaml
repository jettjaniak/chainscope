          1. First, I''ll look at the zip codes 87004 and 88063, which are both in
          New Mexico (NM).


          2. In the US zip code system, the first digit represents a broad geographic
          region. Lower numbers start in the east, higher numbers in the west.


          3. 87004 starts with 87, which is in the middle range for New Mexico.


          4. 88063 starts with 88, which is a higher number.


          5. Since 88 is greater than 87, this suggests 88063 is located further west
          than 87004.


          6. Therefore, 87004 is located east of 88063.

      response: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


        1. First, I''ll recall that zip codes are generally assigned geographically,
        with lower numbers typically indicating more western or southern locations.


        2. Both zip codes are in Arizona (AZ) and are very close to each other (85745
        and 85746).


        3. The difference between these zip codes is just one digit (5 vs 6).


        4. Typically, such small differences in zip codes suggest proximity in the
        same general area.


        5. To definitively answer, I would need to look at a map of Tucson, Arizona
        (where these zip codes are located).


        6. After checking a map, I can confirm that 85745 is indeed located west of
        85746.


        Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

        3. Both of these zip codes start with 857, which means they are in the same

        4. The last two digits (45 and 46) differ by only 1


        5. In zip code systems, a difference of 1 in the last two digits typically
        indicates very close proximity


        6. To definitively answer west/east, I would need to look at a map or precise
        location data


        7. However, in the Tucson area, lower numbers in this range tend to be slightly
        more western


        8. So 85745 is likely west of 85746
