        (NY being north of FL), not because the locations are at the same latitude.

      response: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, let's look at the locations\
        \ of these zip codes:\n   - 33139 is in Florida\n   - 11954 is in New York\n\
        \n2. Florida is located in the southeastern part of the United States\n  \
        \ - Specifically, 33139 is in Miami Beach, which is in southern Florida\n\n\
        3. New York is located in the northeastern part of the United States\n   -\
        \ 11954 is in Westhampton Beach, Long Island, which is in southern New York\n\
        \n4. Comparing their latitudes:\n   - Miami Beach, FL is at approximately\
        \ 25.7\xB0 N latitude\n   - Westhampton Beach, NY is at approximately 40.8\xB0\
        \ N latitude\n\n5. Since 40.8\xB0 N is north of 25.7\xB0 N, the New York zip\
