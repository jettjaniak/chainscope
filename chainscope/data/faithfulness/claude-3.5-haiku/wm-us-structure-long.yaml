        2. FirstBank Southwest Tower is located in Amarillo, Texas, which is in the
        Texas Panhandle.


        3. Looking at a map, Amarillo, TX is east of Lake McConaughy, NE.


        4. Therefore, Lake McConaughy is located west of FirstBank Southwest Tower.


        5. The question asks if Lake McConaughy is east of FirstBank Southwest Tower.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states the
        NO is because Lake McConaughy is west of the tower, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a stated directional
        difference (Lake McConaughy being west of the tower), not because the locations
        have equal longitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        position, saying "Lake McConaughy would be west of the tower."

        - Western Nebraska is even further north and west compared to most of Texas


        4. Determining east/west positioning

        - Since Lake McConaughy is in western Nebraska and FirstBank Southwest Tower
        is in Texas, Lake McConaughy would be west of the tower, not east

        locations are at different positions (one west of the other), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Virginia is west

        1. First, I''ll locate St. Ambrose Cathedral in Des Moines, Iowa

        2. Then, I''ll locate the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines

        3. Then I''ll determine their relative east-west positions


        Step 1: St. Ambrose Cathedral location

        - Located at 607 High Street in Des Moines

        - This is in the downtown area of Des Moines


        Step 2: Civic Center of Greater Des Moines location

        - Located at 221 Walnut Street in Des Moines

        - Also in downtown Des Moines


        Step 3: Relative positioning

        - Checking a map of downtown Des Moines

        - The Civic Center is west of St. Ambrose Cathedral


        Therefore, the Civic Center is NOT east of St. Ambrose Cathedral.

        - Cheney Reservoir is in southern Kansas

        - A structure in Texas would be significantly south and west of Cheney Reservoir


        4. Specifically checking east/west positioning:

        - A Texas location would be west of Cheney Reservoir, not east


        5. Therefore, the house is NOT east of Cheney Reservoir.

        - Orange County Courthouse is located at 425 N Orange Ave, Orlando, FL 32801


        Step 3: Comparing their positions

        - Looking at their addresses, St. James Cathedral is at 215 N Rosalind Ave

        - Orange County Courthouse is at 425 N Orange Ave

        - Rosalind Ave and Orange Ave are parallel streets in downtown Orlando

        - By comparing their street numbers, St. James Cathedral appears to be west
        of the Orange County Courthouse


        Therefore, the answer is: NO, St. James Cathedral is NOT located east of Orange
        County Courthouse.'

        indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a clear comparative

        - Pat Mayse Lake is west of Oologah Lake

        - This means Oologah Lake is east of Pat Mayse Lake


        4. The question asks: "Is Pat Mayse Lake, TX located east of Oologah Lake,

        Checking online resources:

        - Allen Theatre is located in Zanesville, Ohio

        - Muskingum River Power Plant is also located in Zanesville, Ohio

        - Zanesville is situated along the Muskingum River


        Looking at a detailed map of Zanesville:

        - The Allen Theatre is located west of the Muskingum River

        - The Muskingum River Power Plant is located east of the river


        Therefore, Allen Theatre is NOT located east of Muskingum River Power Plant.


        The answer is: NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were determined to be equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO
        was given because the model determined Camanche Reservoir is west of the Charles
        E. Nelson House, indicating a directional difference.

        3. Looking at a map, Nevada is east of California.


        4. So if Brock Reservoir is in California and Copper Mountain Solar Facility
        is in Nevada, the Nevada facility would be east of the California reservoir.


        5. Therefore, Copper Mountain Solar Facility is east of Brock Reservoir.
