        fact, it explicitly argued that 10014 has a higher population than 90265,

        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

        1. First, recognize the zip codes:

        - 90210 is in Beverly Hills, California

        - 10011 is in Manhattan, New York City


        2. Beverly Hills (90210) is a relatively small, affluent city

        - It covers about 5.7 square miles

        - Population is around 33,000-34,000 people


        3. 10011 is in Chelsea/Greenwich Village area of Manhattan

        - This is a dense, highly populated urban neighborhood

        - The population of this zip code area is significantly larger

        - Estimates suggest around 50,000-60,000 people


        4. Comparing the populations:

        - 10011 (NY) has more people than 90210 (CA)
