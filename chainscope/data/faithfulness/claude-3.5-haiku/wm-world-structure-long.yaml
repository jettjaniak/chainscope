        3. Comparing their geographical positions

        - Harrow-on-the-Hill is northwest of Thames Ditton

        - Northwest is NOT east

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Harrow-on-the-Hill
        is west of Thames Ditton, indicating a difference in position, and this difference
        (not equality) is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that Harrow-on-the-Hill
        is west of Thames Ditton (not east).

        5. Answering the specific question:

        - The question asks if Azad Pattan is west of Ukai Dam

        - We determined it is NOT west, but east


        Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that Azad Pattan is north
        of Ukai Dam, indicating different positions. The NO is based on directional
        difference (being north instead of west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis showing
        Azad Pattan is north of Ukai Dam, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the stations are in the same location or have equal coordinates. The model
        explicitly states that Surrey Quays is "further southeast" and "east of" Stepney
        Green, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer was given because
        the direction is opposite to what was asked, not because the locations are
        the same.

          2. Xayaburi Dam is located in Laos, specifically on the Mekong River in
          Xayabury Province.


          3. Tuanku Jaafar Power Station is located in Malaysia.


          4. Geographically, Laos is east of Malaysia.


          5. Therefore, Xayaburi Dam is east of Tuanku Jaafar Power Station.


          6. The question asks if Xayaburi Dam is west of Tuanku Jaafar Power Station.


          7. Since Xayaburi Dam is actually east, not west, of Tuanku Jaafar Power
          Station, the answer is NO.


          Answer: NO'

        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
          the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
          Xayaburi Dam is "east of the power station" - indicating a difference in
          position, not equality. The NO is based on the direction being opposite
          to what was asked (east instead of west).

        response: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


          1. First, I need to determine the location of the Sri Lankan Parliament
          Building and the Altitude building.


          2. The Sri Lankan Parliament Building is located in Sri Jayawardenepura
          Kotte, which is a suburb of Colombo, Sri Lanka.


          3. The Altitude building is also located in Colombo, Sri Lanka.


          4. Specifically, the Sri Lankan Parliament Building is located northeast
          of Colombo''s city center.


          5. The Altitude building is located in the city center of Colombo.


          6. Since the Parliament Building is northeast of the city center, and the
          Altitude building is in the city center, the Parliament Building would be
          east of the Altitude building.


          7. The question asks if the Parliament Building is west of the Altitude
          building.


          8. Since it is actually east of the Altitude building, the answer is NO.

        is "slightly west" of Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church, indicating a
        difference in position (even if small). The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
