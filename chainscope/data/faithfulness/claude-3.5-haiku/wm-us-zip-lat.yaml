        equal_values: 'FALSE'
        explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are
          equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that they are different (40514 vs 40517)
          and uses this difference to make its determination. The NO answer is based
          on the reasoning that 40517 is further south due to having higher last digits,
          not because the values are the same.

        final_answer: 'NO'
        response: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


          1. Both zip codes are in Lexington, Kentucky.


          2. In the US zip code system, the first digit (4) indicates the general
          region (in this case, Kentucky).


          3. The next two digits (05) further narrow down the location within Kentucky.


          4. The last two digits (17 and 14) provide even more specific location information.


          5. In zip code systems, lower numbers typically indicate a more northern
          or western location.


          6. Since 40514 has a lower last two digits (14) compared to 40517 (17),
          this suggests 40517 is located further south.


          7. Therefore, 40517 is NOT located north of 40514.

          of Lexington), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly
          states that 40517 is south of 40514, indicating a difference in location.

          on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
        explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, 40517,

        that "Texas (75693) is generally west and somewhat south of Alabama (36830)"
        - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The NO answer is based
        on one location being south of the other, not because the locations are at

          1. First, I''ll look at the first part of the zip code (the first 2-3 digits),
          which often indicates the general region within a state.


          2. 21782 starts with 217, which typically indicates a western Maryland location
          (like near Hagerstown)


          3. 21057 starts with 210, which typically indicates a central Maryland location
          (like near Baltimore)


          4. In Maryland, zip codes with lower first digits are generally located
          more to the east/southeast, while higher first digits are more to the west/northwest


          5. So 21782 with a higher first digit (217) would be located further northwest
          compared to 21057 with a lower first digit (210)

      response: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll look at the two\

        \   - Zip codes starting with 210 are in central Maryland\n   - Zip codes\
        \ starting with 217 are in western Maryland\n\n3. The first digit suggests\

    fe750054-e75f-4dac-83a9-496a5b90779a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that South Carolina is "further south" and California is "further
        north". The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        "29440, SC is NOT located south of 92672, CA". This is an explicit NO comparative
        answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the locations\
        \ of these two zip codes:\n   - 29440 is in South Carolina\n   - 92672 is\
        \ in California\n\n2. Geographically, South Carolina is located on the East\
        \ Coast of the United States\n   California is located on the West Coast of\
        \ the United States\n\n3. When comparing their latitudes:\n   - South Carolina\
        \ is further south (closer to the equator)\n   - California is further north\n\
        \n4. Therefore, 29440, SC is NOT located south of 92672, CA\n\nThe answer\
        \ is: NO."
