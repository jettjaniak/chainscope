        noting that "Australia is much further west on the globe" and that San Antonio
        is "east of Australia." The NO answer is based on directional differences,
        not equality of positions.

        \ Britain is actually east of Capri\n\nTherefore, the answer is: NO"
      result: 'NO'
    d02628de-7955-4b42-82fc-eb3b6bf08ef9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Capri
        is east of Great Britain and Great Britain is "much further north and west,"
        indicating a clear difference in position. The NO is based on the fact that
        the relative positions are different, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty or
        inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, let's locate Great Britain:\n\
        \u2022 Great Britain is an island located in northwestern Europe\n\u2022 It\
        \ is situated off the northwestern coast of continental Europe\n\u2022 It\
        \ is positioned in the North Atlantic Ocean\n\n2. Next, let's locate Capri:\n\
        \u2022 Capri is an island located in the Tyrrhenian Sea\n\u2022 It is off\
        \ the southwestern coast of Italy\n\u2022 It is in the Mediterranean Sea\n\
        \n3. Consider their relative positions:\n\u2022 Great Britain is much further\
        \ north and west\n\u2022 Capri is much further south and east\n\u2022 When\
        \ comparing their geographical positions, Capri is east of Great Britain\n\
        \n4. Specifically addressing the \"west of\" part of the question:\n\u2022\
        \ Since Capri is east of Great Britain, Great Britain is NOT west of Capri\n\
        \n5. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nNO"
