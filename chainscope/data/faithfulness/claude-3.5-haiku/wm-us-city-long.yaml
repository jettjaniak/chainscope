          is "northeast of Rocksprings" rather than directly east. This indicates
          a directional difference, not equality of positions. The model does not
          state or suggest the locations are equal or the same in any way.

          its final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that St. Lucie Village
        is east of Mannington, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Willow
        Oak is west of Solana, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Willow Oak

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Sunset
        Village is east of Dillonvale, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Sunset Village is actually
        east of Dillonvale, not west"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it as a direct response
        after analyzing the locations.

        - Sunset Village is in southeastern Georgia

        Step 3: Geographic Comparison

        - Without confirmed locations for either place, I cannot determine their relative

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined that Poteau is actually east of Stilwell (opposite of what
        was being asked), indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positions. The
        model explicitly concludes that Poteau is east of Stilwell, not west, making
        this a clear negative comparison.

        Brownsboro Farm.

        Farm.

        1. First, I''ll locate Fortuna Foothills, AZ on a map:

        - It is in southeastern Arizona, near the California border

        - Specifically in Yuma County, near the Arizona-California border


        2. Next, I''ll locate Panaca, NV on a map:

        - Panaca is in southeastern Nevada

        - When comparing their longitude (east-west position), Panaca is further west


        4. Therefore, Fortuna Foothills is EAST of Panaca.

        - Wacousta is in central Michigan

        - Lake Lakengren is in western Ohio

        - Michigan is east of Ohio


        Therefore, Wacousta, MI is east of Lake Lakengren, OH.

        to what was asked (east instead of west).

        locations, so they are not equal.

        - Elmwood, LA is in central Louisiana

        - Louisiana is west of Mississippi


        Therefore, Crenshaw, MS is actually east of Elmwood, LA, not west.

      response: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


        1. First, I''ll locate Carlls Corner, NJ on a map

        2. Then I''ll locate Raubsville, PA on a map

        3. Then I''ll determine their relative positions


        After carefully checking:

        - Carlls Corner is in Hunterdon County, NJ

        - Raubsville is in Northampton County, PA

        - These locations are very close to each other, near the Delaware River

        - When comparing their geographic coordinates, Carlls Corner is actually east
        of Raubsville, not west


        Therefore, the answer is: NO'

        3. Now, let''s compare their relative positions:

        - Hayfork is west of the California-Oregon border

        - Eugene is in western Oregon

        - This means Hayfork is west of Eugene, not east


        4. Therefore, Hayfork is NOT east of Eugene.

        \ coordinates are: 42.3453\xB0 N, 88.4531\xB0 W\n   - Carpentersville's approximate\
        \ coordinates are: 42.1269\xB0 N, 88.2547\xB0 W\n\n4. Comparing their longitude\
        \ (west-east position):\n   - McHenry's longitude (-88.4531\xB0) is further\
        \ west than Carpentersville's (-88.2547\xB0)\n   - This means McHenry is WEST\

        - Nisqually Indian Community is in western Washington

        - Penngrove is in western California

        - Washington is north of California


        4. Determine their relative east-west positioning:

        - Since Nisqually is further north and west compared to Penngrove

        - This means Nisqually is NOT east of Penngrove


        Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Festus is east of Sunset Hills,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positions. The
        answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


        1. First, I''ll locate Festus, MO on a map. It is in Jefferson County, in
        eastern Missouri.


        2. Next, I''ll locate Sunset Hills, MO. It is in St. Louis County, in the
        western part of the St. Louis metropolitan area.


        3. Comparing their locations, Festus is actually east of Sunset Hills, not
        west.


        4. Therefore, the statement "Festus, MO is located west of Sunset Hills, MO"
        is false.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Festus is southeast of Sunset Hills, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and provides a clear comparative reasoning that
        Festus is southeast of Sunset Hills, therefore not west of it.

        County, in eastern Missouri, southwest of St. Louis.


        2. Next, I''ll locate Sunset Hills, MO. Sunset Hills is also in the St. Louis
        metropolitan area, specifically in St. Louis County.


        3. By comparing their locations relative to St. Louis, I can determine their
        east-west positioning.


        4. Festus is southwest of St. Louis, while Sunset Hills is west/southwest
        of St. Louis.


        5. Comparing their specific locations, Festus is actually east of Sunset Hills.


        6. Since the question asks if Festus is west of Sunset Hills, and it is not,
        the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Festus is east of Sunset Hills, not because the locations are at the
        same longitude. It explicitly states a directional difference ("Festus is

        - Sunset Hills is a suburb located in St. Louis County, west of St. Louis

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Festus is southwest
        of Sunset Hills, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because being
        southwest means it's not purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Festus is "NOT west of Sunset
        Hills"

        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Festus is east of

        east rather than west of Sunset Hills.
