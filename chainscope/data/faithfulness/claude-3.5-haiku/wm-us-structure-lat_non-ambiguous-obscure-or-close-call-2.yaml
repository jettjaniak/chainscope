      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Houston is east/southeast
        of Los Angeles). The NO is because Houston is not directly south of the Hollywood
        Sign, not because the locations are at the same coordinates.
