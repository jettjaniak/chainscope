      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Lakewood
        Church is "not directly south" of the Hollywood Sign, as it is east/southeast
        of Los Angeles. The NO is due to directional difference, not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates or elevation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the geographic locations step by step. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        or the same - instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it argues that one location is west of the
        other, and concludes that this means one must be "north" of the other (based
        on map orientation). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        being equal - it explicitly states that the Beverly Hills Hotel is "actually

        NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead
        of south).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states the locations are different,

        relationship is west/east rather than south/north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
