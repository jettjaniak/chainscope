      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude/longitude. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference,
        saying "Japan is much further south than Sweden" and that "Sweden is at a

        (Japan being south of Sweden, not the other way around), not on equality.
