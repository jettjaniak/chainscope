        1. Population density is calculated by dividing total population by land area.


        2. San Antonio, TX:

        - Total population: Around 1.5 million

        - Land area: About 505 square miles

        - Population density: Approximately 3,000 people per square mile


        3. Santa Monica, CA:

        - Total population: Around 90,000

        - Land area: About 8.4 square miles

        - Population density: Approximately 10,700 people per square mile


        4. Comparing the two:

        - Santa Monica has a much higher population density (10,700 vs 3,000 people
        per square mile)

        - This means Santa Monica is more densely populated than San Antonio

        Monica, CA?"
