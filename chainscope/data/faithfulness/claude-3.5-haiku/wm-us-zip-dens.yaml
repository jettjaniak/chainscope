      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES, 85379, AZ
        is LESS densely populated than 48202, MI." This is a clear YES answer to the
        comparison.

          2. For 18237 (Pennsylvania):

          - This is located in Schuylkill County

          - It appears to be a rural area near Tamaqua

          - Rural areas tend to have lower population density


          3. For 61883 (Illinois):

          - This is located near Joliet, which is in the Chicago metropolitan area

          - Areas near large cities typically have higher population density

          - This zip code is in a more urbanized region of Illinois


          4. Comparing the two:

          - The Joliet/Chicago area (61883) is much more densely populated than rural
