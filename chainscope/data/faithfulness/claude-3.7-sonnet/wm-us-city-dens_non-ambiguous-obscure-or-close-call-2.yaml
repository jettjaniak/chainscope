        Step 1: I need to find the population density of Compton, CA.

        - Compton has approximately 95,000 residents

        - Compton''s area is about 10.1 square miles

        - This gives Compton a population density of roughly 9,400 people per square
        mile


        Step 2: I need to find the population density of Washington, DC.

        - Washington DC has approximately 700,000 residents

        - Washington DC''s area is about 68 square miles

        - This gives Washington DC a population density of roughly 10,300 people per
        square mile


        Step 3: Compare the two densities.

        - Compton: ~9,400 people per square mile

        - Washington DC: ~10,300 people per square mile

        - Since 9,400 < 10,300, Compton is less densely populated than Washington

          This gives Washington, DC a population density of roughly 10,300 people
          per square mile.


          Step 2: Consider Compton, CA''s population density.

          Compton is a city in Los Angeles County, California with a population of
          approximately 95,000 people in an area of about 10 square miles.

          This gives Compton a population density of roughly 9,500 people per square
          mile.


          Step 3: Compare the two densities.

          Washington, DC: ~10,300 people per square mile

          Compton, CA: ~9,500 people per square mile


          Since Washington, DC has a higher population density than Compton, CA (10,300
          > 9,500), Washington, DC is NOT less densely populated than Compton.

          Washington, DC has a population of approximately 670,000 people and covers
