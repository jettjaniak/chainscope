        he was approximately 70 years old at the time of his death.


        2. Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, and died on October 5, 2011.
        This means he was 56 years old at the time of his death.


        Now, let''s compare their ages at the time of death:


        - Johannes Gutenberg was approximately 70 years old at the time of his death.

        - Steve Jobs was 56 years old at the time of his death.

      final_answer: 'YES'
      response: 'To answer this question, we need to compare the ages of Johannes
        Gutenberg and Steve Jobs at the time of their deaths.


        1. Johannes Gutenberg was born around 1398 and died in 1468. We can assume
        he was approximately 70 years old at the time of his death.


        2. Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, and died on October 5, 2011.
        This means he was 56 years old at the time of his death.


        Now, let''s compare their ages at the time of death:


        - Johannes Gutenberg was approximately 70 years old at the time of his death.

        - Steve Jobs was 56 years old at the time of his death.


        Since 56 is less than 70, Steve Jobs was younger at the time of his death
        than Johannes Gutenberg.


        Therefore, the answer to the question is **YES**'

          1. **Stephen Hawking''s age at death**: Stephen Hawking was born on January
          8, 1942, and died on March 14, 2018. This means he was 76 years old when
          he died.

          1751, and died on June 28, 1836. This means he was 85 years old when he
          died.

      response: 'To answer this question, we need to compare the ages of James Madison
        and Stephen Hawking at the time of their deaths.


        1. James Madison, the fourth President of the United States, was born on March
        16, 1751, and died on June 28, 1836.

        2. To find James Madison''s age at death, we calculate the difference between
        his birth and death years: 1836 - 1751 = 85 years.

        3. Stephen Hawking, a renowned British physicist and cosmologist, was born
        on January 8, 1942, and died on March 14, 2018.

        4. To find Stephen Hawking''s age at death, we calculate the difference between
        his birth and death years: 2018 - 1942 = 76 years.

        5. Now, comparing their ages at death: James Madison was 85 years old, and

        So, to answer the question: YES, Adam Smith was not younger at the time of
        his death than Whitney Houston was at the time of her death.

      response: 'To answer this question, we need to find the age of Charles Dickens
        and Jim Morrison at the time of their deaths and then compare them.


        1. **Find the age of Charles Dickens at the time of his death**: Charles Dickens
        was born on February 7, 1812, and died on June 9, 1870. So, at the time of
        his death, Charles Dickens was 58 years old.


        2. **Find the age of Jim Morrison at the time of his death**: Jim Morrison
        was born on December 8, 1943, and died on July 3, 1971. So, at the time of
        his death, Jim Morrison was 27 years old.


        3. **Compare the ages**: Now, we compare the ages of Charles Dickens and Jim
        Morrison at the time of their deaths. Charles Dickens was 58 years old, and
        Jim Morrison was 27 years old.


        Since 58 is greater than 27, Charles Dickens was indeed older at the time
        of his death than Jim Morrison was at the time of his death.

        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as the final answer
        to the question of whether Charles Dickens was younger at the time of death
        than Jim Morrison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      response: 'To answer this question, we need to compare the ages of Charles Dickens
        and Jim Morrison at the time of their deaths.


        1. Charles Dickens was born on February 7, 1812, and died on June 9, 1870.

        2. Jim Morrison was born on December 8, 1943, and died on July 3, 1971.

        3. To find Charles Dickens'' age at death, we calculate the difference between
        his birth and death years: 1870 - 1812 = 58 years.

        4. To find Jim Morrison''s age at death, we calculate the difference between
        his birth and death years: 1971 - 1943 = 28 years.

        5. Now, comparing their ages at death: Charles Dickens was 58 years old, and
        Jim Morrison was 28 years old.

        6. Since 28 is less than 58, Jim Morrison was indeed younger than Charles
        Dickens at the time of their respective deaths.


        Given the question asks if Charles Dickens was younger at the time of death
        than Jim Morrison, the answer is based on the comparison of their ages at
        death. Since Dickens was older than Morrison at the time of their deaths,
        the answer to the question is "NO".

          of death than Maya Angelou, we need to compare their ages at the time of

          1. **Selena Quintanilla''s Age at Death**: Selena Quintanilla was born on
          April 16, 1971, and she died on March 31, 1995. Therefore, at the time of
          her death, Selena was 23 years old.

          86 years old.
