      1. First, I''ll find the release date for "I Don''t Wanna Live Forever" by Zayn
      Malik:

      2. Next, I''ll find the release date for "Low" by Flo Rida:

      3. Comparing the two dates:

      - "Low" was released in 2007

      - "I Don''t Wanna Live Forever" was released in 2016


      4. Since 2007 is earlier than 2016, "Low" was released before "I Don''t Wanna

      2. Next, I''ll determine the release date of Neil Young''s "Rockin'' in the
      Free World":

      - This song was released in 1989, on Neil Young''s album "Freedom"


      3. Comparing the two release dates:

      - 1989 (Neil Young) is earlier than 2016 (Travis Scott)


      4. The question asks: Was Travis Scott''s "Goosebumps" released earlier than
      Neil Young''s "Rockin'' in the Free World"?

      - Since 1989 is earlier than 2016, the answer is NO.

      4. The question asks: "Was Kelly Clarkson''s song released earlier than Marvin
      Gaye''s?"

      - Since 2009 is not earlier than 1977, the answer is NO
