      1. The question asks if the United States Capitol in Washington, DC is located
      west of The Beverly Hills Hotel in California.


      2. To determine this, I need to know the relative locations of Washington, DC
      and Beverly Hills, California in terms of longitude (east-west positioning).


      3. The United States Capitol is in Washington, DC, which is on the East Coast
      of the United States.


      4. The Beverly Hills Hotel is in Beverly Hills, California, which is on the
      West Coast of the United States.


      5. In terms of longitude, locations on the West Coast have a higher westward
      position (they''re further west) than locations on the East Coast.


      6. Therefore, Washington, DC (including the US Capitol) is east of Beverly Hills,
      California (including The Beverly Hills Hotel).


      To frame this in terms of the original question, which asks if the US Capitol
      is west of The Beverly Hills Hotel: No, it''s not west of it. The US Capitol
      is east of The Beverly Hills Hotel.</think># Is United States Capitol, DC located
      west of The Beverly Hills Hotel, CA?


      Let me think about this by considering the geographic positions:


      1) The United States Capitol is located in Washington, DC, which is on the East
      Coast of the United States.


      2) The Beverly Hills Hotel is in Beverly Hills, California, which is on the
      West Coast of the United States.


      3) When looking at a map of the United States, Washington DC is positioned far
      to the east, while California is positioned far to the west.


      4) In terms of longitude (which measures east-west position), locations on the
      East Coast have more easterly longitudes than locations on the West Coast.


      Therefore, the United States Capitol in DC is located EAST of The Beverly Hills
      Hotel in California, not west of it.

      step.


      1. The United States Capitol is located in Washington, DC (District of Columbia).

      2. The Beverly Hills Hotel is located in Beverly Hills, California (CA).


      To determine which is further west, I need to consider the geographic locations
      of these two places in terms of longitude. In the United States, locations on
      the west coast are further west than locations on the east coast.


      3. Washington, DC is on the east coast of the United States.

      4. Beverly Hills, California is on the west coast of the United States.


      Since California is on the west coast and DC is on the east coast, The Beverly
      Hills Hotel in CA would be further west than the United States Capitol in DC.


      Therefore, the United States Capitol is NOT west of The Beverly Hills Hotel.
      The Capitol is east of the hotel.


      So my answer is NO.</think>To answer this question, I need to compare the geographical
      locations of the United States Capitol in DC and The Beverly Hills Hotel in
      California.


      Step 1: Identify the general locations

      - The United States Capitol is in Washington, DC, which is on the east coast
      of the United States.

      - The Beverly Hills Hotel is in Beverly Hills, California, which is on the west
      coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions

      - In the United States, locations on the west coast have a more westerly longitude
      than locations on the east coast.

      - California is substantially west of Washington, DC on a map of the United
      States.


      Step 3: Make the determination

      - Since California is on the west coast and DC is on the east coast, The Beverly
      Hills Hotel is west of the United States Capitol, not the other way around.


      NO, the United States Capitol is not located west of The Beverly Hills Hotel.
      It is located east of it.'

      2. The Beverly Hills Hotel in Beverly Hills, California


      To determine if the US Capitol is west of The Beverly Hills Hotel, I need to
      compare their geographical coordinates, specifically their longitudes. In the
      northern hemisphere, a location with a higher (more positive or less negative)
      longitude value is further east. A location with a lower (more negative or less
      positive) longitude value is further west.


      Let me recall the general locations:

      - Washington, DC is on the eastern coast of the United States

      - Beverly Hills, California is on the western coast of the United States


      Since the US spans from the east coast to the west coast, and Washington DC
      is on the east coast while California is on the west coast, the US Capitol (in
      DC) would be EAST of The Beverly Hills Hotel (in CA).


      To be west of something means to be located in a direction toward the west relative
      to that thing. Since DC is east of California, the US Capitol is not west of
      The Beverly Hills Hotel.

      coast of the United States.


      2) The Beverly Hills Hotel is in Beverly Hills, California, which is on the
      west coast of the United States.


      3) When comparing locations in the continental US, places on the east coast
      (like Washington, DC) are east of places on the west coast (like California).


      4) To be "west of" something means to be located in a direction toward the west
      relative to that thing.


      5) Since Washington, DC is on the east coast and California is on the west coast,
      the US Capitol is actually east of The Beverly Hills Hotel, not west of it.

      I need to determine which one is further west. In the US, locations on the west
      coast (like California) are generally further west than locations on the east
      coast (like Washington, DC).


      Washington, DC is on the eastern side of the United States, near the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      California is on the western side of the United States, on the Pacific Ocean.


      Beverly Hills is a city in California, and The Beverly Hills Hotel is in Beverly
      Hills. So The Beverly Hills Hotel is in California, on the west coast.


      The United States Capitol is in Washington, DC, on the east coast.


      Since California is west of Washington, DC, and The Beverly Hills Hotel is in
      California, while the United States Capitol is in Washington, DC, The Beverly
      Hills Hotel is west of the United States Capitol.


      Actually, the question is asking if the Capitol is west of the hotel, not if
      the hotel is west of the Capitol. So I need to reverse my conclusion.


      If The Beverly Hills Hotel (in California) is west of the United States Capitol
      (in Washington, DC), then the United States Capitol is east of The Beverly Hills
      Hotel.


      Therefore, the United States Capitol is NOT located west of The Beverly Hills

      of the United States.

      - The Beverly Hills Hotel is in Beverly Hills, California, which is on the west
      coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their positions

      - The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the
      Pacific Ocean (west).

      - Washington, DC is near the Atlantic Ocean on the eastern side of the country.

      - California is on the Pacific Ocean on the western side of the country.

      - California is west of Washington, DC.

      - Therefore, The Beverly Hills Hotel (in California) is west of the United States
      Capitol (in DC).

      - This means the Capitol is east of the hotel, not west of it.

      To answer this, I need to think about the relative geographic positions of these
      two locations in the United States.


      First, let me recall the locations:

      1. United States Capitol - Located in Washington, DC, which is on the east coast
      of the United States

      2. The Beverly Hills Hotel - Located in Beverly Hills, California, which is
      on the west coast of the United States


      In the United States, when we talk about east and west, we generally mean:

      - East coast: The Atlantic Ocean side (including Washington DC)

      - West coast: The Pacific Ocean side (including California)


      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while Washington,
      DC is located on the east coast. This means that Washington, DC (where the US
      Capitol is) is east of California (where The Beverly Hills Hotel is).


      If Washington, DC is east of California, then the US Capitol (in DC) is east
      of The Beverly Hills Hotel (in CA), not west of it.


      Therefore, the US Capitol is NOT located west of The Beverly Hills Hotel. Rather,
      it''s located east of it.

      of the United States.

      - The Beverly Hills Hotel is in Beverly Hills, California, which is on the western
      side of the United States.

      To answer this, I need to determine the relative locations of these two places
      on a map of the United States.


      First, let me recall the locations:

      1. Fenway Park is a baseball stadium in Boston, Massachusetts.

      2. Mount Carmel Center was a religious community near Waco, Texas.


      Now I need to determine which one is further west. In the US, states that are
      further west have a greater longitude (in the western hemisphere, these are
      negative numbers, but larger negative values are further east).


      Let''s think about the general geography of the US:

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern part of the United States.

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States.


      Generally speaking, Texas is west of Massachusetts. This means that Mount Carmel
      Center (in Texas) is west of Fenway Park (in Massachusetts).


      So, is Fenway Park west of Mount Carmel Center? No, it''s the opposite. Fenway

      - Mount Carmel Center is near Waco, Texas


      ## Step 2: Determine their relative positions on the US map

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      When looking at a US map, Texas is clearly west of Massachusetts. The entire

      step.


      First, I need to determine the locations of both Fenway Park in Massachusetts
      and Mount Carmel Center in Texas.


      Fenway Park is a famous baseball stadium located in Boston, Massachusetts. Boston
      is on the east coast of the United States.


      Mount Carmel Center was a religious compound near Waco, Texas. Waco is in central
      Texas, which is in the central part of the United States.


      Now, to determine which is further west, I need to consider the general east-west
      positioning of Massachusetts and Texas in the United States.


      Massachusetts is on the east coast of the United States, while Texas is in the
      southern central part of the United States. When comparing east-west positioning,
      Texas is definitely west of Massachusetts.


      Since Fenway Park is in Massachusetts (east coast) and Mount Carmel Center is
      in Texas (central US), Mount Carmel Center would be west of Fenway Park. That
      means Fenway Park is NOT west of Mount Carmel Center - it''s east of it.


      So the answer is NO, Fenway Park, MA is not located west of Mount Carmel Center,
      TX. Rather, it''s located east of it.</think># Determining if Fenway Park is
      west of Mount Carmel Center


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      ## Step 1: Locate Fenway Park

      Fenway Park is a famous baseball stadium located in Boston, Massachusetts, which
      is on the eastern coast of the United States.


      ## Step 2: Locate Mount Carmel Center

      Mount Carmel Center was a compound located near Waco, Texas, which is in central
      Texas in the southern United States.


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      When comparing the geographic positions of these locations:

      - Massachusetts is on the East Coast

      - Texas is much further west in the central/southern part of the country

      - Locations in Massachusetts (including Boston) are east of locations in Texas
      (including Waco)


      ## Conclusion

      NO - Fenway Park is not west of Mount Carmel Center. Fenway Park is east of
      Mount Carmel Center.'

      the geographic locations of two places: Fenway Park in Massachusetts (MA) and
      Mount Carmel Center in Texas (TX). Specifically, I need to determine if Fenway
      Park is located west of Mount Carmel Center.


      To solve this, I need to know the approximate longitudes of these two locations.
      In the United States, western locations have larger (more negative) longitude
      values than eastern locations.


      Let me think about where these places are located:


      1. Fenway Park is in Boston, Massachusetts, which is on the east coast of the
      United States.

      2. Mount Carmel Center was in Texas, which is in the southern central part of
      the United States.


      Geographically, the United States has the following rough layout from east to
      west:

      - East Coast (including Massachusetts)

      - Mid-Atlantic

      - Southeast/Midwest

      - Central states (including Texas)

      - Mountain West

      - West Coast


      Based on this general understanding, Massachusetts is significantly east of
      Texas. Therefore, Fenway Park (in Massachusetts) would be east of Mount Carmel
      Center (in Texas), not west of it.


      If we''re looking at a map of the US, we would see Massachusetts on the right
      side (east) and Texas more toward the middle-left (central-south).


      Since the question asks if Fenway Park is west of Mount Carmel Center, and we''ve
      determined that Fenway Park is actually east of Mount Carmel Center, the answer
      would be NO.</think># Is Fenway Park, MA located west of Mount Carmel Center,
      TX?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Fenway Park is in Boston, Massachusetts (MA)

      - Mount Carmel Center was near Waco, Texas (TX)


      ## Step 2: Consider US geography

      Massachusetts is on the East Coast of the United States, while Texas is in the
      south-central part of the country. Moving from east to west across the US, you
      would encounter Massachusetts significantly before reaching Texas.


      ## Step 3: Compare positions

      On a map of the United States, Massachusetts is positioned far to the east of
      Texas. Therefore, Boston (where Fenway Park is located) is east of Waco (where
      Mount Carmel Center was located).


      ## Conclusion

      NO - Fenway Park is not west of Mount Carmel Center. It is east of it.'

      \ answer is NO.\n\nActually, I need to be a bit careful here. The question says\
      \ the George Bush Center for Intelligence is in MD (Maryland), but the CIA headquarters\
      \ (sometimes called the George Bush Center for Intelligence) is actually in\
      \ Virginia, not Maryland. Let me double-check this.\n\nThe CIA headquarters\
      \ was renamed the \"George Bush Center for Intelligence\" in 1999 after former\
      \ President George H.W. Bush. It is located in Langley, Virginia, not Maryland.\
      \ However, Virginia is still on the East Coast, just like Maryland, so my reasoning\
      \ about east-west orientation remains valid.\n\nSo, to answer the question:\
      \ Is George Bush Center for Intelligence, MD located west of Hollywood Sign,\
      \ CA?\n\nNo, the George Bush Center for Intelligence (regardless of whether\
      \ it's in Virginia or Maryland) is on the East Coast, while the Hollywood Sign\
      \ is on the West Coast. Therefore, the George Bush Center is east (not west)\
      \ of the Hollywood Sign.\n\nThe answer is NO.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\
      \nTo determine if the George Bush Center for Intelligence in Maryland is west\
      \ of the Hollywood Sign in California, I need to consider the geographic positions\
      \ of these landmarks within the United States.\n\n1. First, let me identify\
      \ the locations:\n   - The George Bush Center for Intelligence is in Maryland\
      \ (MD), which is on the East Coast of the United States\n   - The Hollywood\
      \ Sign is in Los Angeles, California (CA), which is on the West Coast of the\
      \ United States\n\n2. Looking at U.S. geography:\n   - The United States spans\
      \ from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean (west)\n   - Maryland\
      \ is in the eastern portion of the country\n   - California is in the westernmost\
      \ portion of the country\n\n3. In terms of east-west orientation:\n   - All\
      \ locations in Maryland are east of all locations in California\n   - Something\
      \ can only be \"west of\" something else if it has a more westerly longitude\n\
      \nSince Maryland is on the East Coast and California is on the West Coast, the\
      \ George Bush Center for Intelligence is east of the Hollywood Sign, not west\
      \ of it.\n\n# Answer: NO"

      \ are east of California.\n\nTherefore, the George Bush Center for Intelligence\

      \ not west of it.\n\nWait, I think there's a potential confusion in the question.\
      \ The question refers to \"George Bush Center for Intelligence, MD\" but the\

      \ Virginia, not Maryland. However, it's close to the Maryland border, so the\
      \ question might be referring to this location regardless of the state error.\
      \ Either way, both Virginia and Maryland are on the east coast of the United\

      \ George Bush Center for Intelligence in Maryland is located west of the Hollywood\
      \ Sign in California. This can be broken down into geographical reasoning.\n\
      \nLet me first identify each location:\n\n1. George Bush Center for Intelligence\
      \ in Maryland - This is the headquarters of the CIA, located in Langley, Virginia\
      \ (not Maryland as the question states incorrectly). It's on the east coast\
      \ of the United States.\n\n2. The Hollywood Sign in California - This is in\
      \ Los Angeles, California, on the west coast of the United States.\n\nIn terms\
      \ of geographical orientation in the United States:\n- The West Coast (including\
      \ California) is on the western edge of the contiguous United States.\n- The\
      \ East Coast (including Virginia/Maryland) is on the eastern edge of the contiguous\
      \ United States.\n\nLooking at a map of the United States, California is clearly\
      \ west of Virginia/Maryland. This means the Hollywood Sign in California is\
      \ west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence.\n\nConversely, the George\
      \ Bush Center for Intelligence is east of the Hollywood Sign.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ the George Bush Center for Intelligence is NOT west of the Hollywood Sign.\
      \ It's east of it.\n\nActually, let me double-check some facts:\n\n1. The George\
      \ Bush Center for Intelligence: This is indeed the headquarters of the CIA,\
      \ but I need to verify its location. The CIA headquarters is located in Langley,\
      \ Virginia, not Maryland as the question suggests. But regardless, Virginia\
      \ is on the east coast.\n\n2. The Hollywood Sign: This is definitely in Los\
      \ Angeles, California, on the west coast.\n\nEven with the correction about\
      \ the location of the CIA headquarters, the fundamental east-west relationship\
      \ remains the same. Virginia (where the CIA headquarters actually is) is on\
      \ the east coast, and California is on the west coast.\n\nSo the George Bush\
      \ Center for Intelligence (in Virginia) is east of the Hollywood Sign (in California),\
      \ not west of it.\n\nI should note that I believe there's a factual error in\
      \ the question. The CIA headquarters (George Bush Center for Intelligence) is\
      \ in Langley, Virginia, not Maryland. But even if it were in Maryland, Maryland\
      \ is also on the east coast, so the answer would still be the same.\n\nActually,\
      \ let me check if there's another George Bush Center for Intelligence in Maryland\

      \ in Maryland. The CIA headquarters (George Bush Center for Intelligence) is\
      \ located in Langley, Virginia. It's named after George H.W. Bush, who served\
      \ as CIA Director before becoming Vice President and later President.\n\nSo\
      \ assuming the question is referring to the CIA headquarters but mistakenly\
      \ places it in Maryland instead of Virginia, my answer stands: The George Bush\
      \ Center for Intelligence is NOT west of the Hollywood Sign; it's east of it.\n\
      \nTo be absolutely clear: \n- The George Bush Center for Intelligence (CIA HQ)\
      \ is in Virginia, on the east coast.\n- The Hollywood Sign is in California,\

      \ of the Hollywood Sign in California.\n\nTo answer this, I need to determine\
      \ the relative geographic positions of these two landmarks on the east-west\
      \ axis of the United States.\n\nFirst, let me identify what these places are:\n\
      \n1. George Bush Center for Intelligence, MD - This is the headquarters of the\
      \ Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) located in Langley, Virginia (not Maryland,\
      \ but I'll assume the question meant the CIA headquarters). However, let me\
      \ be careful here. The CIA headquarters is officially named the \"George Bush\
      \ Center for Intelligence\" after President George H. W. Bush, and it is located\
      \ in Langley, Virginia, not Maryland. But I'll proceed assuming the location\
      \ in question is indeed the CIA headquarters.\n\n2. Hollywood Sign, CA - This\
      \ is the famous landmark sign located in the Hollywood Hills area of Los Angeles,\
      \ California.\n\nNow, to determine which is further west, I need to consider\
      \ the geographic locations of Virginia/Maryland (East Coast) versus California\
      \ (West Coast).\n\nThe United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east\
      \ to the Pacific Ocean on the west. Maryland and Virginia are located on the\
      \ East Coast of the United States, while California is located on the West Coast.\n\
      \nMoving from east to west across the continental United States, you would go:\n\
      - East Coast (including Maryland/Virginia)\n- Midwest\n- Mountain states\n-\
      \ West Coast (including California)\n\nTherefore, California is located west\
      \ of Maryland/Virginia. This means that the Hollywood Sign in California is\
      \ located west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence (assuming it's in\
      \ Virginia or Maryland).\n\nSo, the George Bush Center for Intelligence is NOT\
      \ located west of the Hollywood Sign, but rather east of it.\n\nWait, let me\
      \ double-check my understanding of the CIA headquarters location.\n\nThe CIA\
      \ headquarters, officially named the George Bush Center for Intelligence, is\
      \ indeed located in Langley, Virginia, which is just outside Washington, D.C.,\
      \ not in Maryland as the question states. However, regardless of whether it's\
      \ in Virginia or Maryland (both East Coast states), the conclusion remains the\
      \ same: it is located east of California, not west of it.\n\nActually, let me\
      \ make sure I'm not making an error. I should verify the exact locations:\n\n\
      The CIA headquarters (George Bush Center for Intelligence) is located in Langley,\
      \ Virginia, near Washington, D.C. on the East Coast of the United States.\n\n\
      The Hollywood Sign is located in Los Angeles, California, on the West Coast\
      \ of the United States.\n\nGeographically, when looking at a map of the United\
      \ States, California is clearly to the west of Virginia/Maryland. The continental\
      \ United States spans from approximately 67\xB0 West longitude (Maine) to 124\xB0\
      \ West longitude (Washington state). Virginia and Maryland are around 77\xB0\
      \ West, while California ranges from about 114\xB0 West to 124\xB0 West.\n\n\
      Since lower (more negative) values of West longitude indicate locations further\
      \ west, California is definitely west of Virginia/Maryland.\n\nTherefore, the\
      \ George Bush Center for Intelligence (regardless of whether it's in Virginia\
      \ or Maryland) is located EAST of the Hollywood Sign in California, not west\
      \ of it.\n\nThe answer is NO, the George Bush Center for Intelligence is not\
      \ located west of the Hollywood Sign.\n\nActually, let me check one more time.\
      \ The question is \"Is George Bush Center for Intelligence, MD located west\
      \ of Hollywood Sign, CA?\"\n\nThe George Bush Center for Intelligence is the\
      \ headquarters of the CIA, which is located in Langley, Virginia, not Maryland.\
      \ But even if we assume there is a facility with this name in Maryland, Maryland\
      \ is on the East Coast while California is on the West Coast of the United States.\
      \ When moving from east to west across the US, one goes from the East Coast\
      \ (including Maryland) to the West Coast (including California). Therefore,\
      \ Maryland is east of California, not west of it.\n\nSo, the answer remains\
      \ NO, the George Bush Center for Intelligence (whether in Virginia or Maryland)\
      \ is not located west of the Hollywood Sign in California.</think># Step-by-Step\
      \ Reasoning\n\nFirst, I need to identify the locations of these two landmarks:\n\
      \n1. **George Bush Center for Intelligence** - This is the headquarters of the\
      \ CIA, located in Langley, Virginia (though the question mentions MD/Maryland).\
      \ It's situated on the East Coast of the United States.\n\n2. **Hollywood Sign**\
      \ - This famous landmark is located in Los Angeles, California, on the West\
      \ Coast of the United States.\n\nNext, I need to determine their relative positions\
      \ on an east-west axis:\n\n- The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean\
      \ (east) to the Pacific Ocean (west)\n- Maryland and Virginia are both East\
      \ Coast states, located near the Atlantic Ocean\n- California is a West Coast\
      \ state, located along the Pacific Ocean\n- When traveling from east to west\
      \ across the continental US, you would pass through the East Coast (including\
      \ Maryland/Virginia) long before reaching the West Coast (California)\n\nTherefore,\
      \ California is located significantly west of Maryland/Virginia. This means\
      \ the Hollywood Sign in California is west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence.\n\
      \n# Answer: NO"

      \ if the George Bush Center is west of the Hollywood Sign.\n\nFirst, let me\
      \ recall the locations:\n\nThe George Bush Center for Intelligence is the headquarters\
      \ of the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) and is located in Langley, Virginia,\
      \ which is near Washington, D.C., on the east coast of the United States.\n\n\
      Wait, the question says the George Bush Center is in Maryland (MD), but I believe\
      \ it's actually in Virginia (VA). Let me double-check. \n\nThe CIA headquarters,\
      \ named the George Bush Center for Intelligence, is located in Langley, Virginia,\
      \ not Maryland. But for the purpose of this question, I'll assume it's referring\
      \ to a location in Maryland that's named after George Bush.\n\nThe Hollywood\
      \ Sign is an iconic landmark located in Los Angeles, California, on the west\
      \ coast of the United States.\n\nNow, comparing their east-west positions:\n\
      - Maryland is on the east coast of the United States.\n- California is on the\
      \ west coast of the United States.\n\nGiven the geography of the United States,\
      \ California (and thus the Hollywood Sign) is west of Maryland (and thus the\
      \ assumed George Bush Center for Intelligence in Maryland).\n\nSo, is the George\
      \ Bush Center for Intelligence, MD located west of the Hollywood Sign, CA?\n\
      \nNo, it's not. The George Bush Center for Intelligence (assuming it's in Maryland)\
      \ would be east of the Hollywood Sign in California, not west of it.\n\nBut\
      \ I should verify this because I'm a bit confused about the George Bush Center\
      \ being in Maryland. Let me re-check.\n\nThe CIA headquarters, officially named\
      \ the George Bush Center for Intelligence, is located in Langley, Virginia,\
      \ which is near Washington, D.C., on the east coast of the United States. It's\

      \ on the east coast, and California is on the west coast. So, a location in\
      \ Maryland cannot be west of a location in California within the continental\
      \ United States.\n\nSo, the answer is NO.\n\nActually, I want to make one clarification.\
      \ Let me think about the U.S. geography more carefully. The United States is\
      \ roughly oriented such that the east coast is to the east and the west coast\
      \ is to the west. \n\nMaryland is on the east coast, near Washington, D.C.\n\
      California is on the west coast.\n\nWhen we say \"west of,\" we mean that one\
      \ location is to the west (towards the Pacific Ocean from the reference point)\
      \ of another location. Since California is on the west coast and Maryland is\
      \ on the east coast, any location in Maryland would be east of any location\
      \ in California, not west of it.\n\nSo, the George Bush Center for Intelligence,\
      \ assuming it's in Maryland, would be east of the Hollywood Sign in California,\
      \ not west of it.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Is George Bush\
      \ Center for Intelligence, MD located west of Hollywood Sign, CA?\" is NO.\n\
      \nActually, I just realized that there's a potential confusion based on the\
      \ exact wording. Let me restate the facts precisely:\n\n1. The George Bush Center\
      \ for Intelligence is the headquarters of the CIA and is located in Langley,\
      \ Virginia, not Maryland.\n2. The Hollywood Sign is in Los Angeles, California.\n\
      3. In terms of east-west orientation in the continental United States, Virginia\
      \ (and nearby Maryland) are on the east coast, and California is on the west\
      \ coast.\n4. Therefore, the George Bush Center for Intelligence in Virginia\
      \ is east of the Hollywood Sign in California, not west of it.\n\nThe question\
      \ asks if the George Bush Center for Intelligence, MD is located west of the\
      \ Hollywood Sign, CA. Since it's not in Maryland and, even if it were, it would\
      \ be on the east coast (east of California), the answer is NO.\n\nActually,\
      \ let me reason one last time to be completely clear. \n\nThe United States\
      \ can be visualized on a map with the east coast (including states like Maryland\
      \ and Virginia) on the right side and the west coast (including California)\
      \ on the left side.\n\nIf we were to trace a line from the east coast to the\
      \ west coast, we'd be moving from right to left on the map, which is moving\
      \ westward.\n\nIf we were to trace a line from the west coast to the east coast,\
      \ we'd be moving from left to right on the map, which is moving eastward.\n\n\
      Now, the question asks if the George Bush Center for Intelligence, MD is located\
      \ west of the Hollywood Sign, CA. If this were the case, we'd be saying that\
      \ the center in Maryland is to the left (on the map) of the Hollywood Sign in\
      \ California.\n\nBut in reality, Maryland (and nearby Virginia, where the actual\
      \ George Bush Center for Intelligence is located) is on the right side of the\
      \ map (east coast), and California is on the left side of the map (west coast).\
      \ So, the center in Maryland or Virginia would be to the right (on the map)\
      \ of the Hollywood Sign in California, not to the left.\n\nTherefore, the George\
      \ Bush Center for Intelligence, whether it's in Maryland or Virginia, is not\
      \ west of the Hollywood Sign in California. It's east of it.\n\nSo, the answer\
      \ to the question is NO.\n\nI was struggling with the formulation, but let's\
      \ be 100% clear: The geographical fact is that the George Bush Center for Intelligence\
      \ (regardless of whether it's in Maryland as the question states or in Virginia\
      \ as I know it to be) is on the east coast, and the Hollywood Sign is on the\
      \ west coast. Therefore, the center is east of the sign, not west of it.\n\n\
      So, the answer is NO.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nFirst, I need to understand\

    ff5cdefe-b6eb-4db5-a40a-9e8d26a9fd7c: '<think>Let me solve this problem step by
      step.


      The question is: Is George Bush Center for Intelligence, MD located west of
      Hollywood Sign, CA?


      I need to identify the locations of these two places and then determine their
      relative east-west positions.


      1. George Bush Center for Intelligence, MD: This is the headquarters of the
      CIA (Central Intelligence Agency), located in Langley, Virginia (not Maryland
      as the question states, but I''ll continue). It''s on the East Coast of the
      United States.


      Actually, let me double-check. The CIA headquarters is officially called the
      "George Bush Center for Intelligence" named after George H. W. Bush. It''s located
      in Langley, Virginia, which is near Washington D.C. on the East Coast of the
      United States. The "MD" in the question might be referring to Maryland, which
      is adjacent to Virginia, but the CIA headquarters is definitely in Virginia.


      2. Hollywood Sign, CA: This is the famous landmark located in Los Angeles, California,
      on the West Coast of the United States.


      Now, to determine which is west of the other, I need to recall the geography
      of the United States. The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the
      east to the Pacific Ocean on the west.


      - California is on the West Coast, bordering the Pacific Ocean.

      - Virginia (where the CIA headquarters is) is on the East Coast, near the Atlantic
      Ocean.


      In terms of longitude, locations on the West Coast have a higher western longitude
      than locations on the East Coast. This means that California is west of Virginia.


      Therefore, the Hollywood Sign in California is west of the George Bush Center
      for Intelligence in Virginia.


      So, is the George Bush Center for Intelligence west of the Hollywood Sign? No,
      it''s the opposite - the George Bush Center for Intelligence is east of the
      Hollywood Sign.


      The answer is NO.


      Wait, actually let me double check one more time because the question indicates
      the George Bush Center for Intelligence is in MD (Maryland), not VA (Virginia).


      The CIA headquarters, named the George Bush Center for Intelligence, is located
      in Langley, Virginia (VA), not Maryland (MD). However, even if we were talking
      about a facility in Maryland, the answer would still be the same: Maryland is
      on the East Coast, and California is on the West Coast. So a location in Maryland
      would be east of a location in California.


      So the answer is still NO.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine whether George Bush Center for Intelligence, MD is west of Hollywood
      Sign, CA, I need to identify the locations and compare their geographical positions.


      1. **George Bush Center for Intelligence**: This is the CIA headquarters, located
      in Maryland (MD) according to the question, which is on the East Coast of the
      United States.


      2. **Hollywood Sign**: This famous landmark is located in Los Angeles, California
      (CA), which is on the West Coast of the United States.


      3. **Geographic orientation**: In the United States, the East Coast (including
      Maryland) is to the east, and the West Coast (including California) is to the
      west. This means locations in California are generally west of locations in
      Maryland.


      Since the George Bush Center for Intelligence is on the East Coast and the Hollywood
      Sign is on the West Coast, the CIA headquarters cannot be west of the Hollywood
      Sign - it''s actually east of it.
