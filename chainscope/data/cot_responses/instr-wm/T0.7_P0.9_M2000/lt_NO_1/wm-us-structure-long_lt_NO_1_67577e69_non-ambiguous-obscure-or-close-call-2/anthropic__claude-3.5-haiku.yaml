      \u2022 The Hollywood Sign is in Los Angeles, California\n\u2022 Specifically,\
      \ it is located in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles\n\n3. Compare the locations:\n\

      \ in California (West Coast)\n\u2022 These are on opposite sides of the United\
      \ States\n\n4. Specifically address the west/east question:\n\u2022 Virginia\
      \ is east of California\n\u2022 So the CIA headquarters is NOT west of the Hollywood\
      \ Sign\n\n5. Double-check the specific details in the question:\n\u2022 The\
      \ question asks about \"George Bush Center for Intelligence, MD\"\n\u2022 This\
      \ appears to be a slightly incorrect location description\n\u2022 But the fundamental\
      \ geographic relationship remains the same\n\nTherefore, the answer is: NO."
