      1. **Identify the locations**: The United States Capitol is located in Washington,
      D.C. (on the East Coast of the United States), and The Beverly Hills Hotel is
      located in Beverly Hills, California (on the West Coast of the United States).


      2. **Determine the geographical relationship**: Since Washington, D.C. is on
      the East Coast and California is on the West Coast, Washington, D.C. is east
      of California.


      3. **Apply the relationship to the specific locations**: Given that the United

      The Beverly Hills Hotel is located, we can conclude that the United States Capitol
      is not west of The Beverly Hills Hotel.

      2. **Understand the geography**: The East Coast of the United States is generally

      The Beverly Hills Hotel is located) is on the West Coast, we can conclude that
      Washington, D.C. is east of Beverly Hills, CA.


      4. **Answer the question**: The question asks if the United States Capitol,

      Bush Center for Intelligence, MD is located west of the Hollywood Sign, CA,
      let''s break down the locations and their geographical positions.


      1. **George Bush Center for Intelligence, MD**: This is located in Maryland.
      Maryland is on the East Coast of the United States.


      2. **Hollywood Sign, CA**: This is located in California, which is on the West
      Coast of the United States.


      Given these locations:

      - Maryland is east of California.

      - The question asks if the George Bush Center for Intelligence in Maryland is
      west of the Hollywood Sign in California.


      Since Maryland (where the George Bush Center for Intelligence is located) is
      east of California (where the Hollywood Sign is located), the George Bush Center
      for Intelligence is not west of the Hollywood Sign; it is actually east.
