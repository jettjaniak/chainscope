      \ Coast of the United States.\n\n2. **Understand the general geography:**\n\
      \   - The United States is broadly divided into East Coast, Central, and West\
      \ Coast regions. Washington, DC, is in the eastern part of the country, while\
      \ California is in the western part.\n\n3. **Compare longitudinal positions:**\n\
      \   - Washington, DC, is located at approximately 77\xB0 W longitude.\n   -\
      \ Beverly Hills, CA, is located at approximately 118\xB0 W longitude.\n   -\
      \ A lower longitude value (e.g., 77\xB0 W) is farther east than a higher longitude\
      \ value (e.g., 118\xB0 W).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 77\xB0 W (Washington,\
      \ DC) is east of 118\xB0 W (Beverly Hills, CA), the United States Capitol is\
      \ **not west** of The Beverly Hills Hotel.\n\n**Answer: NO**"

      let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Locate Fenway Park, MA**: Fenway Park is a baseball stadium in Boston,
      Massachusetts, which is in the northeastern United States.


      2. **Locate Mount Carmel Center, TX**: Mount Carmel Center is a religious community
      located near Waco, Texas, in the southern central part of the United States.


      3. **Compare their relative positions**: Boston, MA, is located northeast of
      Waco, TX. On a map, this means Fenway Park is east of Mount Carmel Center, not
      west.


      4. **Conclusion**: Fenway Park, MA, is not located west of Mount Carmel Center,
      TX.
