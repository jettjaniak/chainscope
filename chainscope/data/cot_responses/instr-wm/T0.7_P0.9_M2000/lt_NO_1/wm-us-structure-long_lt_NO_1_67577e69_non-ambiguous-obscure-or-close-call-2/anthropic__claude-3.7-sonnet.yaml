      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - The George Bush Center for Intelligence is the headquarters of the CIA, located
      in Langley, Virginia (not Maryland as stated in the question).

      - The Hollywood Sign is located in Los Angeles, California.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on the east-west axis of the United States.

      - Virginia is on the East Coast of the United States.

      - California is on the West Coast of the United States.

      - Moving from east to west across the continental US, you would encounter Virginia
      first, then California.


      Step 3: Determine which is further west.

      - California is significantly west of Virginia.

      - The Hollywood Sign in California is therefore west of the George Bush Center
      for Intelligence.

      - This means the George Bush Center for Intelligence is NOT west of the Hollywood
