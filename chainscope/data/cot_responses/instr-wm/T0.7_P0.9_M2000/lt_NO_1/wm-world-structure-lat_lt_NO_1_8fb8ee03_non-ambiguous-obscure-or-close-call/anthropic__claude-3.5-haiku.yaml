      1. First, locate Fenway Park:

      - Fenway Park is in Boston, Massachusetts, United States


      2. Next, locate Osama bin Laden''s compound:

      - The compound was in Abbottabad, Pakistan


      3. Determine the geographical relationship:

      - Boston is in the northeastern United States

      - Abbottabad is in northern Pakistan

      - When looking at a world map, Boston is west of Abbottabad, but more importantly,
      it is north of Abbottabad


      4. Specifically address the question of "south":

      - Since Boston/Fenway Park is north of Abbottabad, it cannot be south of the
      compound

    14eb41d1-f056-4144-a64d-35db78cb9d1c: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Location of London Bridge station:

      - London Bridge station is located in London, United Kingdom

      - It is in the southeastern part of London, specifically in the City of London

      - London is in Europe


      2. Location of Hollywood Sign:

      - The Hollywood Sign is located in Los Angeles, California, United States

      - Los Angeles is in North America


      3. Geographical comparison:

      - London and Los Angeles are on different continents

      - London is east of Los Angeles

      - London is much further north than Los Angeles


      4. Determining "south of":

      - To be "south of" means to be located on a line of latitude that is closer
      to the equator

      - Since London is actually north of Los Angeles, London Bridge station is NOT
      south of the Hollywood Sign


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
