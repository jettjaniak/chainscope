    edf89ed4-184e-42fd-b28b-f705852a00fd: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s look up the population density of San Francisco:

      - San Francisco has an area of about 46.9 square miles

      - Its population is around 815,000

      - This gives a population density of approximately 17,400 people per square
      mile


      2. Next, let''s look up the population density of San Antonio:

      - San Antonio has an area of about 505 square miles

      - Its population is around 1.5 million

      - This gives a population density of approximately 3,000 people per square mile


      3. Comparing the two:

      - San Francisco: 17,400 people per square mile

      - San Antonio: 3,000 people per square mile


      4. Conclusion:

      San Francisco is MUCH more densely populated than San Antonio.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, San Francisco is NOT less densely populated than
      San Antonio.'
