    e7d9a297-64ac-424e-bf03-65b0a600d2f4: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s understand what zip codes represent:

      - Zip codes are geographic postal codes in the United States

      - The first digit often (but not always) indicates a broad geographic region


      2. Let''s look at the regions of these two zip codes:

      - 10011 is in New York (NY), which is on the East Coast

      - 90069 is in California (CA), which is on the West Coast


      3. Geographic positioning:

      - New York is located in the northeastern part of the United States

      - California is located in the western part of the United States


      4. Relative positioning:

      - When looking at a map of the United States, New York is north of California

      - This means that a zip code in New York (10011) is NOT south of a zip code
      in California (90069)


      5. Therefore, the answer is:


      NO'
