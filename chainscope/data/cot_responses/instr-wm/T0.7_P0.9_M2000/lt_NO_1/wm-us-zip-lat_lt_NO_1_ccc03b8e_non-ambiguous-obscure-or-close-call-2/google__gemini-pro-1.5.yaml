      Coast states when considering the contiguous United States.  However, the curvature
      of the Earth means parts of California extend further north than parts of New

      2. **General US Geography:** New York is on the East Coast, and California is
      on the West Coast.

      3. **North/South Relationship:**  Generally, the West Coast is *west* of the
      East Coast, not directly north or south. Latitude would be the determining factor
      for a north/south relationship.

      4. **Latitude Comparison (needed for accurate answer):**  While a general understanding
      of geography is helpful, zip codes can vary significantly in latitude within
      a state.  It''s necessary to look up the latitude of both zip codes to be certain.  However,
      given the significant East/West distance, it''s *highly likely* one isn''t directly
      south of the other.


      Since the question is specifically about North/South and not general location,
      and requires a yes/no answer without external resources: I cannot definitively
      answer YES or NO without looking up the latitudes. The general East/West positioning
      makes a direct North/South relationship unlikely, but not impossible.
