      - 33139 is a zip code in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States.

      - New York is a northern state, located in the Northeast.

      Step 3: Consider latitude (north-south position).

      - All locations in New York state are north of most of Florida.

      - Florida extends much further south than any part of New York.

      - Florida is in the southeastern part of the United States

      - Florida extends much further south than New York


      Step 3: More specifically, Florida is positioned south of New York on the map
      of the United States. All locations in New York are north of the southernmost
      parts of Florida.


      Step 4: Miami Beach has zip code 33139, which is in the southern part of Florida.


      Step 5: Zip code 11954 corresponds to Mattituck, NY, which is on Long Island
      in New York.


      Step 6: Since any location in New York (including 11954) is north of southern
      Florida locations (including 33139), 11954 is not south of 33139.


      NO'

      Step 1: Let me identify what locations these zip codes correspond to.

      - 11954 is in New York (NY)

      - 33139 is in Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Let me determine the approximate locations.

      - 11954 appears to be in Long Island, New York, which is in the northeastern
      United States

      - 33139 appears to be in Miami Beach, Florida, which is in the southeastern
      United States


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes (north-south positions).

      - New York locations, including Long Island, are generally located much further
      north in the United States

      - Florida, especially Miami Beach, is one of the southernmost points in the
      continental United States


      Step 4: Make the geographical comparison.

      - New York (including zip code 11954) is north of Florida

      - Florida (including zip code 33139) is south of New York


      Therefore, 11954, NY is NOT located south of 33139, FL. It''s actually located
      north of it.
