      their geographical coordinates, specifically latitude.


      **Step 1: Understand what the zip codes represent.**

      - Zip Code 10007 is in New York City, specifically in Lower Manhattan.

      - Zip Code 90028 is in Los Angeles, California, specifically the Hollywood area.


      **Step 2: Determine the latitude (north-south position) of each zip code.**

      - New York City (Lower Manhattan, 10007) is approximately at latitude 40.713
