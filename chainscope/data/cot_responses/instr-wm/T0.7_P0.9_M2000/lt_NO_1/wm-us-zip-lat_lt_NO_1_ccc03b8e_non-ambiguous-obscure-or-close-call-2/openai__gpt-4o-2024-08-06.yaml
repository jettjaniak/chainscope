      \ the locations:**\n   - 10001 is a ZIP code for New York, NY.\n   - 90265 is\
      \ a ZIP code for Malibu, CA.\n\n2. **Understand geographic orientation:**\n\
      \   - Latitude lines run horizontally around the globe. The equator is at 0\
      \ degrees latitude, and the further north you go, the higher the latitude number\
      \ (up to 90 degrees at the North Pole). Conversely, the further south you go,\
      \ the lower the latitude number (down to -90 degrees at the South Pole).\n\n\
      3. **Determine the general latitudinal positions:**\n   - New York, NY, is located\
      \ at a latitude of approximately 40.7 degrees North.\n   - Malibu, CA, is located\
      \ at a latitude of approximately 34.0 degrees North.\n\n4. **Compare the latitudes:**\n\
      \   - Since 40.7 (New York) is a higher number than 34.0 (Malibu), New York\
      \ is north of Malibu.\n\nTherefore, 10001, NY is not located south of 90265,\
      \ CA.\n\n**Answer: NO**"

      \ NY is located south of 90265, CA, we need to consider their geographical locations:\n\
      \n1. **Identify the locations:**\n   - Zip code 10001 is in New York, specifically\
      \ in the neighborhood of Chelsea in Manhattan.\n   - Zip code 90265 is in California,\
      \ specifically in Malibu.\n\n2. **Determine the latitude of each location:**\n\
      \   - New York City (including zip code 10001) is located at a latitude of approximately\
      \ 40.71\xB0 N.\n   - Malibu (including zip code 90265) is located at a latitude\
      \ of approximately 34.03\xB0 N.\n\n3. **Compare the latitudes:**\n   - Since\
      \ 40.71\xB0 N (New York) is greater than 34.03\xB0 N (Malibu), New York is located\
      \ further north than Malibu.\n\nTherefore, zip code 10001, NY is not located\
      \ south of 90265, CA.\n\n**Final Answer: NO**"
