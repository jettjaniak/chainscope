    4f5da2a5-0bcf-4202-9cfc-0939d79f4297: 'To answer this question,
      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the length of The Grudge**: The Grudge, released in 2004, has
      a runtime. According to various sources, the original theatrical version of
      The Grudge runs approximately 91 minutes (or about 1 hour and 31 minutes).


      2. **Identify the length of Aashiqui**: Aashiqui, released in 1990, also has
      a specified runtime. According to various sources, the theatrical version of
      Aashiqui runs approximately 152 minutes (or about 2 hours and 32 minutes).


      3. **Compare the lengths of the two movies**: Now, we compare the runtime of
      The Grudge (approximately 91 minutes) with the runtime of Aashiqui (approximately
      152 minutes).


      Given these steps, we can conclude that The Grudge is shorter than Aashiqui.
      Therefore, the answer to whether The Grudge is shorter than Aashiqui is:


      YES'
