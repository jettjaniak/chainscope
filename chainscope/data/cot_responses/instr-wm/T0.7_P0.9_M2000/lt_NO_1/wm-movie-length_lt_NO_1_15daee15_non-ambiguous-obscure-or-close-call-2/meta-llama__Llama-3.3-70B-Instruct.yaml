      1. **Identify the Running Time of Takashi Shimizu''s The Grudge**: The Grudge,
      also known as Ju-On: The Grudge in some markets, is a 2004 supernatural horror
      film directed by Takashi Shimizu. According to various sources, including IMDb,
      the original Japanese version of Ju-On: The Grudge (2002) has a runtime of approximately
      92 minutes. However, the American remake or the version most commonly referred
      to in Western contexts, released in 2004, has a runtime of about 91 minutes.


      2. **Identify the Running Time of Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui**: Aashiqui is a
      1990 Indian musical romance film directed by Mahesh Bhatt. According to IMDb
      and other sources, Aashiqui has a runtime of approximately 152 minutes (or 2
      hours and 32 minutes).


      3. **Comparison**: Now, comparing the lengths of the two movies - The Grudge
      (approximately 91 minutes for the version most commonly referenced in a Western
      context) and Aashiqui (approximately 152 minutes) - it''s clear that The Grudge
      is significantly shorter than Aashiqui.

      \ we need to compare the lengths of two movies: Peter Jackson's \"The Hobbit\"\

      \ identify the specific movie in question for \"The Hobbit\". Peter Jackson\
      \ directed a trilogy based on \"The Hobbit\", which includes \"An Unexpected\
      \ Journey\", \"The Desolation of Smaug\", and \"The Battle of the Five Armies\"\
      . Without specifying which part of \"The Hobbit\" trilogy we are referring to,\
      \ it's challenging to give a precise answer. However, for the sake of comparison,\
      \ let's consider the first part, \"An Unexpected Journey\", as it's the most\
      \ direct comparison to a single installment like \"Harry Potter and the Deathly\
      \ Hallows\".\n\nThe runtime of \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\" (2012)\
      \ is approximately 169 minutes (2 hours and 49 minutes).\n\nNext, \"Harry Potter\
      \ and the Deathly Hallows\" was also split into two parts by David Yates: \"\
      Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1\" and \"Harry Potter and\
      \ the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2\". Since the question doesn't specify which\
      \ part, for a fair comparison, we should consider both parts. However, traditionally,\
      \ when comparing the length of movies, especially in a series where a story\
      \ is split into parts, we might consider the combined runtime of both parts\
      \ for a complete story or compare each part individually.\n\nThe runtime of\
      \ \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1\" (2010) is approximately\
      \ 146 minutes (2 hours and 26 minutes), and \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\

      \ whether it is shorter than \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" (considering\
      \ either part) is NO."

      \ \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\" (2012), \"The Hobbit: The Desolation\

      \ (2011).\n\n2. **Determine the total runtime for each series**:\n   - For \"\
      The Hobbit\" trilogy:\n     - \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\" (2012) has\
      \ a runtime of approximately 169 minutes (2 hours 49 minutes).\n     - \"The\

      \ Armies\" (2014) has a runtime of approximately 144 minutes (2 hours 24 minutes).\n\
      \     - Total runtime for \"The Hobbit\" trilogy = 169 + 161 + 144 = 474 minutes\
      \ (7 hours 54 minutes).\n   - For \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\":\n\
      \     - \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1\" (2010) has a\
      \ runtime of approximately 146 minutes (2 hours 26 minutes).\n     - \"Harry\
      \ Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2\" (2011) has a runtime of approximately\
      \ 130 minutes (2 hours 10 minutes).\n     - Total runtime for \"Harry Potter\
      \ and the Deathly Hallows\" = 146 + 130 = 276 minutes (4 hours 36 minutes).\n\
      \n3. **Compare the total runtimes**:\n   - The total runtime of \"The Hobbit\"\
      \ trilogy is 474 minutes.\n   - The total runtime of \"Harry Potter and the\

      \ Hallows\" except possibly when comparing the shortest \"Hobbit\" film to the\
      \ shortest \"Deathly Hallows\" film. But considering the total runtime for each\
      \ series as a whole, \"The Hobbit\" trilogy is longer.\n\nGiven the original\
      \ phrasing of the question, which does not specify the parts but refers to \"\
      The Hobbit\" and \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" as singular entities,\

      2. **Identify the movies in Adam McKay''s Anchorman series**: The Anchorman
      series includes Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004), Anchorman 2: The
      Legend Continues (2013), and an upcoming third installment has been talked about
      but not officially released or confirmed with Adam McKay''s direction as of
      my last update. For the purpose of this comparison, we consider the two released
      movies.


      3. **Compare the lengths of the two series**: Both series, as per the information
      considered, have two main movies each when strictly considering the directors
      in question for a fair comparison.


      Given the above analysis, the answer to whether Priyadarshan''s Hera Pheri series
      is shorter than Adam McKay''s Anchorman series would be **NO**, as both have
      essentially two movies when considering the specific directors mentioned.'

      \ of Andrew Adamson's The Chronicles of Narnia. The Chronicles of Narnia: The\
      \ Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, directed by Andrew Adamson, has a runtime\
      \ of approximately 145 minutes (2 hours 25 minutes).\n\n2. Next, let's find\
