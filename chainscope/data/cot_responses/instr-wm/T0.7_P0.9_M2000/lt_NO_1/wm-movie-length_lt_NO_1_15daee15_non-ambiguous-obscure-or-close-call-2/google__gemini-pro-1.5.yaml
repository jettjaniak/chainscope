      Without knowing the exact runtimes, I can''t give a definitive YES or NO. However,

      sequels are often shorter than the originals, and three films tend to have a

      as definitive.

      (2004) and Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013).


      3. **Comparing lengths:** We need to compare the total runtime of two Hera Pheri
      films to the total runtime of two Anchorman films.  I don''t have the exact
      runtimes without looking them up.  However, generally speaking, Bollywood films
      tend to be longer than Hollywood comedies.


      4. **Likely outcome:**  Even if one Hera Pheri film is shorter than one Anchorman
      film, the combined runtime of two Hera Pheri movies is *likely* longer than
      the combined runtime of two Anchorman movies.


      5. **Answer:**  Likely NO.  (But confirming requires looking up the exact runtimes.)

      sometimes Hera Pheri 3 (2024) is included, though its connection is debated.

      Ron Burgundy (2004) and Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013).

      3. **Determine the criterion for "shorter":**  This likely refers to the number
      of films in the series.


      4. **Compare the number of films:** Hera Pheri has 2 or 3 films, depending on
      inclusion of the third. Anchorman has 2 films.


      5. **Answer:**  If Hera Pheri 3 is included, the answer is NO. If only the first
      two Hera Pheri films are considered, the answer is YES. Since the question doesn''t

      Chronicles of Narnia:** This refers to a series of films.  To compare lengths,
      we need to specify which film. Let''s assume this refers to the first film,
      "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" (2005), as it''s the most well-known.


      2. **Shakti Samanta''s Aradhana (1969):** This is a single film.


      3. **Finding Runtimes:** We need the runtimes of both films.  "The Lion, the
      Witch, and the Wardrobe" is approximately 143 minutes. Aradhana has a runtime
      of approximately 170 minutes.
