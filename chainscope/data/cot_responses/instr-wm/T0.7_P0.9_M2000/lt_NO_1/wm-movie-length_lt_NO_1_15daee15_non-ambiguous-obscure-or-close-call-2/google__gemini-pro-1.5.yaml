      for a YES/NO answer, but a general idea is helpful.  *The Hobbit* movies are

      2. **Anchorman series:** This consists of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy
      (2004) and Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013).


      3. **Comparing lengths:** We need to compare the total runtime of two Hera Pheri
      films to the total runtime of two Anchorman films.  I don''t have the exact
      runtimes without looking them up.  However, generally speaking, Bollywood films
      tend to be longer than Hollywood comedies.


      4. **Likely outcome:**  Even if one Hera Pheri film is shorter than one Anchorman
      film, the combined runtime of two Hera Pheri movies is *likely* longer than
      the combined runtime of two Anchorman movies.


      5. **Answer:**  Likely NO.  (But confirming requires looking up the exact runtimes.)

      3 (2024) is included, though its connection is debated.

      3. **Determine the criterion for "shorter":**  This likely refers to the number
      of films in the series.


      4. **Compare the number of films:** Hera Pheri has 2 or 3 films, depending on
      inclusion of the third. Anchorman has 2 films.


      5. **Answer:**  If Hera Pheri 3 is included, the answer is NO. If only the first
      two Hera Pheri films are considered, the answer is YES. Since the question doesn''t
