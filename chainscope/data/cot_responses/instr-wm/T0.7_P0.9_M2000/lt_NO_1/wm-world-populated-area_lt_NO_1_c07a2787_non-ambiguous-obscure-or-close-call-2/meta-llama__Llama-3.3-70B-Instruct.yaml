      context, it''s reasonable to assume the question refers to the "Nile" as in

      of Naples) is less than 20,877.6 square kilometers (the area of Clark County,
      Nevada), Clark County, Nevada, has a larger area than the Province of Naples.


      So, the question asks if Clark County, Nevada, has a smaller area than the Province
      of Naples. Based on our calculations, the answer is **NO**.'

      let''s break it down into steps to compare the areas of Greater Orlando and
      Mecca.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Greater Orlando refers to the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford,
      FL Metropolitan Statistical Area in the United States. Mecca is a city in Saudi
      Arabia, known for being the holiest city in Islam.


      2. **Determine the area of Greater Orlando**: The area of the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford,
      FL Metropolitan Statistical Area (which is what Greater Orlando refers to) covers
      approximately 2,890 square miles (7,485 square kilometers).


      3. **Determine the area of Mecca**: Mecca, as a city, has a smaller area. The
      city of Mecca itself covers about 76 square miles (197 square kilometers), but
      the Mecca Province (which includes the city and its surroundings) covers an
      area of approximately 151,481 square kilometers (58,487 square miles). However,
      when comparing the city or metropolitan area directly, the relevant comparison
      is usually with the city proper or the metropolitan area of Mecca, not the entire
      province. The metropolitan area of Mecca (which would be a closer comparison
      to Greater Orlando) is not as commonly defined in terms of area as Western metropolitan
      areas, but considering the city itself gives us a basis for comparison.


      4. **Compare the areas**: The area of Greater Orlando (approximately 7,485 square
      kilometers) is significantly larger than the area of the city of Mecca (about
      197 square kilometers). Even if considering the broader Mecca Province for comparison
      (which would not be a direct comparison but gives context), the question seems
      to be asking about the city or metropolitan area level.


      Based on this analysis, the answer to whether Greater Orlando has a smaller
      area than Mecca is **NO**, because Greater Orlando has a larger area than the
      city of Mecca.'

      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the areas in question**: We are comparing the area of Pyongyang,
      which is the capital city of North Korea, with the Upper West Side, which is
      a neighborhood in Manhattan, New York City.


      2. **Find the area of Pyongyang**: According to various sources, Pyongyang covers
      an area of approximately 3,230 square kilometers (1,247 square miles).


      3. **Find the area of the Upper West Side**: The Upper West Side is a neighborhood
      in Manhattan, New York City. The boundaries of the Upper West Side are generally
      considered to be 59th Street to 125th Street, and from the Hudson River to Central
      Park. The area of the Upper West Side can be approximated by considering the
      area of Manhattan and then calculating the fraction that the Upper West Side
      occupies. Manhattan''s total area is about 59.5 square kilometers (22.96 square
      miles). The Upper West Side, being a part of Manhattan, occupies a fraction
      of this area. For simplicity, if we consider the Upper West Side to roughly
      span about half of Manhattan''s width (which is a rough estimate, as it actually
      spans more than half in terms of north-south length but not in terms of east-west
      width) and about half of its length (from 59th to 125th out of the total length
      from the southern tip to 155th street in Harlem at the north, though the actual
      northern boundary of the Upper West Side is somewhat below 125th street), we
      are still looking at a significant portion but not the entirety. An exact figure
      requires precise boundaries, but we can estimate it as significantly less than
      half of Manhattan''s total area due to the irregular boundaries and the fact
      that it doesn''t span the full width of Manhattan. A rough estimate might place
      it around 10-15 square kilometers (3.86 to 5.79 square miles), but this is a
      very rough approximation.


      4. **Compare the areas**: Given the approximations, Pyongyang covers approximately
      3,230 square kilometers, while the Upper West Side covers roughly around 10-15
      square kilometers (using the rough estimate). This means Pyongyang is significantly
      larger than the Upper West Side.


      Based on this analysis, the answer to whether Pyongyang has a smaller area than

      we need to compare the areas of London and Lisbon.


      Step 1: Find the area of London. The area of London is approximately 607 square
      miles (1,572 square kilometers).


      Step 2: Find the area of Lisbon. The area of Lisbon is approximately 100.05

      the metropolitan area, it''s about 2,921.90 square kilometers (1,128.17 square
      miles). However, for a direct comparison with London, we should consider the
      urban or city area, which is what''s directly comparable to the given London
      area.


      Step 3: Convert the areas to the same unit for an accurate comparison. Since
      London''s area is given in both square miles and square kilometers, we can use
      either. Let''s use square kilometers for consistency: London is approximately
      1,572 square kilometers.


      Step 4: Compare the areas. Lisbon''s city area is about 100.05 square kilometers,
      which is significantly smaller than London''s 1,572 square kilometers.


      Based on these steps, London has a larger area than Lisbon, so the answer to

      in the eastern Mediterranean. According to various sources, the area of Crete
      is approximately 8,336 square kilometers (3,219 square miles).


      2. **Identify the area of Manhattan**: Manhattan is one of the five boroughs
      of New York City, USA. It is well-known for being a major commercial, financial,
      and cultural center. The area of Manhattan is about 59.5 square kilometers (22.96
      square miles).


      3. **Compare the areas**: Now, we compare the area of Crete (approximately 8,336
      square kilometers) with the area of Manhattan (approximately 59.5 square kilometers).


      Given that 8,336 square kilometers is significantly larger than 59.5 square
      kilometers, we can conclude that Crete has a much larger area than Manhattan.


      Therefore, the answer to the question of whether Crete has a smaller area than
      Manhattan is: **NO**.'

      part of New York State, USA. It consists of four counties: Kings (Brooklyn),
      Queens, Nassau, and Suffolk.

      It is most famous for the Giza Plateau, which includes the Pyramids of Giza,
      but when referring to area, we consider the Giza Governorate or the city itself,
      depending on the context. For simplicity, let''s focus on the Giza Governorate.


      3. **Find the area of Long Island**: The total area of Long Island (including
      the water area of bays, etc.) is approximately 3,629 square miles (9,395 square
      kilometers).


      4. **Find the area of Giza Governorate**: The Giza Governorate in Egypt covers

      1. **Identify Long Island and Giza**: Long Island is a large island located
      in the southeastern part of New York State in the United States. Giza, on the
      other hand, is a city on the Nile River in Egypt, most famous for the Giza Necropolis,
      which includes the Pyramids of Giza.


      2. **Determine the Area of Long Island**: Long Island, New York, covers an area
      of approximately 1,401 square miles (3,629 square kilometers).


      3. **Determine the Area of Giza**: The Giza Governorate in Egypt has an area
      of about 13,272 square kilometers (5,125 square miles). However, the city of
      Giza itself, or more specifically the area usually referred to as Giza (around
      the pyramids and the urban area), is much smaller, but exact boundaries can
      be ambiguous. For the purpose of comparison, if we consider the Giza Governorate
      for a broader understanding, it''s clear that the governorate is larger than
      Long Island. However, if focusing strictly on the city or the immediate area
      around the pyramids, the area would be significantly smaller.

      referring to the city or immediate area of Giza, which would be much smaller
      than Long Island.


      Given the ambiguity in the question regarding what "Giza" refers to (the city,
      the governorate, or the specific area around the pyramids), the most straightforward
      interpretation based on commonly available data would be comparing Long Island
      to the Giza Governorate. Under this interpretation, Long Island indeed has a
      smaller area than the Giza Governorate.

      2. **Identify Punta Cana**: Punta Cana is a popular tourist destination located
      at the easternmost tip of the Dominican Republic, in the Caribbean. It''s not
      an administrative division but a geographical area known for its beaches and
      resorts. The exact area of Punta Cana can be somewhat ambiguous since it refers
      more to a region than a strictly defined administrative area. However, considering
      the broader area that includes all the resorts and the geographical expanse
      commonly associated with Punta Cana, it is significantly smaller than the Community
      of Madrid. The Punta Cana region itself might cover around 420 square kilometers,
