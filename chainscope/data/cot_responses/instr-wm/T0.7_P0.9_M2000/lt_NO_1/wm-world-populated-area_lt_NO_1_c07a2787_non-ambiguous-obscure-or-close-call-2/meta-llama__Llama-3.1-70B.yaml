      Area is a planning area in Singapore.


      2. **Find the area of Tokyo**: Tokyo is one of the largest metropolitan areas
      in the world. As of my last update, the Greater Tokyo Area covers approximately
      13,572 square kilometers (5,240 square miles).


      3. **Find the area of Central Area, Singapore**: Central Area is a planning
      area in Singapore''s Central Region. According to the Urban Redevelopment Authority
      (URA), the Central Area covers an area of approximately 17.84 square kilometers
      (6.89 square miles).


      4. **Compare the areas**: Now, we can compare the areas of Tokyo (13,572 square
      kilometers) and Central Area, Singapore (17.84 square kilometers).


      5. **Conclusion**: Since 13,572 square kilometers (Tokyo) is significantly larger
      than 17.84 square kilometers (Central Area, Singapore), we can conclude that
      Tokyo does not have a smaller area than Central Area, Singapore.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Tokyo has a smaller area than Central Area,
      Singapore is: $\boxed{NO}$

      1,045 square kilometers (404 square miles).


      3. **Amsterdam-Centrum''s area**: Amsterdam-Centrum, or Amsterdam city center,
      is a part of the city of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. The exact area of Amsterdam-Centrum
      can vary depending on the specific boundaries considered, but it''s generally
      smaller than the entire city of Amsterdam. The area of the city of Amsterdam
      is about 219 square kilometers (85 square miles), but the central area is likely
      smaller.

      229,848 square kilometers (88,745 square miles).


      2. **Find the area of Tenerife**: Tenerife is the largest of the Canary Islands,
      located off the west coast of Africa. The area of Tenerife is approximately
      2,034 square kilometers (785 square miles).


      3. **Compare the areas**: Now, we compare the areas. Great Britain has an area
      of approximately 229,848 square kilometers, while Tenerife has an area of approximately
      2,034 square kilometers.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since 229,848 square kilometers (Great Britain) is significantly
      larger than 2,034 square kilometers (Tenerife), we can conclude that Great Britain
      does not have a smaller area than Tenerife.
