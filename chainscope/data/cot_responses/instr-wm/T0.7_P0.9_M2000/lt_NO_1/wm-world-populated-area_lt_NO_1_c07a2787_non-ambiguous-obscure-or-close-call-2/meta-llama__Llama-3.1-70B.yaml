      of both places. Here''s a step-by-step breakdown:


      1. **Identify the areas**: Tokyo is a metropolitan area in Japan, while Central
      Area is a planning area in Singapore.


      2. **Find the area of Tokyo**: Tokyo is one of the largest metropolitan areas
      in the world. As of my last update, the Greater Tokyo Area covers approximately
      13,572 square kilometers (5,240 square miles).


      3. **Find the area of Central Area, Singapore**: Central Area is a planning
      area in Singapore''s Central Region. According to the Urban Redevelopment Authority
      (URA), the Central Area covers an area of approximately 17.84 square kilometers
      (6.89 square miles).


      4. **Compare the areas**: Now, we can compare the areas of Tokyo (13,572 square
      kilometers) and Central Area, Singapore (17.84 square kilometers).


      5. **Conclusion**: Since 13,572 square kilometers (Tokyo) is significantly larger
      than 17.84 square kilometers (Central Area, Singapore), we can conclude that
      Tokyo does not have a smaller area than Central Area, Singapore.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Tokyo has a smaller area than Central Area,
      Singapore is: $\boxed{NO}$

      1,045 square kilometers (404 square miles).


      3. **Amsterdam-Centrum''s area**: Amsterdam-Centrum, or Amsterdam city center,
      is a part of the city of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. The exact area of Amsterdam-Centrum
      can vary depending on the specific boundaries considered, but it''s generally
      smaller than the entire city of Amsterdam. The area of the city of Amsterdam
      is about 219 square kilometers (85 square miles), but the central area is likely
      smaller.


      4. **Comparison**: Now, we compare the areas. Tahiti has an area of approximately
      1,045 square kilometers, while Amsterdam-Centrum is likely smaller than the
      entire city of Amsterdam, which has an area of about 219 square kilometers.

      Long Island is a large island located in the southeastern part of the state
      of New York, USA. Giza is a city and a governorate in Egypt, known for its ancient
      pyramids and the Great Sphinx.


      2. **Find the area of Long Island**: Long Island covers an area of approximately
      3,629 square miles (9,394 square kilometers).


      3. **Find the area of Giza**: Giza has an area of approximately 4,645 square
      kilometers (1,793 square miles).


      4. **Compare the areas**: Now, we compare the areas of Long Island (3,629 square
      miles) and Giza (1,793 square miles).


      Based on these steps, since 3,629 square miles (Long Island) is larger than
