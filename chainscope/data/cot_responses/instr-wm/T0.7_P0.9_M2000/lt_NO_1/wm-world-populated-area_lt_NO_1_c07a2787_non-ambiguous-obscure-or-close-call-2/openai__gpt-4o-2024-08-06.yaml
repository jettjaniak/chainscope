      The River Nile is a river, not a state. It flows through several countries in
      northeastern Africa. There is no political state or region officially named
      "River Nile."

      an area of about 10.4 square kilometers (4 square miles).


      Since "River Nile (state)" does not exist as a defined geographic or political
      entity, it cannot have an area that can be compared to Capri. However, if the
      question intended to refer to a region named after the Nile or a specific administrative
      area along the Nile, more information would be needed to make a comparison.

      Since the Nile is not a state or a defined area in terms of land mass, it does
      not have a measurable area in the way a geographic region or island would.

      a state or region) has a smaller area than Capri, we need to clarify and compare
      the areas of the two entities in question:


      1. **River Nile (State):** The River Nile itself is a river, not a state. It
      runs through several countries in northeastern Africa, including Uganda, Sudan,
      and Egypt. There is no specific "state" known as the River Nile. However, if
      we consider regions or governorates named after the Nile, such as the Nile River
      State in Sudan, we can assess its size. The Nile River State in Sudan is a large
      administrative region with an area of approximately 122,123 square kilometers.


      2. **Capri:** Capri is an island in Italy, located in the Tyrrhenian Sea off
      the Sorrentine Peninsula. The island has a total area of about 10.4 square kilometers.


      By comparing these areas:


      - The Nile River State in Sudan is significantly larger than Capri, with an
      area of 122,123 square kilometers compared to Capri''s 10.4 square kilometers.

      Now, we compare the two areas:


      - Tuscany: 22,985 square kilometers

      - Bangalore: 709 square kilometers


      Since 22,985 square kilometers (Tuscany) is much larger than 709 square kilometers
      (Bangalore), Tuscany has a larger area than Bangalore.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Does Tuscany have a smaller area than
