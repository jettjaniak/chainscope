      1) Normandy is a region in northern France, in Western Europe.

      2) Mainland Australia is a continent in the southern hemisphere.

      3) France (including Normandy) is in the northern hemisphere.

      4) Any place in the northern hemisphere is north of any place in the southern

      5) Since Normandy is in the northern hemisphere and mainland Australia is in

      of it.


      So the answer is NO, Normandy is not located south of mainland Australia. It''s
      actually located north of it.</think>To answer this question, I need to identify
      the locations of both places and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify where Normandy is located.

      Normandy is a region in northern France, located in Western Europe. France is
      in the Northern Hemisphere.


      Step 2: Identify where Mainland Australia is located.

      Mainland Australia is a continent in the Southern Hemisphere.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Since Normandy is in the Northern Hemisphere and Mainland Australia is in the
      Southern Hemisphere, Normandy must be north of Australia, not south of it. The
      equator separates the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and Normandy is above
      the equator while Australia is below it.

      Casablanca is a major city in Morocco, which is in North Africa. Morocco is
      at the northwestern part of Africa.


      Cape Town is a major city in South Africa, which is at the southern tip of Africa.


      Africa extends from north to south, with Morocco near the top (north) and South
      Africa at the bottom (south).


      In terms of latitude:

      - Casablanca is in the northern hemisphere, in North Africa

      - Cape Town is near the southern tip of Africa, in the southern hemisphere

      part of Africa, Casablanca is north of Cape Town, not south of it.</think>To
      answer whether Casablanca is located south of Cape Town, I need to consider
      the geographic locations of both cities.


      Step 1: Identify where Casablanca is located.

      Casablanca is a major city in Morocco, which is in North Africa.


      Step 2: Identify where Cape Town is located.

      Cape Town is a major city in South Africa, which is at the southern tip of the
      African continent.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the north-south axis.

      Morocco is in the northern part of Africa, while South Africa is (as the name
      suggests) in the southern part of Africa. Looking at their latitudes, Casablanca
      is in the northern hemisphere, while Cape Town is near the southern tip of Africa
      in the southern hemisphere.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Casablanca is in North Africa and Cape Town is at the southern end of
      Africa, Casablanca is north of Cape Town, not south of it.

      South Beach is a neighborhood in Miami Beach, Florida, at the southern tip of

      New York City is much further north in the United States compared to Miami,

      1. Verona is a city in Italy, located in Northern Italy in the Veneto region.

      (where the Nile River flows).

      5. The Nile flows roughly from south to north, with its mouth at the Mediterranean

      Step 2: Identify where the River Nile is located.

      The River Nile flows through northeastern Africa, primarily through countries

      First, let me identify where Verona is:

      Verona is a city in northern Italy, located in the Veneto region.


      Now, let''s identify what is meant by "River Nile (state)":

      The River Nile is a major river in Africa, flowing through multiple countries
      including Egypt, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda,
      Burundi, and Democratic Republic of the Congo.


      However, the question mentions "River Nile (state)" which is a bit confusing
      as there isn''t a state named "River Nile" to my knowledge. There is a River
      Nile State in Sudan (sometimes called Nile River State), which is one of the
      states of Sudan through which the Nile River flows.


      Now, let''s determine the relative positions:

      - Verona is in northern Italy, which is in Europe.

      - The Nile River and any state named after it would be in Africa.


      Looking at a global map, Italy is north of Africa. Since Verona is in northern

      I need to determine the geographic positions of both locations to answer this
      question.


      ## Step 1: Locate Verona

      Verona is a city in northern Italy, in the Veneto region of Europe.


      ## Step 2: Identify River Nile (state)

      The River Nile is in northeast Africa, flowing through multiple countries. There
      is a "River Nile State" (or Nile State) in Sudan.


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      - Verona is located in northern Italy (Europe)

      - River Nile State is located in Sudan (Africa)

      - Europe is north of Africa


      Since Verona is in Europe and River Nile State is in Africa, Verona is located
      north of River Nile State, not south of it.

      \ to identify the locations and compare their latitudes.\n\nFirst, let's clarify\
      \ the location \"Casablanca, Havana\" - this is a bit confusing because:\n-\
      \ Casablanca is a city in Morocco, North Africa\n- Havana is the capital of\
      \ Cuba in the Caribbean\n\nThere might be some confusion here, as the question\

      \ If such a place exists, it would be located in Havana, Cuba.\n\nNow let's\
      \ determine the latitudes:\n- Havana, Cuba is located at approximately 23.1\xB0\

      \nSince Havana is at 23.1\xB0 N and Bangalore is at 12.9\xB0 N, Havana is NORTH\

      \ assume the question is asking about either Casablanca or Havana, or possibly\
      \ a neighborhood named Casablanca within Havana.\n\nStep 2: Determine the latitudes.\n\
      - Casablanca, Morocco is at approximately 33.6\xB0 N latitude\n- Havana, Cuba\
      \ is at approximately 23.1\xB0 N latitude\n- If referring to Casablanca in Havana\
