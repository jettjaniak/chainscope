      Miami-Dade County (Florida), and given that south means having a lower latitude,
      Brooklyn cannot be south of Miami-Dade County.

      - Bethlehem is in the West Bank, placing it in the Middle East, but it is generally
      east and slightly south of Italy.

      - Italy (and thus Tuscany) is generally northwest of the West Bank (and thus

      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to understand the geographical locations
      of Verona and the River Nile. Verona is a city in Italy, which is in Europe.
      The River Nile is primarily located in northeastern Africa, flowing through
      several countries including Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia.


      2. **Determine the general geographical direction**: Knowing that Verona is
      in Europe and the River Nile is in Africa helps us understand their relative
      positions. Generally, Europe is north of Africa.


      3. **Consider the specific location of Verona and the River Nile**: Verona,
      Italy, is in the northern part of the Italian peninsula. The River Nile, particularly
      its delta and the majority of its length, lies south of Verona''s latitude.
      The Nile flows northwards through Africa and empties into the Mediterranean

      \   - Since latitude measures how far north or south a place is from the equator,\
      \ a lower latitude number indicates a location is closer to the equator or south\
