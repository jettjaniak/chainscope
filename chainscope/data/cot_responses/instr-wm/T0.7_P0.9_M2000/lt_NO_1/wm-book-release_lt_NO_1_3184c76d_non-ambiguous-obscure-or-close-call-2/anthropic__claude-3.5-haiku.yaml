      - This book was published in 2006


      2. Next, let''s find the publication date for Nancy Drew and the Secret of the
      Old Clock

      - This book was published in 1930


      3. Now, we can compare the two dates

      - 2006 is later than 1930

      - This means Mistborn: The Final Empire was released AFTER Nancy Drew and the
      Secret of the Old Clock


      4. The question asks: "Was Brandon Sanderson''s Mistborn: The Final Empire released
      earlier than Carolyn Keene''s Nancy Drew and the Secret of the Old Clock?"

      - Since Mistborn was released in 2006, which is later than 1930, the answer
      is NO.
