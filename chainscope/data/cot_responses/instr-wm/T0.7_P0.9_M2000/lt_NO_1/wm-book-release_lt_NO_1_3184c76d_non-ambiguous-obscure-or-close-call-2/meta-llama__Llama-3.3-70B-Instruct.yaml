      we need to determine the release dates of the two books: Martin Handford''s
      "Where''s Wally? The Wonder Book" and Judi Barrett''s "Cloudy with a Chance
      of Meatballs".


      1. First, let''s look at Judi Barrett''s "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs".
      It was written by Judi Barrett and illustrated by Ron Barrett. The book was
      published in 1978.


      2. Next, we consider Martin Handford''s series. The first "Where''s Wally?"
      book, also known as "Where''s Waldo?" in North America, was published in 1987.
      "Where''s Wally? The Wonder Book" is part of this series but was published later
      than the first book. However, since the first book in the series was published
      in 1987, any book in the series, including "The Wonder Book", would be after
      1978.


      Given the information:

      - "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" was published in 1978.

      - The first "Where''s Wally?" book was published in 1987, which means "The Wonder
      Book" would also be published after 1978.


      Therefore, "Where''s Wally? The Wonder Book" was not released earlier than "Cloudy
      with a Chance of Meatballs".


      The answer is: NO'

      1. **Identify the publication date of N. K. Jemisin''s "The Fifth Season":**
      The first book in the Broken Earth trilogy, "The Fifth Season," was published
      in 2015.


      2. **Identify the publication date of Martin Handford''s "Where''s Wally? The
      Fantastic Journey":** The original "Where''s Wally?" book was published in 1987.
      However, the series has seen numerous releases and titles over the years. Without
      a specific date for "The Fantastic Journey," we''ll consider the overall timeline
      of the series. Given that the first book was in 1987, any book in the series,
      including "The Fantastic Journey," would likely have been published after this
      date but potentially well before 2015, considering the popularity and longevity
      of the series.


      3. **Compare the publication dates:** Given that "The Fifth Season" was published
      in 2015 and the "Where''s Wally?" series started in 1987, it''s clear that the
      first "Where''s Wally?" book was published before "The Fifth Season." Without
      the exact date for "The Fantastic Journey," we have to assume it could have
      been published at any point after 1987. However, considering the context of
      the question, if "The Fantastic Journey" is part of the "Where''s Wally?" series,
      it would still be part of a series that began significantly earlier than the
      publication of "The Fifth Season."


      Given these steps, the answer to whether N. K. Jemisin''s "The Fifth Season"
      was released earlier than Martin Handford''s "Where''s Wally? The Fantastic
      Journey" is **NO**, because "The Fifth Season" was published in 2015, and even
      if we don''t have the exact date for "The Fantastic Journey," the "Where''s

      The series started in the late 1980s. The first book, "Where''s Wally?" (or

      we need to determine the release dates of the two books mentioned:


      1. Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman''s American Gods

      2. Ian Fleming''s From Russia, with Love


      Step 1: Identify the authors and their books - Done. The authors are Neil Gaiman
      and Ian Fleming, and the books are American Gods and From Russia, with Love,
      respectively.


      Step 2: Determine the release date of American Gods. Neil Gaiman''s American

      let''s break down the steps:


      1. Identify the publication year of Michael Crichton''s Jurassic Park.

      2. Identify the publication year of Roald Dahl''s James and the Giant Peach.

      3. Compare the two publication years to determine which book was released earlier.


      Step 1: Michael Crichton''s Jurassic Park was published in 1990.


      Step 2: Roald Dahl''s James and the Giant Peach was published in 1961.


      Step 3: Comparing the two publication years, 1961 (James and the Giant Peach)
      is earlier than 1990 (Jurassic Park).


      Based on the comparison, the answer to whether Michael Crichton''s Jurassic
      Park was released earlier than Roald Dahl''s James and the Giant Peach is: NO'
    f9b28308-327f-4e08-97b1-c98dacc4d127: 'To determine whether Michael
      Crichton''s "Jurassic Park" was released earlier than Roald Dahl''s "James and

      1. **Identify the publication date of "Jurassic Park"**: Michael Crichton''s
      "Jurassic Park" was published in 1990.


      2. **Identify the publication date of "James and the Giant Peach"**: Roald Dahl''s
      "James and the Giant Peach" was published in 1961.


      Now, comparing the publication dates:


      - "James and the Giant Peach" was published in 1961.

      - "Jurassic Park" was published in 1990.


      Since 1961 is earlier than 1990, "James and the Giant Peach" was released earlier
      than "Jurassic Park".


      Therefore, the answer to whether "Jurassic Park" was released earlier than "James
