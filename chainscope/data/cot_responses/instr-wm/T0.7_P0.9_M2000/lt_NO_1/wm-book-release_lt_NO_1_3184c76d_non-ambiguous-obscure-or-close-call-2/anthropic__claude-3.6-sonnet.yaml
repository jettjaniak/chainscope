      - Ron Chernow''s biography of Hamilton was published in 2004

      - This book later inspired Lin-Manuel Miranda to create the musical "Hamilton"


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - 1974 vs 2004

      - 1974 comes before 2004

      - Therefore, "All the President''s Men" was published 30 years before "Alexander
      Hamilton"


      NO - Ron Chernow''s "Alexander Hamilton" was not released earlier than "All
      the President''s Men"'

      - 2017 vs 1986

      - 2017 is later than 1986


      3. The question asks if Tyson''s book was released earlier, so:

      1. The Dark Tower series by Stephen King:

      - The first book, "The Gunslinger," was published in 1982


      2. The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan:

      - This is the first book in The Wheel of Time series

      - It was published in 1990


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - 1982 comes before 1990

      - Therefore, The Dark Tower series started earlier


      NO - The Dark Tower was not released earlier than The Eye of the World. The

      of the World came out in 1990.
