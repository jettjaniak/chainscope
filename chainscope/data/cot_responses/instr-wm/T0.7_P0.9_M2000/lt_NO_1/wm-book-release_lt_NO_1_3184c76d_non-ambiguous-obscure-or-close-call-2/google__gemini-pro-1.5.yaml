    fafaafd6-8807-40a0-9e03-94cb2e03894f: '<think></think>1. **Identify the books
      in question:** We need to find the publication dates of "The Hidden Side of
      Everything" (presumably referring to "Freakonomics" or another book in the series
      co-authored by Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt) and "Built to Last" by James
      C. Collins.


      2. **Freakonomics Publication Date:**  "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores
      the Hidden Side of Everything" was published in 2005.  There might be other
      books in the series with slightly different titles or subtitles, but the original
      and most famous one was released in 2005.


      3. **Built to Last Publication Date:** "Built to Last: Successful Habits of
      Visionary Companies" was published in 1994.


      4. **Compare the dates:** 1994 (Built to Last) is earlier than 2005 (Freakonomics).


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.
