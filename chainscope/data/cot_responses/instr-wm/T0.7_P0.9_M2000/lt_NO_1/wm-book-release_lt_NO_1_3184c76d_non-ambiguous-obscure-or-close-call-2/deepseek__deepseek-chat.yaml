    230df5a1-a989-4fa4-8059-011ef2c0ed75: 'Alright, let''s tackle this
      question step by step to determine whether Richard Dawkins''s *The God Delusion*
      was released earlier than L. Ron Hubbard''s *Dianetics: The Modern Science of
      Mental Health; A Handbook of Dianetic Therapy*. Here''s how I''ll approach it:


      ### Step 1: Identify the Publication Dates


      First, I need to find out the publication years of both books.


      - **The God Delusion** by Richard Dawkins

      - **Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health; A Handbook of Dianetic Therapy**
      by L. Ron Hubbard


      ### Step 2: Research the Publication Date of *The God Delusion*


      I''ll start by looking up when *The God Delusion* was published. From what I
      recall, Richard Dawkins is a well-known author in the field of evolutionary
      biology and atheism, and *The God Delusion* is one of his most famous works.


      After a quick search, I find that *The God Delusion* was published in **2006**.


      ### Step 3: Research the Publication Date of *Dianetics*


      Next, I need to find out when L. Ron Hubbard''s *Dianetics* was published. I
      know that Hubbard is the founder of Scientology, and *Dianetics* is a foundational
      text for the movement.


      Upon checking, I discover that *Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health*
      was first published in **1950**.


      ### Step 4: Compare the Publication Dates


      Now that I have both publication years:


      - *The God Delusion*: 2006

      - *Dianetics*: 1950


      Clearly, **1950** is earlier than **2006**.


      ### Step 5: Formulate the Answer


      Given that *Dianetics* was published in 1950 and *The God Delusion* in 2006,
      *Dianetics* predates *The God Delusion* by several decades.


      ### Conclusion


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Was Richard Dawkins''s *The God Delusion*
      released earlier than L. Ron Hubbard''s *Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental
      Health; A Handbook of Dianetic Therapy*?" is:


      **NO**'

      Now, comparing the two dates:

      question step by step. The goal is to determine whether Martin Handford''s *Where''s
      Wally? The Wonder Book* was released earlier than Judi Barrett''s *Cloudy with
      a Chance of Meatballs*. To answer this, we''ll need to find the publication
      dates of both books and compare them.


      ### Step 1: Identify the Books and Their Authors


      First, let''s confirm the full titles and authors of the books in question:


      - **Book 1:** *Where''s Wally? The Wonder Book* by Martin Handford

      - **Book 2:** *Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs* by Judi Barrett


      ### Step 2: Find the Publication Dates


      Next, we need to find out when each book was first published. This will allow
      us to compare their release dates.


      #### Finding the Publication Date of *Where''s Wally? The Wonder Book*


      *Where''s Wally?* (known as *Where''s Waldo?* in the United States) is a series
      of puzzle books created by Martin Handford. The first book in the series is
      simply titled *Where''s Wally?*, and it was published in 1987. However, the
      specific title mentioned is *Where''s Wally? The Wonder Book*.


      Upon researching, I found that *Where''s Wally? The Wonder Book* is the fourth
      book in the *Where''s Wally?* series. It was published in 1993.


      #### Finding the Publication Date of *Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs*


      *Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs* is a children''s book written by Judi Barrett
      and illustrated by Ron Barrett. My initial thought is that this book was published
      in the late 1970s or early 1980s, but I need to confirm the exact year.


      After checking reliable sources, I discovered that *Cloudy with a Chance of
      Meatballs* was first published in 1978.


      ### Step 3: Compare the Publication Dates


      Now that we have the publication dates:


      - *Where''s Wally? The Wonder Book*: 1993

      - *Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs*: 1978


      Comparing these dates:


      - 1978 (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs) is earlier than 1993 (Where''s Wally?
      The Wonder Book).


      ### Step 4: Conclusion


      Since *Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs* was published in 1978 and *Where''s
      Wally? The Wonder Book* was published in 1993, it''s clear that *Where''s Wally?
      The Wonder Book* was **not** released earlier than *Cloudy with a Chance of
      Meatballs*.

      The problem is to find the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation:

      \[ \frac{1}{a} = \frac{1}{1 + x} + \frac{1}{1 + x} \]


      ## Understanding the Equation

      The equation has two identical fractions on the left side, each being $\frac{1}{1
      + x}$. The goal is to find the value of $x$ that satisfies this equation.


      ## Step 1: Simplify the Equation

      The equation is:

      \[ \frac{1}{a} = \frac{1}{1 + x} + \frac{1}{1 +} \]


      First, notice that the second fraction has a missing term. This suggests that
      it should be $\frac{1}{1 + x}$. So, the corrected equation is:

      \[ \frac{1}{a} = \frac{1}{1 + x} + \frac{1}{1 + x} \]


      ## Step 2: Simplify the Right Side

      Combine the two fractions on the right side:

      \[ \frac{1}{1 + x} + \frac{1}{1 + x} = \frac{2}{1 + x} \]


      So, the equation becomes:

      \[ \frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{1 + x} \]


      ## Step 3: Solve for $x$

      To find $x$, we''ll solve the equation:

      \[ \frac{1}{a} = \frac{2}{1 + x} \]


      Multiply both sides by $(1 + x)$:

      \[ \frac{1}{a} * (1 + x) = 2 \]


      Multiply both sides by $a$:

      \[ (1 + x) = 2a \]


      Subtract 1 from both sides:

      \[ x = 2a - 1 \]


      ## Conclusion

      The value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is:

      \[ x = 2a - 1 \]


      Therefore, the answer is:

      \[ \box{2a - 1} \]

      \n**Brandon Sanderson's *Mistborn: The Final Empire***:\n- This is the first\
      \ book in the *Mistborn* series.\n- I recall that Brandon Sanderson is a contemporary\
      \ author, and *Mistborn* is a relatively recent fantasy series.\n- To be precise,\
      \ I'll look up the publication date.\n\n**Carolyn Keene's *Nancy Drew and the\

      \ Works\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I have the correct books and authors:\n\
      \n- **Brandon Sanderson** is known for his *Mistborn* series, and the first\
      \ book in that series is *Mistborn: The Final Empire*.\n  \n- **Carolyn Keene**\
      \ is the pseudonym used for the authors of the *Nancy Drew* mystery series.\
      \ The first book in this series is *Nancy Drew and the Secret of the Old Clock*.\n\
      \n### Step 2: Find the Publication Dates\n\nNow, I need to find out when each\
      \ of these books was first published.\n\n#### Finding the Publication Date of\
      \ *Mistborn: The Final Empire*\n\nI recall that Brandon Sanderson is a more\
      \ contemporary author compared to Carolyn Keene. To get the exact date, I'll\
      \ search for the publication details of *Mistborn: The Final Empire*.\n\nAfter\
      \ a quick search, I find that *Mistborn: The Final Empire* was first published\
      \ in **2006**.\n\n#### Finding the Publication Date of *Nancy Drew and the Secret\
      \ of the Old Clock*\n\nCarolyn Keene's *Nancy Drew* series is much older. I\
      \ know it's a classic series, but I'm not sure exactly when the first book was\
      \ published. Let's look it up.\n\nUpon checking, I discover that *Nancy Drew\
      \ and the Secret of the Old Clock* was first published in **1930**.\n\n### Step\
      \ 3: Compare the Publication Dates\n\nNow that I have both publication dates:\n\
      \n- *Mistborn: The Final Empire*: 2006\n- *Nancy Drew and the Secret of the\
      \ Old Clock*: 1930\n\n### Step 4: Determine Which Book Was Released Earlier\n\
      \nComparing the two dates:\n\n- 1930 is earlier than 2006.\n\nTherefore, *Nancy\
      \ Drew and the Secret of the Old Clock* was released earlier than *Mistborn:\
      \ The Final Empire*.\n\n### Step 5: Answer the Question\n\nThe question asks:\
      \ **Was Brandon Sanderson's *Mistborn: The Final Empire* released earlier than\
      \ Carolyn Keene's *Nancy Drew and the Secret of the Old Clock*?**\n\nBased on\
      \ the publication dates:\n\n- *Mistborn: The Final Empire*: 2006\n- *Nancy Drew\
      \ and the Secret of the Old Clock*: 1930\n\nSince 2006 is later than 1930, the\
      \ answer is **NO**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter researching the publication dates\
      \ of both books, it's clear that Carolyn Keene's *Nancy Drew and the Secret\
