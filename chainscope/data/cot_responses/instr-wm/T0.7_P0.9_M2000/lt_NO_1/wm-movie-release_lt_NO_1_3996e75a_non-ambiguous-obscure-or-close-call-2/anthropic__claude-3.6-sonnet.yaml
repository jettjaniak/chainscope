      - Aashiqui came in 1990

      - 1990 comes before 2003


      Therefore, since Aashiqui (1990) was released before the Krrish series (which
      started in 2003), the answer is:


      NO'
    ce239e8b-4820-46ea-84a9-d832ac7d4e32: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me check when Aashiqui was released

      - Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui was released in 1990


      2. Now, let me check when the first Krrish movie was released

      - The first movie in the series (Koi... Mil Gaya) was released in 2003

      - Krrish, the second film, was released in 2006

      - Krrish 3 was released in 2013


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Aashiqui: 1990

      - First Krrish series movie: 2003

      - Therefore, Aashiqui came 13 years before the Krrish series began
