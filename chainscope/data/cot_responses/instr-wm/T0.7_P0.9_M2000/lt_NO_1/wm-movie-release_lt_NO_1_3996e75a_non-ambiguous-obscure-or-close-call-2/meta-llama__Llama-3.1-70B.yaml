      let''s first identify the release years of the mentioned movie series and film.


      1. **Rakesh Roshan''s Krrish series**: The first film in the series, "Koi...
      Mil Gaya," was released in 2003, followed by "Krrish" in 2006, "Krrish 3" in
      2013, and "Krrish 4" is announced but not yet released. The series started in
      2003.


      2. **Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui**: The first "Aashiqui" film was released in 1990.
      It was followed by "Aashiqui 2" in 2013, and then "Aashiqui 3" is announced
      but not yet released at the time of my last update. The series started in 1990.


      Given these release years, the "Aashiqui" series began in 1990, while the "Krrish"
      series started in 2003. Therefore, the "Krrish" series was released after the
      "Aashiqui" series began.


      The answer to whether Rakesh Roshan''s Krrish series was released earlier than
      Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui is: **NO**'
    a9e20d93-81cf-402e-a5ab-7eab8b1ac85d: 'To answer this question,
      let''s break down the information step by step:


      1. **Identify the release year of Rakesh Roshan''s Krrish series**: The first
      film in the Krrish series, "Koi... Mil Gaya," was released in 2003. The subsequent
      films, "Krrish" and "Krrish 3," were released in 2006 and 2013, respectively.


      2. **Identify the release year of Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui**: The first film
      in the Aashiqui series, "Aashiqui," was released in 1990. The sequel, "Aashiqui
      2," was released in 2013.


      3. **Compare the release years**: The first film in the Krrish series was released
      in 2003, while the first film in the Aashiqui series was released in 1990.


      Given these steps, it''s clear that Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui was released before
      Rakesh Roshan''s Krrish series.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Rakesh Roshan''s Krrish series was released
      earlier than Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui is: **NO**'
