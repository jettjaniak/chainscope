      1. **Identify the release year of Takashi Shimizu''s The Grudge**: The Grudge,
      directed by Takashi Shimizu, was originally released in 2004 as a remake of
      his own Japanese horror film "Ju-On" from 2002. However, for the sake of this
      comparison, we consider the 2004 release of The Grudge.


      2. **Identify the release year of Shakti Samanta''s Aradhana**: Aradhana, directed
      by Shakti Samanta, is a Bollywood film that was released in 1969.


      3. **Compare the release years**: Now, we compare the release years of the two
      films. The Grudge was released in 2004, and Aradhana was released in 1969.


      Given these steps, it''s clear that Aradhana was released before The Grudge.
      Therefore, The Grudge was not released earlier than Aradhana.


      The answer is: NO'
