      1. First, let''s locate King County, WA:

      - King County is located in Washington state

      - It is in the northwestern part of the United States

      - It contains Seattle and is in the Pacific Northwest region


      2. Next, let''s locate Maricopa County, AZ:

      - Maricopa County is located in Arizona

      - It contains Phoenix and is in the southwestern part of the United States


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Washington state is north of Arizona

      - King County is in the northern part of Washington

      - Maricopa County is in the southern part of Arizona


      4. Reasoning about their relative positions:

      - Since Washington is north of Arizona, and King County is in the northern part
      of Washington

      - This means King County is definitely north of Maricopa County


      5. Therefore, King County is NOT south of Maricopa County.
