      located west of 94133, CA, I need to:


      1. Identify the geographical locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative east-west positions

      3. Give a yes/no answer based on this comparison


      Let me start with identifying the locations:


      10007 is a zip code in New York. Specifically, it''s in Lower Manhattan in New
      York City, New York State, which is on the East Coast of the United States.


      94133 is a zip code in California. It''s in San Francisco, California, which
      is on the West Coast of the United States.


      Now, to determine their east-west positions, I need to consider their positions
      along the longitudinal lines:

      - Locations on the West Coast of the US (like California) are generally around
      120-125 degrees West longitude

      - Locations on the East Coast (like New York) are generally around 70-75 degrees
      West longitude


      The smaller the west longitude number, the further east a location is. The larger
      the west longitude number, the further west a location is.


      So:

      - New York (10007) is around 74 degrees West longitude

      - San Francisco (94133) is around 122 degrees West longitude


      Since 74 is less than 122, New York is east of San Francisco, not west of it.


      Therefore, 10007, NY is NOT located west of 94133, CA. In fact, it''s located
      east of it.


      The answer is NO.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic
      locations of these zip codes and their relative positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 10007 is a zip code in New York, specifically in Lower Manhattan, New York
      City, on the East Coast of the United States.

      - 94133 is a zip code in San Francisco, California, on the West Coast of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative east-west positions.

      - The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west).

      - New York is on the Atlantic (east) side of the country.

      - California is on the Pacific (west) side of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - California is substantially west of New York.

      - Therefore, New York (10007) must be east of California (94133), not west of
      it.


      NO, 10007, NY is not located west of 94133, CA. It''s located east of it.'
    5c6ebd19-c98f-4f66-a52c-c1b1bf7ad4cc: '<think>This question is asking me to determine
      whether a US zip code 10007 in New York (NY) is located west of zip code 94133
      in California (CA).


      To answer this, I need to know the geographical locations (longitude) of these
      zip codes.


      First, let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - New York is on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is on the West Coast of the United States


      So generally speaking, locations in New York are east of locations in California.
      In terms of longitude, New York locations typically have a smaller number (closer
      to 0 or even negative/western longitude) compared to California locations.


      Since 10007 is a zip code in NY (East Coast) and 94133 is a zip code in CA (West
      Coast), it''s highly likely that 10007, NY is located EAST of 94133, CA, not
      west.


      To be more specific:

      - Zip code 10007 is in Manhattan, New York City, NY (East Coast)

      - Zip code 94133 is likely in San Francisco or another California city (West
      Coast)


      Given the continental geography of the United States where NY is on the East
      Coast and CA is on the West Coast, 10007, NY would be EAST of 94133, CA, not
      west.


      So the answer is NO, 10007, NY is not located west of 94133, CA. It is located
      east of it.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      First, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes:

      - 10007 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 94133 is a zip code in California (CA)


      Next, I need to recall the geographic orientation of these states:

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States


      In the United States, when considering east-west positioning:

      - States on the West Coast (like California) are west of states on the East
      Coast (like New York)

      - Moving from east to west, you would go from New York toward California, not
      the other way around


      Therefore, New York (including zip code 10007) is positioned to the east of
      California (including zip code 94133), not to the west of it.

      First, I need to understand the general geographic orientation of the United
      States. The US spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific Ocean
      on the west. In general:

      - East Coast states like New York are in the eastern part of the country

      - West Coast states like California are in the western part of the country


      New York (NY) is located on the East Coast of the United States, while California
      (CA) is located on the West Coast of the United States.


      Since California is on the West Coast and New York is on the East Coast, California
      is west of New York (and conversely, New York is east of California).


      Therefore, 10007, NY (which is in New York) would be EAST of 94133, CA (which
      is in California), not west of it.

      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 10007 is in New York (NY)

      - 94133 is in California (CA)

      \ in California (CA).\n\nTo answer this, I need to determine the geographical\
      \ locations of these two zip codes and compare their east-west positioning.\n\
      \nFirst, let me recall what I know about US geography:\n- The continental United\
      \ States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific Ocean on the\
      \ west.\n- New York is a state on the east coast of the United States.\n- California\
      \ is a state on the west coast of the United States.\n\nIn terms of longitude\
      \ (which measures east-west position):\n- Eastern states like New York have\
      \ higher longitude values (closer to 0\xB0 from the west)\n- Western states\
      \ like California have lower longitude values (further from 0\xB0 from the west)\n\
      \nGiven this general knowledge:\n- 10007 is a zip code in New York (NY), which\
      \ is on the east coast\n- 94133 is a zip code in California (CA), which is on\
      \ the west coast\n\nSince California is on the west coast and New York is on\
      \ the east coast, locations in California are generally west of locations in\
      \ New York.\n\nTherefore, 10007, NY would be EAST of 94133, CA, not west of\
      \ it.\n\nSo the answer is NO, 10007, NY is not located west of 94133, CA.\n\n\
      Actually, I should double-check this. In the US, west longitudes are used, which\
      \ means the numbering goes from around 67\xB0 (west) for Maine to around 124\xB0\
      \ (west) for Washington state. Lower numbers are further east, and higher numbers\
      \ are further west.\n\nSo:\n- East coast (like NY) has lower longitude numbers\
      \ (around 70-80\xB0 west)\n- West coast (like CA) has higher longitude numbers\
      \ (around 120-125\xB0 west)\n\nTherefore, my reasoning stands. 10007, NY would\
      \ be at a lower longitude number than 94133, CA, which means NY is east of CA,\
      \ not west.\n\nThe answer is NO.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nTo determine\
      \ if 10007, NY is west of 94133, CA, I need to understand the geographic positioning\
      \ of these zip codes.\n\n1) First, I'll identify the locations:\n   - 10007\
      \ is a zip code in New York (NY), specifically in Lower Manhattan\n   - 94133\
      \ is a zip code in California (CA), specifically in San Francisco\n\n2) Looking\
      \ at the continental United States map:\n   - New York is located on the East\
      \ Coast\n   - California is located on the West Coast\n   - The United States\
      \ generally spans from east (Atlantic Ocean) to west (Pacific Ocean)\n\n3) In\
      \ terms of longitude (which measures east-west position):\n   - New York is\
      \ approximately around 74\xB0 West longitude\n   - California is approximately\
      \ around 122\xB0 West longitude\n   - Lower longitude numbers in the western\
      \ hemisphere indicate more eastern positions\n\n4) Therefore, New York (10007)\
      \ is east of California (94133), not west of it.\n\n# Answer: NO\n\n10007, NY\
      \ is not located west of 94133, CA. It is located east of it."

      \ step by step:\n\n1. We need to determine if 10014, NY is located west of 70116,\

      \nSince a higher west longitude number means further west, and 90\xB0 W is larger\

      I need to figure out if zip code 10014, NY is located west of zip code 70116,

      First, I need to identify these locations:

      - 10014 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 70116 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)


      To determine which is west of the other, I need to consider their relative positions
      on a map of the United States.


      New York is on the east coast of the United States, near the northeastern corner
      of the country.

      Louisiana is in the southeastern part of the United States, along the Gulf of
      Mexico.


      Looking at a US map, New York is east of Louisiana. This means that any location
      in New York (including zip code 10014) would be east of any location in Louisiana
      (including zip code 70116).


      Since New York is east of Louisiana, zip code 10014 in NY is east of zip code
      70116 in LA, not west of it.

      Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of these states.

      New York is located on the east coast of the United States.

      Louisiana is located in the southern part of the United States, along the Gulf

      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      On a map of the United States, New York is clearly east of Louisiana. The entire
      state of New York lies to the east of Louisiana.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      Since 10014 is in New York and 70116 is in Louisiana, and New York is east of
      Louisiana, it follows that 10014 is east of 70116, not west.

      1. First, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. 10019, NY refers to a zip code in New York

      3. 94027, CA refers to a zip code in California

      4. Then I need to determine which one is further west


      In the United States, California is on the west coast, while New York is on
      the east coast. The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean
      (east) to the Pacific Ocean (west).


      California is on the western edge of the continental US, bordering the Pacific

      2. Determine the geographical location (specifically longitude) of 94301, CA

      3. Compare the two longitudes to determine which is further west


      Let me think about the US geography:

      - New York is on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is on the West Coast of the United States


      Generally speaking, locations in California are west of locations in New York.


      For ZIP code 10023, this is in New York, NY (Manhattan, specifically in the
      Upper West Side area).

      For ZIP code 94301, this is in Palo Alto, CA (in the San Francisco Bay Area).


      Since California is on the West Coast and New York is on the East Coast, ZIP
      code 94301 in California is west of ZIP code 10023 in New York.


      So the answer to "Is 10023, NY located west of 94301, CA?" is NO.


      Actually, let me double-check this. "West of" means further west, or having
      a more negative longitude in the Western Hemisphere (or smaller longitude value,
      since western longitudes in the US are expressed as negative numbers).


      California is west of New York. So ZIP code 94301 (Palo Alto, CA) would have
      a more western (more negative) longitude than ZIP code 10023 (New York, NY).


      Therefore, 10023, NY is NOT located west of 94301, CA. In fact, it''s the opposite

      - 94301 is a ZIP code in Palo Alto, California (in the San Francisco Bay Area)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States

      - The continental United States spans from east to west, with the East Coast
      being the easternmost part and the West Coast being the westernmost part


      Step 3: Compare the locations

      - California is west of New York

      - Therefore, Palo Alto, CA (94301) is west of New York, NY (10023)

      - This means New York, NY (10023) is east of Palo Alto, CA (94301), not west

      Therefore, 10023, NY is NOT located west of 94301, CA. It''s located east of
      it.


      The answer is NO.</think>To determine if 10023, NY is located west of 94301,
      CA, I need to identify where these zip codes are located and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10023 is a zip code in New York (NY), specifically in Manhattan, New York
      City on the East Coast of the United States.

      - 94301 is a zip code in California (CA), specifically in Palo Alto in the San
      Francisco Bay Area on the West Coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      - The United States extends from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west).

      - New York is located on the Atlantic side (East Coast).

      - California is located on the Pacific side (West Coast).


      Step 3: Determine relative position.

      - California is west of New York, not the other way around.

      - Moving from New York to California, you travel westward across the country.

      - Moving from California to New York, you travel eastward across the country.


      NO, 10023, NY is not located west of 94301, CA. It is located east of it.'

      the geographical locations of two US zip codes: 10023, NY and 94301, CA.


      Let me first identify where these zip codes are located:


      10023, NY is a zip code in New York. Based on my knowledge, this is likely in
      New York City, probably in Manhattan.


      94301, CA is a zip code in California. I believe this is in the San Francisco
      Bay Area, possibly Palo Alto.


      Now, to determine if 10023, NY is west of 94301, CA, I need to consider the
      general geography of the United States:


      - The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west)

      - New York is on the east coast

      - California is on the west coast


      Therefore, New York (including zip code 10023) is located east of California
      (including zip code 94301), not west of it.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10023 is a ZIP code in New York (NY), likely in Manhattan, New York City.

      - 94301 is a ZIP code in California (CA), specifically in Palo Alto in the San
      Francisco Bay Area.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the United States.

      - The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east coast) to
      the Pacific Ocean (west coast).

      - New York is located on the east coast.

      - California is located on the west coast.


      Step 3: Compare the locations.

      - California is the westernmost state of the continental US.

      - New York is much further east, approximately 3,000 miles east of California.

      - Therefore, 10023, NY is east of 94301, CA (not west of it).

      \ to determine the relative geographical positions of these two ZIP codes.\n\
      \n1) First, let's identify the states:\n   - 11976 is in New York (NY)\n   -\
      \ 55425 is in Minnesota (MN)\n\n2) Let's consider the general geographic locations\
      \ of these states:\n   - New York is located on the East Coast of the United\
      \ States\n   - Minnesota is located in the Midwest, considerably west of New\
      \ York\n\n3) Looking at the ZIP code patterns:\n   - ZIP codes starting with\
      \ \"1\" are typically in the northeastern United States\n   - ZIP codes starting\
      \ with \"5\" are typically in the central/midwest United States\n\n4) Specifically,\
      \ 11976 appears to be on Long Island in New York, while 55425 is in the Minneapolis\
      \ area of Minnesota.\n\n5) New York has approximate longitudes around 73-74\xB0\
      W, while Minnesota has approximate longitudes around 93-94\xB0W.\n\nSince points\
      \ with larger western longitude values are further west in North America, Minnesota\
      \ is west of New York, not the other way around.\n\n# Answer: NO"

      \ In the United States, locations are generally described by longitude (east-west\
      \ position) and latitude (north-south position). Lower longitude numbers indicate\
      \ more westerly locations.\n\n3. Geographically speaking, Minnesota is in the\

      \nActually, I should verify the specific zip codes rather than just relying\

    5e36d8a3-78a5-497d-b239-bd5a123f7e29: '<think>Let''s solve this step-by-step.


      First, I need to recognize what these zip codes represent:

      - 10012, NY is a zip code in New York

      - 94043, CA is a zip code in California


      To determine which is west of the other, I need to think about the geographic
      locations of New York and California in the United States.


      The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific Ocean
      on the west. New York is located on the east coast, facing the Atlantic Ocean.
      California is located on the west coast, facing the Pacific Ocean.


      Therefore, California is west of New York. This means that any location in California
      (including 94043) would be west of any location in New York (including 10012).


      But wait - the question asks if 10012, NY is west of 94043, CA. That would be
      asking if New York is west of California, which is not correct.


      So the answer is NO, 10012, NY is NOT located west of 94043, CA. In fact, it''s
      the opposite - 94043, CA is located west of 10012, NY.</think># Step-by-Step
      Reasoning


      First, I need to identify the locations:

      - 10012 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 94043 is a zip code in California (CA)


      Next, I need to consider the geographic positions of these states within the
      United States:

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States


      Since the United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west), California is geographically west of New York.


      Therefore, any zip code in California (including 94043) would be west of any
      zip code in New York (including 10012), not the other way around.

      To determine the answer, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      Let me think about this:


      10036 is a zip code in New York (NY). New York is on the east coast of the United
      States.

      90265 is a zip code in California (CA). California is on the west coast of the
      United States.


      In the United States, locations on the east coast (like New York) are east of
      locations on the west coast (like California). In other words, California is
      west of New York.


      So if 10036 is in New York, and 90265 is in California, then 10036 is east of
      90265, not west of it.


      The question asks if 10036, NY is located west of 90265, CA. The answer is NO,
      it''s actually east of it.

      - Zip code 10036 is in Manhattan, New York City, NY (east coast)

      - 10036 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 90265 is a zip code in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States


      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship.

      - The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the
      Pacific Ocean (west)

      - California is at the western edge, while New York is at the eastern portion

      - All of New York is east of all of California


      Step 4: Specifically, zip code 10036 is in Manhattan, New York City, while 90265

      located west of 90265, CA, I need to find the locations of these zip codes and
      compare their geographical positions.


      10036 is a zip code in New York, NY. New York is on the East Coast of the United
      States.

      90265 is a zip code in California, CA. California is on the West Coast of the
      United States.


      In the United States, the East Coast is east of the West Coast. This means that
      locations on the East Coast (like New York) are east of locations on the West
      Coast (like California).


      So 10036, NY is located east of 90265, CA, not west of it.


      Another way to think about it is to consider longitude. Locations in the western
      United States have larger negative longitudes than locations in the eastern
      United States. For example, New York City is around longitude -74 degrees, while
      locations in California are around longitude -118 to -124 degrees. A more negative
      longitude indicates a more westerly location.


      Since New York (10036) has a less negative (or more positive) longitude than
      California (90265), New York is east of California, not west of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, 10036, NY is not located west of 90265, CA.</think>#
      Step-by-Step Reasoning


      First, I need to identify where these zip codes are located:


      1) 10036 is a zip code in New York (NY), which is located on the East Coast
      of the United States.


      2) 90265 is a zip code in California (CA), which is located on the West Coast
      of the United States.


      Looking at the geography of the United States:

      - The West Coast (California) is on the western edge of the continental US

      - The East Coast (New York) is on the eastern edge of the continental US

      - California is west of New York, which means New York is east of California


      Since 10036 (NY) is on the East Coast and 90265 (CA) is on the West Coast, the
      New York location is east of the California location, not west of it.

      2. 90265 is a zip code in California (CA)

      3. I need to determine if 10036 (NY) is located west of 90265 (CA)


      To answer this, I need to understand the relative geographic positions of these
      zip codes. In the United States:

      - The East Coast includes New York

      - The West Coast includes California

      - Generally, moving from east to west in the US means going from the Atlantic
      Ocean toward the Pacific Ocean


      California is on the West Coast of the United States, while New York is on the

      Since 10036 is in New York (East Coast) and 90265 is in California (West Coast),
      10036 would be EAST of 90265, not west of it.

      \ 11954 is a zip code in New York (NY).\n- 90028 is a zip code in California\

      \ East Coast of the United States.\n- California is located on the West Coast\
      \ of the United States.\n\nStep 3: Determine which location is more westward.\n\
      In terms of longitude, the West Coast (California) is more westward (has a higher\
      \ negative longitude) than the East Coast (New York). This is because in the\
      \ northern hemisphere, longitudes increase in negative value as you go west.\n\
      \nLooking at a general map of the United States:\n- California is approximately\

      \ is likely a zip code in Los Angeles, California.\n\nGiven that New York is\
      \ on the East Coast and California is on the West Coast, and the Earth is generally\
      \ recognized to be a sphere (or oblate spheroid) with the Prime Meridian at\
      \ 0\xB0 longitude going through Greenwich, England, we can definitively state\
      \ that any point in California would be more westward than any point in New\
      \ York, within the context of the continental United States.\n\nActually, I\
      \ need to be careful about the question. It's asking if 11954, NY is located\

      \ Los Angeles, California. The approximate longitude for Hollywood, CA is around\
      \ 118.3\xB0 W.\n\nSince 72.5\xB0 W is less negative than 118.3\xB0 W, it confirms\

      Let me reason through this step by step:


      First, I need to identify where these zip codes are located:


      1. 11954 is a zip code in New York (NY). New York is on the East Coast of the
      United States.

      2. 90028 is a zip code in California (CA). California is on the West Coast of
      the United States.


      Generally, locations in New York are east of locations in California, since
      the continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west).


      Looking at a map of the US, California is located on the western edge of the
      continental US, while New York is on the eastern edge. So any location in NY
      would be east of any location in CA, not west.


      Therefore, 11954, NY is NOT located west of 90028, CA. Rather, it is located
      east of it.


      Actually, let me double-check this with more specificity:


      ZIP code 11954 appears to be in Suffolk County, NY, which is on Long Island,
      definitely on the East Coast of the US.


      ZIP code 90028 appears to be in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles, CA, which

      Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if 11954, NY is located west of 90028, CA, I need to analyze the
      geographical positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 11954 is a zip code in New York (NY) state

      - 90028 is a zip code in California (CA) state


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - Moving from west to east across the continental United States, we encounter
      California before New York

      - Any location in New York state is east of any location in California, not
      west


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on these facts.

      - Since NY is on the East Coast and CA is on the West Coast, 11954 (NY) must
      be east of 90028 (CA), not west of it

      - 11954, NY: This is a zip code in New York state

      - 90028, CA: This is a zip code in California state


      Step 2: Determine the relative east/west positioning

      In the United States, California is on the west coast, while New York is on
      the east coast. The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean
      (east) to the Pacific Ocean (west).


      Generally speaking:

      - California is on the west coast


      Therefore, any location in New York would typically be east of any location
      in California.


      Step 3: Answer the specific question

      The question asks if 11954, NY is located west of 90028, CA.


      Since New York is east of California, 11954, NY would be east of 90028, CA,

      To determine if 11954, NY is west of 90028, CA, I need to identify where these
      zip codes are located and then compare their geographical positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 11954 is in New York (NY)

      - 90028 is in California (CA)


      ## Step 2: Determine relative geographic positions

      In the United States, New York is located on the east coast, while California
      is located on the west coast of the continental United States.


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positioning

      California is significantly west of New York on any US map. All New York zip
      codes are east of California zip codes.


      Since 11954, NY is in New York (east coast) and 90028, CA is in California (west
      coast), the New York zip code cannot be west of the California zip code.

      Let me break this down:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      2. Determine their relative east-west positioning.

      3. Answer whether 10011, NY is west of 90210, CA.


      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 10011 is a zip code in New York (NY). New York is on the east coast of the
      United States.

      - 90210 is a zip code in California (CA). California is on the west coast of
      the United States.


      In the United States, locations on the east coast (like New York) are east of
      locations on the west coast (like California). This is because the continental
      United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific Ocean
      on the west.


      Given this geography:

      - New York is east of California

      - Therefore, 10011, NY is east of 90210, CA

      - Conversely, 90210, CA is west of 10011, NY


      So to answer the question "Is 10011, NY located west of 90210, CA?", the answer

      To determine if one zip code is west of another, I need to identify their locations
      and compare their geographical positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10011 is a zip code in New York (NY), which is on the East Coast of the United
      States.

      - 90210 is a zip code in Beverly Hills, California (CA), which is on the West
      Coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positioning.

      In the United States, the continental landmass spans from the Atlantic Ocean
      (east) to the Pacific Ocean (west). California is on the western edge near the
      Pacific, while New York is on the eastern edge near the Atlantic.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion.

      Since California is on the West Coast and New York is on the East Coast, California
      is west of New York. Therefore, 10011, NY is east of 90210, CA (not west of
      it).

      First, I need to identify the locations for these zip codes:

      - 10011, NY: This is a zip code in New York City, specifically in Manhattan

      - 90210, CA: This is a famous zip code in Beverly Hills, California


      Now I need to determine their relative east-west positioning. In the United
      States:

      - States on the east coast (like New York) are located east of states on the
      west coast (like California)

      - New York is on the east coast

      - California is on the west coast


      Since New York is on the east coast and California is on the west coast, New
      York is located EAST of California.


      Therefore, 10011, NY is located EAST of 90210, CA, not WEST.


      The question asks if 10011, NY is located WEST of 90210, CA.

      The answer is NO.</think>I''ll solve this step-by-step:

      of a location with the zip code 90210 in California (CA).


      To answer this, I need to determine the east-west positioning of these two locations
      relative to each other. In the United States, locations are generally oriented
      with the East Coast on the right (east) side of the map and the West Coast on
      the left (west) side.


      Let''s identify these zip codes:

      - 10011 is a zip code in New York, specifically in Manhattan, New York City,
      which is on the East Coast of the United States.

      - 90210 is a famous zip code in Beverly Hills, California, which is on the West
      Coast of the United States.


      In terms of geographic orientation, California is located on the west coast
      of the United States, while New York is on the east coast. This means that California,
      including Beverly Hills (90210), is west of New York, including Manhattan (10011).


      Therefore, 10011, NY is NOT located west of 90210, CA. In fact, it''s the opposite:

      ## Step 2: Compare their east-west positions

      In the United States, California is positioned on the west coast, while New
      York is positioned on the east coast. The continental United States spans from
      the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean (east).


      ## Step 3: Determine the answer

      10013 in New York is west of zip code 70130 in Louisiana.


      To answer this question, I need to:

      1. Identify the geographic locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative east-west positions

      3. Decide if 10013 (NY) is west of 70130 (LA)


      First, let me establish general geographic knowledge:

      - New York is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Louisiana is in the southern part of the United States, along the Gulf of
      Mexico

      - Generally, New York is east of Louisiana


      Now for the specific zip codes:

      - 10013 is in New York City, specifically in Manhattan (parts of SoHo, Tribeca,
      etc.)

      - 70130 is in New Orleans, Louisiana


      Looking at the United States from west to east:

      - West Coast states (CA, OR, WA) are the westernmost

      - Then come mountain and central states

      - Then Louisiana in the south-central region

      - Then eastern states including New York on the east coast


      So New York (including 10013) is east of Louisiana (including 70130), not west.


      Therefore, 10013, NY is NOT located west of 70130, LA. It''s located to the
      east.


      The answer is NO.</think># Is 10013, NY located west of 70130, LA?


      Let me determine this by finding the geographic locations of these zip codes
      and comparing their positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 10013 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York (NY)

      - 70130 is a zip code in New Orleans, Louisiana (LA)


      ## Step 2: Determine relative east-west positioning

      In the United States, locations are generally organized with:

      - East Coast states (including New York) on the eastern edge

      - Gulf states like Louisiana more centrally located

      - West Coast states on the western edge


      New York is on the East Coast, while Louisiana is in the south-central part
      of the country. Looking at longitude, New York is further east than Louisiana.


      ## Step 3: Make the comparison

      Since New York (10013) is located on the East Coast and Louisiana (70130) is
      west of it, the New York zip code cannot be west of the Louisiana zip code.


      NO'

    d202ec7b-e26d-4f95-a4ea-c702b5f3a49f: '<think>Alright, I need to determine if
      the location with zip code 10013 in New York is west of the location with zip
      code 70130 in Louisiana.


      To solve this problem, I need to find the geographical coordinates (longitude
      and latitude) of both zip codes, and then compare their longitudes to determine
      which one is further west.


      In the western hemisphere, locations further west have a larger negative longitude
      value (or a smaller positive longitude value). So if the longitude of 10013,
      NY is less than (more negative than) the longitude of 70130, LA, then 10013,
      NY is located west of 70130, LA. Otherwise, it''s not.


      Let me recall what I know about these locations:


      Zip code 10013 is in New York, NY. New York is on the east coast of the United
      States.

      Zip code 70130 is in Louisiana, LA. Louisiana is in the southern United States,
      along the Gulf of Mexico.


      Given the general geography of the United States, New York is typically east
      of Louisiana. So I would initially guess that 10013, NY is NOT west of 70130,
      LA.


      However, to be thorough, let me try to recall more specific information about
      these zip codes:


      Zip code 10013 appears to be in Manhattan, New York City, New York.

      Zip code 70130 appears to be in New Orleans, Louisiana.


      Manhattan is definitely on the east coast of the United States, and New Orleans
      is more centrally located along the Gulf Coast. Again, this suggests that Manhattan
      (10013) is east of New Orleans (70130), not west.


      To confirm, let''s consider the approximate longitudes:

      - New York City is roughly around longitude -74 degrees (74 degrees west).

      - New Orleans is roughly around longitude -90 degrees (90 degrees west).


      Since -90 is less than (more negative than) -74, New Orleans is west of New
      York City.


      Therefore, zip code 10013, NY is NOT located west of 70130, LA. Rather, it''s
      located east of it.


      So the answer is NO.


      Actually, let me double-check the longitudes of these specific zip codes to
      be completely certain, but I believe the answer is NO based on the general geography
      of the United States.


      Zip code 10013 (Manhattan, New York, NY) is approximately at longitude -74 degrees.

      Zip code 70130 (New Orleans, Louisiana, LA) is approximately at longitude -90
      degrees.


      Since -74 > -90, zip code 10013 is east of zip code 70130, not west.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, 10013, NY is NOT located west of 70130, LA.</think>#
      Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if 10013, NY is west of 70130, LA, I need to compare the geographic
      positions of these two zip codes.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 10013 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York

      - 70130 is a zip code in New Orleans, Louisiana


      Next, I need to consider their relative positions on the map of the United States:

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Louisiana is located in the southern part of the country, along the Gulf of
      Mexico


      Looking at longitudinal positions (which determine east-west placement):

      - Manhattan, NY has an approximate longitude of around -74 degrees

      - New Orleans, LA has an approximate longitude of around -90 degrees


      Since more negative longitude values indicate locations further west in the
      Northern Hemisphere, and -90 is more negative than -74, New Orleans (70130)
      is west of Manhattan (10013), not the other way around.

      of 70130, LA.


      Let''s think about the general geography of the United States:

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States.

      - Louisiana is located in the southern part of the United States, more toward
      the center of the country, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.


      Based on the general geography of the United States, New York is east of Louisiana.
      Therefore, the zip code 10013, NY would be east of the zip code 70130, LA, not
      west of it.


      So the answer is NO, 10013, NY is not located west of 70130, LA. It is located
      east of it.</think># Is 10013, NY located west of 70130, LA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 10013 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 70130 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Louisiana is located in the southern United States, much further west than
      New York


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      In the US, locations further east have higher longitude values than locations
      further west. New York is significantly east of Louisiana on the US map.


      NO - 10013, NY is not west of 70130, LA. It is east of it.'

      if the US zip code 33139, FL (Florida) is located west of 89109, NV (Nevada).


      To answer this question, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes
      and then determine their relative east-west positioning.


      33139 is a zip code in Florida (FL). Florida is located in the southeastern
      United States, on the east coast.


      89109 is a zip code in Nevada (NV). Nevada is located in the western United
      States.


      When we consider the geography of the United States:

      - Florida is on the east coast

      - Nevada is in the western part of the country

      - States to the west have higher longitude values (going from east to west,
      longitude increases)


      Since Florida is on the east coast and Nevada is in the west, Florida is east
      of Nevada, not west of it.


      Therefore, 33139, FL is not located west of 89109, NV. It''s actually east of

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Florida is located on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Nevada is located in the western United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - United States geography shows that Florida is significantly east of Nevada

      - The entire state of Florida is east of Nevada


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Florida (where 33139 is located) is east of Nevada (where 89109 is located),
      the Florida zip code cannot be west of the Nevada zip code.

      33139 is a zip code in Florida (FL). Florida is located in the southeastern
      United States, on the east coast.

      89109 is a zip code in Nevada (NV). Nevada is located in the western United
      States.


      Generally, locations in the eastern United States have longitudes that are further

      western United States. Since Florida is on the east coast and Nevada is in the
      west, it''s very likely that 33139, FL is east of 89109, NV, not west of it.


      To be more specific:

      - 33139 appears to be a zip code for Miami Beach, Florida, which is on the Atlantic
      coast

      - 89109 appears to be a zip code in Las Vegas, Nevada, which is in the western
      part of the United States


      Looking at their relative positions on a map of the United States, Florida is

      Therefore, 33139, FL would be east of 89109, NV, not west of it.


      So the answer would be NO, 33139, FL is not located west of 89109, NV. It is

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 33139 is a zip code in Florida (FL), specifically in Miami Beach.

      - 89109 is a zip code in Nevada (NV), specifically in Las Vegas.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Florida is located on the southeastern coast of the United States.

      - Nevada is located in the western United States.


      Step 3: Compare east-west positioning.

      - States in the western US (like Nevada) have larger longitude values in their
      zip codes.

      - States in the eastern US (like Florida) have smaller longitude values.

      - Moving from east to west across the US, Florida is significantly east of Nevada.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Florida is east of Nevada on the US map, zip code 33139 (FL) is east of
      zip code 89109 (NV), not west of it.


      NO, 33139, FL is not located west of 89109, NV.'

      1. 33139, FL

      2. 89109, NV


      Specifically, it''s asking if the first zip code (33139, FL) is located west
      of the second zip code (89109, NV).


      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographical locations of these
      zip codes.


      33139 is a zip code in Florida (FL). Florida is on the east coast of the United
      States.


      89109 is a zip code in Nevada (NV). Nevada is in the western United States.


      Generally speaking, states on the east coast (like Florida) are east of states
      in the western US (like Nevada). In other words, Nevada is west of Florida,
      not the other way around.


      So, 33139, FL is east of 89109, NV, not west of it.


      The answer is NO, 33139, FL is not located west of 89109, NV.</think># Reasoning
      about US Zip Code Locations


      To determine if 33139, FL is located west of 89109, NV, I need to find the geographical
      locations of these zip codes.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 33139 is a zip code in Miami Beach, Florida (FL)

      - 89109 is a zip code in Las Vegas, Nevada (NV)


      Next, I need to consider their positions on the US map:

      - Florida is located on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Nevada is located in the western United States


      Looking at their relative positions:

      - Florida is in the eastern part of the country

      - Nevada is significantly west of Florida


      Since Florida (where 33139 is located) is east of Nevada (where 89109 is located),
      it cannot be west of Nevada.


      NO, 33139, FL is not located west of 89109, NV.'

      33139, FL refers to a zip code in Florida.

      89109, NV refers to a zip code in Nevada.


      To determine if one location is west of another, I need to compare their longitudes.
      A lower (more negative) longitude in the western hemisphere means the location

      Let me recall the approximate locations of these states:

      - Florida is on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Nevada is in the western United States


      Generally speaking, Nevada is west of Florida. The entire state of Nevada is
      west of the entire state of Florida on a map of the United States.


      To be more specific about these zip codes:

      - 33139 is a zip code in Miami Beach, Florida, which is on the eastern coast
      of Florida

      - 89109 is a zip code in Las Vegas, Nevada, which is in the southern part of
      Nevada


      Since Nevada is west of Florida, and these specific zip codes don''t change
      that general geographic relationship, 33139, FL is NOT west of 89109, NV. Rather,
      89109, NV is west of 33139, FL.

      Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if 33139, FL is west of 89109, NV, I need to identify where these
      ZIP codes are located and compare their positions on a map.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 33139 is a ZIP code in Miami Beach, Florida

      - 89109 is a ZIP code in Las Vegas, Nevada


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - Florida is located on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Nevada is located in the western United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the
      Pacific Ocean in the west. Florida is near the Atlantic (eastern) side, while
      Nevada is much closer to the Pacific (western) side.


      Step 4: Make the east-west determination.

      Nevada is significantly west of Florida on any map of the United States. This
      means that any location in Nevada (including Las Vegas) will be west of any
      location in Florida (including Miami Beach).

      The question asks if 10003, NY is located west of 90069, CA.


      First, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes:

      - 10003 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 90069 is a zip code in California (CA)


      In the United States, California is on the west coast, while New York is on
      the east coast. The continental United States spans roughly from the Pacific
      Ocean on the west to the Atlantic Ocean on the east.


      California is significantly west of New York in terms of longitude. In fact,
      California is one of the westernmost states, while New York is toward the eastern
      side of the country.


      Since 10003 is in New York and 90069 is in California, and California is west
      of New York, this means that 10003, NY is NOT west of 90069, CA. Rather, 10003,
      NY is EAST of 90069, CA.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      When looking at a map of the United States, California is significantly west

      of US zip codes, this is likely in New York City, specifically in Manhattan.


      90069, CA - This is a zip code in California. Given the 9xxxx format, this is
      in California, likely in the Los Angeles area.


      Now, to determine which is west of the other, I need to understand the general

      and the Atlantic Ocean on its east coast. California is on the west coast, while
      New York is on the east coast.


      So generally speaking, any location in California is going to be west of any
      location in New York.


      Therefore, 10003, NY (New York) is NOT west of 90069, CA (California). Rather,

      New York City

      2) 90069, CA - This is a zip code in California, likely in the Los Angeles area


      Next, I need to consider the geographic orientation of the United States:

      - The Pacific Ocean lies to the west

      - The Atlantic Ocean lies to the east

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States


      In terms of longitude, all of California lies west of all of New York. This
      means that any zip code in California (including 90069) is west of any zip code
      in New York (including 10003).


      For a location A to be west of location B, A must be to the west of B on a map.
      In this case, New York (10003) is not west of California (90069) - it''s the

    e1fb6fc1-1bde-4cd2-a830-68063b2c40d8: '<think>OK, I need to determine if 10003,
      NY is located west of 90069, CA. Let me break this down step by step.


      First, let me identify these zip codes:

      - 10003 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 90069 is a zip code in California (CA)


      In the United States, New York is on the east coast, and California is on the
      west coast. The continental United States generally spans from the Atlantic
      Ocean on the east to the Pacific Ocean on the west.


      Looking at a map of the US from west to east:

      - West Coast (Pacific Ocean): California, Oregon, Washington

      - Middle: Many states including Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, etc.

      - East Coast (Atlantic Ocean): States like New York, New Jersey, etc.


      Since New York is on the east coast and California is on the west coast, New
      York is east of California.


      Therefore, 10003, NY is not west of 90069, CA. Rather, it''s east of it.


      So my answer is NO.</think>I need to determine if a zip code in New York is
      west of a zip code in California.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 10003 is a zip code in New York (NY), which is on the East Coast of the United
      States.

      - 90069 is a zip code in California (CA), which is on the West Coast of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic layout of the United States.

      In the continental United States, the East Coast (including New York) is to
      the east, and the West Coast (including California) is to the west.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      Since New York is on the East Coast and California is on the West Coast, New
      York is east of California, not west of it.


      NO'

      To determine whether one zip code is west of another, I need to find their geographic
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations associated with these zip codes.

      - 11201, NY is in Brooklyn, New York

      - 90291, CA is in Venice, Los Angeles, California


      Step 2: Determine the relative east-west positioning of these locations.

      In the United States, California is on the west coast, while New York is on
      the east coast. California is generally west of New York.


      More specifically:

      - Brooklyn, NY (11201) is on the east coast

      - Venice, CA (90291) is on the west coast


      Since the continental United States spans from west to east (Pacific Ocean to
      Atlantic Ocean), California locations are west of New York locations.


      Therefore, 11201, NY (Brooklyn) is NOT located west of 90291, CA (Venice). Rather,
      11201, NY is EAST of 90291, CA.


      The answer is NO.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positioning
      of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 11201, NY is a zip code in Brooklyn, New York

      - 90291, CA is a zip code in Venice, Los Angeles, California


      Step 2: Determine their geographic positions.

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      The United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean
      (east). California is significantly west of New York on the map. Brooklyn, NY
      (11201) is thousands of miles east of Venice, CA (90291).


      Therefore, 11201, NY is NOT west of 90291, CA. It is east of it.

      2. Figure out where 90291, CA is located (which city/region)

      3. Compare their east-west positioning


      Step 1: Identifying 11201, NY

      Zip code 11201 is in Brooklyn, New York. Brooklyn is a borough of New York City,
      which is located on the East Coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Identifying 90291, CA

      States.


      Step 3: Comparing positions

      The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (East Coast) to the Pacific
      Ocean (West Coast). New York is on the East Coast, while California is on the

    b89efeb5-6c4b-44a7-b741-f65222e79c62: "<think>To answer this question, I need\
      \ to determine the geographical locations of the zip codes 11201, NY and 90291,\
      \ CA, and then determine which one is farther west.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\
      \n1. First, I need to identify what locations these zip codes correspond to:\n\
      \   - 11201, NY: This is a zip code in New York state, likely in New York City.\n\
      \   - 90291, CA: This is a zip code in California, likely in the Los Angeles\
      \ area.\n\n2. Next, I need to compare their longitudes to determine which is\
      \ farther west. In the United States:\n   - Locations on the east coast (like\
      \ New York) are generally around 70-80 degrees west longitude.\n   - Locations\
      \ on the west coast (like California) are generally around 115-125 degrees west\
      \ longitude.\n\nThe continental United States spans roughly from longitude 67\xB0\
      W (Maine) to 124\xB0W (Washington). The more western a location, the larger\
      \ its west longitude number.\n\nSince 11201 is in New York (on the east coast)\
      \ and 90291 is in California (on the west coast), California is definitely farther\
      \ west than New York.\n\nSpecifically:\n- New York (east coast): ~74\xB0 W longitude\n\
      - California (west coast): ~118\xB0 W longitude\n\nSo, 90291, CA is west of\
      \ 11201, NY.\n\nActually, to double-check, let me be more specific about these\
      \ zip codes:\n\n- 11201, NY: This is in Brooklyn, New York City, NY, which is\
      \ on the east coast.\n- 90291, CA: This is in Venice, Los Angeles, CA, which\
      \ is on the west coast.\n\nThe continental US spans from east to west, with\
      \ the east coast (including New York) being on the Atlantic Ocean side and the\
      \ west coast (including California) being on the Pacific Ocean side. California\
      \ is definitely west of New York.\n\nSo, is 11201, NY located west of 90291,\
      \ CA? No, it's the opposite. 11201, NY is on the east coast, and 90291, CA is\
      \ on the west coast. So 11201, NY is east of 90291, CA, not west of it.</think>#\
      \ Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nTo determine if 11201, NY is west of 90291, CA,\
      \ I need to identify the locations of these zip codes and compare their positions.\n\
      \n1. Identifying the locations:\n   - 11201, NY is a zip code in Brooklyn, New\
      \ York City\n   - 90291, CA is a zip code in Venice, Los Angeles, California\n\
      \n2. Comparing geographical positions:\n   - New York is located on the east\
      \ coast of the United States\n   - California is located on the west coast of\
      \ the United States\n   - The continental United States spans from east (Atlantic\
      \ Ocean) to west (Pacific Ocean)\n\n3. Determining relative position:\n   -\
      \ California is significantly west of New York\n   - This means that 90291,\
      \ CA is west of 11201, NY (not the other way around)\n\n# Answer: NO\n\n11201,\
      \ NY is NOT located west of 90291, CA. It's actually the opposite - 11201, NY\
      \ is located east of 90291, CA."
