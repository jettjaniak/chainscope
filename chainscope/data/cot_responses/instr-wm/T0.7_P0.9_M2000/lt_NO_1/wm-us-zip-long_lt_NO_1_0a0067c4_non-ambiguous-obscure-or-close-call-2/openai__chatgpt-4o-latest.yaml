      - ZIP code 10012 is in New York City, specifically in Manhattan.

      - ZIP code 94043 is in Mountain View, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area.


      **Step 2: Understand US geography**

      - The state of California is on the West Coast of the United States.


      **Step 3: Compare longitudes**

      - Longitudes increase going west to east. So locations with higher (more positive
      or less negative, depending on the convention) longitudes are further east.

      - New York City (10012) has a longitude of approximately -74 degrees.

      - Mountain View, CA (94043) has a longitude of approximately -122 degrees.
