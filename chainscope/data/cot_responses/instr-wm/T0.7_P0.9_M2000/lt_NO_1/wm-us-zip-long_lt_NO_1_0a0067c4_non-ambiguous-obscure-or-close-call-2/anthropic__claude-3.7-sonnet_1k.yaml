      if the zip code 10007 in New York is located west of the zip code 94133 in California.


      To answer this, I need to know the geographic positions of these zip codes.
      Let me think about this in terms of U.S. geography.


      Zip code 10007 is in New York (NY), which is on the east coast of the United
      States.

      Zip code 94133 is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the United
      States.


      Generally speaking, locations in New York are east of locations in California,
      since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast.


      This means that 10007, NY would be east of 94133, CA, not west of it.


      So the answer would be NO, 10007, NY is not located west of 94133, CA. Instead,
      it''s located east of it.</think>I need to determine if a New York zip code
      is west of a California zip code.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10007 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 94133 is a zip code in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, California is clearly west of
      New York

      - Therefore, New York (including zip code 10007) is east of California (including
      zip code 94133)

      - This means 10007, NY cannot be west of 94133, CA

      First, I need to identify the locations:

      - 10007, NY is a zip code in New York. Based on my knowledge, this is in Manhattan,
      New York City.

      - 94133, CA is a zip code in California. This appears to be in San Francisco.


      Now, in the United States, California is on the west coast, while New York is
      on the east coast. Geographically speaking, locations in California are generally
      west of locations in New York.


      So if we''re asking if 10007, NY is west of 94133, CA, we need to determine
      if New York is west of California, which it is not. New York is east of California.


      Therefore, 10007, NY is not located west of 94133, CA; it''s located east of

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10007 is a zip code in New York, specifically in Lower Manhattan, New York
      City.

      - 94133 is a zip code in California, specifically in the North Beach/Chinatown
      area of San Francisco.


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these locations within the United
      States.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the
      Pacific Ocean (west).

      - California is near the Pacific Ocean on the western edge of the country.

      - New York is near the Atlantic Ocean on the eastern edge of the country.

      - Therefore, New York is east of California, not west of it.

      1. Identify where these zip codes are located geographically

      2. Determine which one is further west

      3. Answer the question with YES or NO


      Let me think about the locations:


      Zip code 10007 is in New York (NY). New York is on the East Coast of the United
      States.

      Zip code 94133 is in California (CA). California is on the West Coast of the
      United States.


      In the United States, locations on the West Coast (like California) are generally
      west of locations on the East Coast (like New York).


      Since California is west of New York, zip code 94133 in CA would be west of
      zip code 10007 in NY.

      States.

      - 94133 is a zip code in California (CA), which is on the West Coast of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west).

      - New York is situated on the eastern side of the country.

      - California is situated on the western side of the country.


      Step 3: Determine the answer.

      - Since California is west of New York, zip code 94133 (CA) is west of zip code

      step.


      1) I need to determine the locations of two zip codes: 10019, NY and 94027,
      CA.


      2) 10019 is a zip code in New York (NY). New York is on the East Coast of the
      United States.


      3) 94027 is a zip code in California (CA). California is on the West Coast of
      the United States.


      4) In the United States, the West Coast is west of the East Coast. So California
      is west of New York.


      5) Since 10019 is in New York (east) and 94027 is in California (west), 10019
      is east of 94027, not west of it.


      6) The question asks if 10019, NY is located west of 94027, CA. Based on my
      reasoning, the answer is no.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative positions of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 10019 is a zip code in New York (NY), which is located on the East Coast of
      the United States.

      - 94027 is a zip code in California (CA), which is located on the West Coast
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      - The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west).

      - New York is on the Atlantic (eastern) side of the country.

      - California is on the Pacific (western) side of the country.


      Step 3: Make the determination.

      - California is west of New York, not the other way around.

      - Therefore, 10019 (NY) is east of 94027 (CA), not west of it.


      NO'
    8b2c25ca-51ca-4a1c-ad9c-16065ec2bd33: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the locations of these zip codes and compare their east-west positions.


      10019, NY is a zip code in New York. New York is on the east coast of the United
      States.

      94027, CA is a zip code in California. California is on the west coast of the
      United States.


      In the United States, going from east to west, the states are roughly ordered
      as:

      - East Coast (including New York)

      - Midwest

      - Mountain states

      - West Coast (including California)


      So California is generally west of New York. This means that 94027, CA would
      be west of 10019, NY, not the other way around.


      To be absolutely certain, I can also note that:

      - East coast zip codes tend to start with lower numbers (0-3)

      - West coast zip codes tend to start with higher numbers (9)


      This confirms that 10019 (starting with 1) is an east coast zip code, and 94027
      (starting with 9) is a west coast zip code.</think>I''ll solve this step by
      step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 10019 is a zip code in New York (NY), which is on the East Coast of the United
      States

      - 94027 is a zip code in California (CA), which is on the West Coast of the
      United States


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - In the United States, California is located to the west of New York

      - The continental US generally spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west)

      - New York is near the Atlantic Ocean, while California borders the Pacific
      Ocean


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - All of New York state is east of all of California state

      - Therefore, any zip code in NY would be east of any zip code in CA

      - This means 10019, NY is east of 94027, CA (not west)

      and locations for these zip codes:


      - 10019, NY: This is a zip code in New York, likely in New York City

      - 94027, CA: This is a zip code in California


      The question is asking if 10019 (New York) is located west of 94027 (California).


      In the United States, New York is on the east coast, while California is on
      the west coast. The continental United States generally runs from east (Atlantic
      Ocean) to west (Pacific Ocean).


      California is the westernmost state of the contiguous United States, while New
      York is much further east.


      Since California is west of New York, a zip code in New York (10019) cannot
      be west of a zip code in California (94027). Instead, it would be east of the
      California zip code.</think>I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 10019 is in New York (NY), specifically in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.

      - 94027 is in California (CA), specifically in Atherton, near San Francisco.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic orientation of the United States.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States.

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Moving from east to west across the US, you would go from New York to California.

      - Therefore, New York (including zip code 10019) is east of California (including
      zip code 94027).

      - Conversely, California is west of New York.


      NO. 10019, NY is not located west of 94027, CA. It is located east of it.'
    ad7e4e9d-ca1c-446b-b81f-efaa33c90419: '<think>To answer this question about zip
      codes, I need to determine the locations of these two zip codes and their relative
      positions.


      Given information:

      - 10019, NY (New York)

      - 94027, CA (California)


      I need to figure out if 10019 in New York is west of 94027 in California.


      In the United States, zip codes generally increase from east to west. New York
      is on the east coast, while California is on the west coast. Since the continental
      United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean (west),
      California is generally west of New York.


      So 10019 in New York would be on the east coast, and 94027 in California would
      be on the west coast. This means that 10019, NY is EAST of 94027, CA (not west).


      For more specific confirmation:

      - 10019 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York City, NY, which is on the east
      coast.

      - 94027 is likely a zip code in California, which is on the west coast.


      Therefore, 10019, NY is NOT west of 94027, CA. It is east of it.</think>I need
      to determine the relative locations of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 10019 is in New York (NY)

      - 94027 is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Determine the general geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      California is west of New York in the continental United States. Therefore,
      New York cannot be west of California - it''s east of California.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      Since 10019 is in New York and 94027 is in California, 10019 must be east of
      94027, not west of it.

      the Pacific Ocean on the west. New York is on the Atlantic side (east), while
      California is on the Pacific side (west).


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      In the United States, locations in California are generally west of locations
      in New York because California is on the west coast while New York is on the
      east coast.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      To determine whether 10023, NY is west of 94301, CA, I need to know their geographical
      locations.


      New York is on the east coast of the United States, while California is on the
      west coast. Generally speaking, locations in New York are east of locations
      in California, not west.


      The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west). New York borders the Atlantic Ocean, while California borders
      the Pacific Ocean.


      So 10023, NY would be to the east of 94301, CA, not to the west.</think>I need
      to determine whether a New York zip code is west of a California zip code.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - 10023 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 94301 is a zip code in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of New York and California in the
      United States.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Determine relative positions.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, California is clearly west of
      New York

      - This means New York is east of California, not west of it


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific zip codes.

      - Since 10023 is in New York, and 94301 is in California, the New York zip code
      must be east of the California zip code, not west of it


      NO'

      is located west of 94301, CA.


      First, let me identify these locations:

      - 10023 is a zip code in New York (NY). New York is on the east coast of the
      United States.

      - 94301 is a zip code in California (CA). California is on the west coast of
      the United States.


      In the United States, locations on the east coast (like New York) are east of
      locations on the west coast (like California). The continental United States
      spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean (west), with the east
      coast states like New York being on the eastern side and west coast states like
      California being on the western side.


      Since New York is on the east coast and California is on the west coast, a zip
      code in NY (10023) would be east of a zip code in CA (94301), not west of it.</think>To
      determine if 10023, NY is located west of 94301, CA, I need to consider the
      geographic positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 10023 is a zip code in New York (NY), which is on the east coast of the United
      States.

      - 94301 is a zip code in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic orientation of the United States.

      - The continental US spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west).

      - New York is located on the eastern side of the country.

      - California is located on the western side of the country.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Since New York is on the east coast and California is on the west coast, any
      location in New York would be east of (not west of) any location in California.

      - 94301 is a ZIP code in California (CA)


      In the United States, New York is on the east coast, and California is on the
      west coast. The continental United States generally spans from the Atlantic
      Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean (west).


      Since New York is on the east coast and California is on the west coast, New
      York (including ZIP code 10023) is east of California (including ZIP code 94301),
      not west of it.


      Therefore, 10023, NY is NOT located west of 94301, CA. It is located east of

      First, let''s think about the geography of the United States:

      - NY stands for New York, which is a state on the east coast of the United States.

      - CA stands for California, which is a state on the west coast of the United
      States.


      In general, locations in New York are east of locations in California because
      the United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west), with New York being close to the Atlantic and California being close
      to the Pacific.


      To be more specific:

      - Zip code 10023 is in New York City, New York

      - Zip code 94301 is in Palo Alto, California


      Given the general geography of the United States, a location in New York would
      be east of a location in California, not west of it.

      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of these states.

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic
      Ocean (east)

      - California borders the Pacific Ocean on the west

      - New York is much further east, closer to the Atlantic Ocean


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      - Any location in New York (including zip code 10023) would be east of, not
      west of, any location in California (including zip code 94301)

      New York (NY) is on the East Coast of the United States.

      Minnesota (MN) is in the Midwest of the United States.


      Typically, locations in New York would be east of locations in Minnesota, not
      west. This is because New York is further east in the country compared to Minnesota.


      To be west of something means to have a higher longitude (less negative) than

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 11976 is in New York (NY)

      - 55425 is in Minnesota (MN)


      ## Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Minnesota is located in the Midwest, significantly west of New York


      ## Step 3: Apply geographic knowledge

      The continental United States generally spans from east to west, with:

      - Eastern states (like New York) being farther east

      - Midwestern states (like Minnesota) being farther west


      Since Minnesota is west of New York, zip code 55425 in Minnesota must be west
      of zip code 11976 in New York.


      Therefore, 11976, NY is NOT located west of 55425, MN. It is located EAST of
      it.


      NO'
    e41ab001-e285-4bfe-8440-a951a734eab5: '<think>To determine if 11976, NY is located
      west of 55425, MN, I need to find the geographical locations of these zip codes
      and compare their longitudes.


      11976 is a zip code in New York state (NY).

      55425 is a zip code in Minnesota state (MN).


      In the United States, locations in the east have lower longitude values than
      locations in the west. So if 11976, NY is west of 55425, MN, then 11976 would
      have a higher longitude value than 55425.


      However, based on general US geography, New York is located on the east coast
      of the United States, while Minnesota is in the upper Midwest. This means that
      New York is generally east of Minnesota, not west of it.


      So 11976, NY should be east of 55425, MN, which means it has a lower longitude
      value, not a higher one.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of
      these two zip codes by identifying their locations and comparing them.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 11976 is in New York (NY)

      - 55425 is in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Minnesota is located in the Upper Midwest region


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - The United States generally runs from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west)

      - New York, being on the East Coast, is positioned further east than Minnesota

      - Minnesota, being in the Midwest, is positioned further west than New York


      Step 4: Make the determination

      - Since New York is east of Minnesota, zip code 11976 (NY) must be east of zip
      code 55425 (MN)

      - If 11976 is east of 55425, then it cannot be west of 55425

      Then I''ll determine if one is west of the other.


      First, let me identify the locations of these zip codes:


      11976, NY - This is a zip code in New York state (NY).

      55425, MN - This is a zip code in Minnesota state (MN).


      Now, I need to determine their relative east-west positioning. In the US, the
      geography is such that:

      - East Coast states like New York are in the eastern part of the country

      - Midwestern states like Minnesota are in the central part of the country, west
      of New York


      Minnesota is west of New York. Therefore, a zip code in Minnesota (55425, MN)
      would be west of a zip code in New York (11976, NY).


      So actually, 11976, NY is EAST of 55425, MN. Or in other words, 55425, MN is
      WEST of 11976, NY.


      Therefore, 11976, NY is NOT located west of 55425, MN.</think>I''ll think through
      this step-by-step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 11976 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 55425 is a zip code in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Minnesota is located in the Midwest region, considerably west of New York


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Minnesota is west of New York in the United States

      - Therefore, a zip code in Minnesota would be west of a zip code in New York

      - This means 55425, MN is west of 11976, NY (not the other way around)


      NO (11976, NY is not located west of 55425, MN - it''s actually east of it)'

      1) 10012 is a zip code in NY (New York)

      2) 94043 is a zip code in CA (California)


      The question is asking whether 10012, NY is located west of 94043, CA.


      To determine this, I need to recall the general geographical orientation of
      the United States. The US spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific
      Ocean on the west.


      New York is a state on the east coast of the United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      California is a state on the west coast of the United States, bordering the
      Pacific Ocean.


      Therefore, California is west of New York. This means that locations in California
      are generally west of locations in New York.


      Since 10012 is in New York and 94043 is in California, 10012 is east of 94043,
      not west of it.</think># Reasoning about US Zip Code Locations


      To answer this question, I need to identify the locations and determine their

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 10012 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 94043 is a zip code in California (CA)


      ## Step 2: Recall US geography

      The United States is oriented with the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast and
      the Pacific Ocean on the west coast.

      - New York is located on the east coast

      - California is located on the west coast


      ## Step 3: Determine the relationship

      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, California
      is west of New York.


      This means that any location in New York (including zip code 10012) is EAST
      of any location in California (including zip code 94043), not west of it.

      Looking at the geography of the United States:

      - New York is on the East Coast

      The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west). New York borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east, while California
      borders the Pacific Ocean on the west.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Apply directional knowledge.

      - Moving west from the East Coast would take you toward the West Coast

      - California is approximately 3,000 miles west of New York


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since New York is east of California, a zip code in New York (10012) cannot
      be west of a zip code in California (94043)

      2. Determine their relative east/west positioning


      Zip code 10036, NY:

      This is a New York zip code. New York is on the East Coast of the United States.
      Specifically, 10036 is in Manhattan, New York City.


      Zip code 90265, CA:

      This is a California zip code. California is on the West Coast of the United
      States. I believe 90265 is in Malibu, California.


      Geographic positioning:

      - New York is located in the eastern part of the United States

      - California is located in the western part of the United States

      - The continental United States spans from east to west, with the East Coast
      (including New York) being east of the West Coast (including California)

      NY is located west of 90265, CA. Let me break this down:


      1. First, I need to identify where these zip codes are located

      2. Then I need to determine their relative positions (east/west)


      For 10036, NY:

      This is a zip code in New York. New York is on the east coast of the United
      States.

      10036 specifically is in Manhattan, New York City.


      For 90265, CA:

      This is a zip code in California. California is on the west coast of the United

      90265 is Malibu, California.


      In terms of geography in the United States:

      - The west coast (California) is west of the east coast (New York)

      - California is west of New York

      - Therefore, Malibu, CA (90265) is west of Manhattan, NY (10036)

      To determine if 10036, NY is west of 90265, CA, I need to:

      1) Identify these zip code locations

      2) Compare their east-west positions


      ## Step 1: Identifying the locations

      - 10036 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York

      - 90265 is a zip code in Malibu, California


      ## Step 2: Comparing east-west positions

      - The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west)

      - New York is located on the east coast of the US

      - California is located on the west coast of the US

      - California is therefore west of New York, not east of it


      ## Step 3: Coming to a conclusion

      Since California (where 90265 is) is west of New York (where 10036 is), that
      means 10036 is EAST of 90265, not west of it.

      is located west of 90265, CA.


      Step 1: Let me identify where these zip codes are located.

      - 10036 is a zip code in New York, NY. New York is on the East Coast of the
      United States.

      - 90265 is a zip code in California, CA. California is on the West Coast of
      the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the United States.

      The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific Ocean
      on the west. New York is on the Atlantic (east) side, while California is on
      the Pacific (west) side.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      In the United States, west and east are determined by longitude, where lower
      longitudes are further east and higher longitudes are further west. New York
      has a lower longitude than California because it''s on the east coast while
      California is on the west coast.


      Therefore, New York (10036) is EAST of California (90265), not west of it.</think>To
      determine if 10036, NY is west of 90265, CA, I need to consider the geographic
      locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10036 is a zip code in New York (NY), which is located on the East Coast of
      the United States.

      - 90265 is a zip code in California (CA), which is located on the West Coast
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic orientation of the United States.

      The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west). New York is on the eastern side near the Atlantic, while California
      is on the western side near the Pacific.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      Since New York is on the East Coast and California is on the West Coast, New
      York is east of California, not west of it.

      the locations associated with these zip codes and determining their relative
      positions.


      10036 is a zip code in New York (NY). Without looking up the exact location,
      I know that New York is on the East Coast of the United States.


      90265 is a zip code in California (CA). California is on the West Coast of the
      United States.


      The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west). New York is close to the Atlantic Ocean on the east side, while
      California is close to the Pacific Ocean on the west side.


      Therefore, any location in New York would be east of any location in California,
      not west.


      To double-check, I can recall that:

      - Areas in the eastern US generally have lower zip codes

      - Areas in the western US generally have higher zip codes

      - 10036 (New York) is a much lower number than 90265 (California), which aligns
      with the east-to-west pattern of US zip codes


      So 10036, NY is located east of 90265, CA, not west of it.</think>I need to

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - The United States spans from east (Atlantic Ocean) to west (Pacific Ocean)

      - New York is on the eastern side of the country

      - California is on the western side of the country

      - Therefore, New York is east of California (not west)


      Step 4: Verify with zip code patterns.

      - US zip codes generally start with lower numbers in the east and higher numbers
      in the west

      - 10036 (NY) has a much lower number than 90265 (CA), confirming NY is eastward

      Generally speaking, the United States spans from east to west, with the East
      Coast (including New York) on the eastern side and the West Coast (including
      California) on the western side. So generally, locations in New York are east
      of locations in California, not west.


      But let me be specific about these zip codes:


      11954 is a zip code in New York. New York is on the East Coast of the United
      States.

      90028 is a zip code in California. California is on the West Coast of the United
      States.


      Looking at a map of the US, California is clearly west of New York. So a zip
      code in New York (11954) would be east of a zip code in California (90028),
      not west of it.


      So the answer is NO, 11954, NY is not located west of 90028, CA. It''s actually
      east of it.</think>I need to determine if zip code 11954 in New York is located

      - 11954 is in New York (NY)

      - 90028 is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, California is significantly west
      of New York

      - The entire state of New York is east of California

      - Therefore, any zip code in New York would be east of any zip code in California

      First, let me identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 11954 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 90028 is a zip code in California (CA)


      In terms of US geography, California is on the west coast of the United States,
      while New York is on the east coast. The continental United States spans from
      the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean (east).


      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, New

      90210 is a zip code in California (CA)


      Generally, California is located on the west coast of the United States, while
      New York is on the east coast. This means that California is west of New York,
      or equivalently, New York is east of California.


      More specifically:

      - 10011 corresponds to an area in Manhattan, New York City, NY

      - 90210 corresponds to Beverly Hills, CA


      Since New York is east of California on a map of the United States, 10011 (NY)
      would be east of 90210 (CA), not west.


      Therefore, 10011, NY is NOT located west of 90210, CA. It''s located east of
      it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two

      - 10011 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 90210 is a zip code in Beverly Hills, California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of New York and California within
      the United States.

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - California (including Beverly Hills) is significantly west of New York

      - New York is east of California, not west


      Since New York is east of California on a map of the United States, zip code
      10011 in NY is east of zip code 90210 in CA, not west of it.

      First, let me identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 10011 is in New York (NY), specifically in Manhattan, New York City

      - 90210 is in California (CA), specifically in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles


      Now, to determine which is further west, I need to think about the geography
      of the United States:

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States

      - California is on the west coast of the United States


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), California is always west of
      New York. The entire state of California is west of the entire state of New
      York.


      So, 10011 (NY) cannot be west of 90210 (CA). Rather, 90210 (CA) is west of 10011

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of these states within the US.

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - California is significantly west of New York.

      - All locations in California (including Beverly Hills) are west of all locations
      in New York (including Manhattan).


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion.

      Since 10011 is in New York (east coast) and 90210 is in California (west coast),
      10011 is east of 90210, not west of it.

      33139 in Florida is located west of zip code 89109 in Nevada.


      First, I''ll identify the general locations:

      - 33139 is in Florida (FL)

      - 89109 is in Nevada (NV)


      In the United States, Florida is located in the southeastern part of the country,
      on the east coast. Nevada is located in the western part of the country, not
      quite on the west coast but in the western region.


      Generally speaking, states in the western US have higher first digits in their
      zip codes, and states in the eastern US have lower first digits. This is consistent
      with what we see here: Florida''s zip code starts with 3, while Nevada''s starts
      with 8.


      Given the general geography of the United States, Florida is east of Nevada.
      Therefore, zip code 33139 in Florida would be east of zip code 89109 in Nevada,
      not west of it.</think>To determine if 33139, FL is located west of 89109, NV,
      I need to understand the geographic positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 33139 is in Florida (FL)

      - 89109 is in Nevada (NV)


      Step 2: Determine their general locations within the US

      - Florida is located on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Nevada is located in the western part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      - Nevada is significantly west of Florida

      - The US postal zip code system generally assigns lower numbers to the eastern
      parts of the country and higher numbers to the western parts, which is consistent
      with Florida (33xxx) being east and Nevada (89xxx) being west


      Step 4: Make the determination

      - Since Florida is east of Nevada on the US map, zip code 33139 in Florida must
      be east of zip code 89109 in Nevada, not west of it

      89109 is a zip code in Nevada (NV). Nevada is located in the western United
      States.


      In the United States, locations are generally considered "west" if they have
      a lower longitude (more negative longitude value). The west coast is around
      -124 degrees longitude, while the east coast is around -75 degrees longitude.


      Since Florida is on the east coast and Nevada is in the western part of the
      country, Nevada would be west of Florida. This means that 89109, NV would be

      - Nevada is significantly west of Florida on any US map

      - The continental US generally spans from west to east, with Nevada being much
      closer to the west coast than Florida


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Nevada is west of Florida, zip code 89109 (NV) is west of zip code 33139

      Let me identify these zip codes:

      - 33139, FL is located in Miami Beach, Florida

      - 89109, NV is located in Las Vegas, Nevada


      Looking at the US map, Nevada is considerably west of Florida. Florida is on
      the eastern coast of the US, while Nevada is in the western part of the country.


      So, 33139, FL (Miami Beach) would be EAST of 89109, NV (Las Vegas), not west

      First, I need to identify what these zip codes represent:

      - 10003 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 90069 is a zip code in California (CA)


      Now I need to think about the geographic locations of these places in the United
      States:

      - New York is on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is on the West Coast of the United States


      Generally speaking, locations in California are west of locations in New York,
      because California is farther west in the country.


      So 10003, NY would be east of 90069, CA, not west of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.</think>To determine if 10003, NY is located west
      of 90069, CA, I need to consider the geographic positions of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10003 is a zip code in New York (NY), which is on the East Coast of the United
      States.

      - 90069 is a zip code in California (CA), which is on the West Coast of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship.

      - The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west).

      - New York is located on the eastern side of the country.

      - California is located on the western side of the country.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - California is west of New York in terms of geographic position.

      - Therefore, a zip code in New York (10003) would be east of a zip code in California
      (90069), not west of it.

      First, let me identify these zip codes:

      - 10003 is in New York (NY)

      - 90069 is in California (CA)


      In the US, the states are generally arranged so that:

      - Eastern states (like New York) are on the East Coast

      - Western states (like California) are on the West Coast


      California is on the west coast of the United States, while New York is on the
      east coast. This means that California is west of New York, not the other way
      around.


      Therefore, New York (including zip code 10003) is EAST of California (including

      - 10003 is a zip code in New York (NY), which is on the East Coast of the United
      States.

      - 90069 is a zip code in California (CA), which is on the West Coast of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on a US map.

      - The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the
      Pacific Ocean (west).

      - New York is located on the eastern side of the country.

      - California is located on the western side of the country.


      Step 3: Make the determination.

      - California is west of New York, not the other way around.

      - Therefore, 10003 (NY) is east of 90069 (CA), not west of it.

      - 90069 is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      - Moving from east to west across the United States, you would encounter New
      York first, then California.

      - This means New York is east of California, not west of it.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific ZIP codes.

      To solve this problem, I need to know the geographic locations (specifically,
      the east-west positioning) of these zip codes.


      Let me identify each location:

      - 10003 is in New York (NY). New York is on the East Coast of the United States.

      - 90069 is in California (CA). California is on the West Coast of the United
      States.


      In the United States, states on the East Coast (like New York) are east of states
      on the West Coast (like California). The continental US spans from the Atlantic
      Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean (west).


      Since New York is on the East Coast and California is on the West Coast, New
      York is east of California, not west of it.

      Step 1: Identify the general locations of these states.

      - New York (NY) is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - California (CA) is located on the West Coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between these states.

      - In the continental United States, the West Coast (California) is west of the
      East Coast (New York).

      - This means New York is east of California, not west of it.


      Step 3: Regardless of the specific locations of these zip codes within their
      respective states, a zip code in New York cannot be west of a zip code in California
      due to their positions on opposite coasts.


      NO. Zip code 10003, NY is not located west of 90069, CA. It is located east

      to determine the geographical locations of two zip codes and compare them:

      1. 11201, NY

      2. 90291, CA


      First, let me identify what states these are in:

      - 11201 is in New York (NY)

      - 90291 is in California (CA)


      Generally speaking, New York is on the east coast of the United States, while
      California is on the west coast. In terms of longitude, locations on the east
      coast (like New York) are east of locations on the west coast (like California).


      Since 11201 is in New York (east coast) and 90291 is in California (west coast),
      11201 would be east of 90291, not west.


      So, is 11201, NY located west of 90291, CA? No, it''s the opposite - 11201,
      NY is located east of 90291, CA.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 11201 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 90291 is a zip code in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of New York and California within
      the United States.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions in terms of east-west orientation.

      - The East Coast (including New York) is east of the West Coast (including California)

      - This means that any location in NY would be east of, not west of, any location
      in CA


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      - Since 11201, NY is in New York on the East Coast, and 90291, CA is in California
      on the West Coast, the NY zip code is east of the CA zip code.

      1. Identify where 11201, NY is located

      2. Identify where 90291, CA is located

      3. Determine which is further west


      Let me work on each step:


      1. 11201 is a zip code in New York. New York is on the East Coast of the United
      States. Specifically, 11201 is in Brooklyn, New York City.


      2. 90291 is a zip code in California. California is on the West Coast of the
      United States. Specifically, 90291 is in Venice, Los Angeles.


      3. Now I need to determine which is further west. The United States spans from
      the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean (west). California is along the
      Pacific Ocean, making it much further west than New York, which is along the
      Atlantic Ocean.


      Given the geography of the United States, any location in California (west coast)
      will be west of any location in New York (east coast).


      So, is 11201, NY located west of 90291, CA? No, it''s the opposite. 11201, NY

      Step 1: Identify 11201, NY

      This is a zip code in Brooklyn, New York, which is located on the East Coast
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify 90291, CA

      This is a zip code in Venice, Los Angeles, California, which is located on the
      West Coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions

      The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west). New York is on the Atlantic (East) side, while California is on the
      Pacific (West) side.


      Step 4: Make the determination

      Since California is on the West Coast and New York is on the East Coast, any

      The United States is oriented such that:

      - The East Coast (including New York) is on the eastern side of the country

      - 90291 is a zip code in Venice/Los Angeles, California (CA), located on the
      West Coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on the US map.

      The United States extends from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west). New York is on the Atlantic (eastern) side, while California is on the
      Pacific (western) side.


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      California is located west of New York in the United States. This means that
