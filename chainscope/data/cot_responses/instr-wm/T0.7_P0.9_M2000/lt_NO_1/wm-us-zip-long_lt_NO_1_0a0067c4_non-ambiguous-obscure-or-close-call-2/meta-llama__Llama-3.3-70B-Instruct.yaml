      1. **Identify the states**: 11976 is a zip code in New York (NY), and 55425
      is a zip code in Minnesota (MN).

      2. **General geography of the US**: The United States is generally divided into

      York is located on the East Coast, while Minnesota is located in the Midwestern
      part of the country but is still west of New York.

      3. **Compare locations**: Since New York is on the East Coast and Minnesota
      is to the west of New York in the broader geographical context of the United
      States, any location in New York would be east of any location in Minnesota.

      4. **Conclusion**: Given that 11976, NY is in New York and 55425, MN is in Minnesota,
      and knowing that New York is east of Minnesota, 11976, NY cannot be west of

      (MN).

      2. **General geographical knowledge**: New York is generally east of Minnesota
      in the United States. This is because the U.S. is often divided into regions
      such as the East Coast, where New York is located, and the Midwest, where Minnesota
      is found. The East Coast is to the east of the Midwest.

      3. **Specific locations**: Without needing the exact longitude, we know that
      New York (11976) is on the East Coast, and Minnesota (55425) is in the interior
      of the country, more towards the central part but definitely west of the East
      Coast.

      4. **Conclusion based on geographical location**: Given that New York is on
      the East Coast and Minnesota is more central, it means that Minnesota (55425)

      we need to understand the general geographic locations associated with the given
      zip codes and their respective states.


      1. **Identify the states**: The first step is to identify the states associated

      and the zip code 55425 is located in the state of Minnesota (MN).


      2. **General geographic location of the states**: Next, we need to know the
      general geographic locations of these states. New York is located on the East
      Coast of the United States, while Minnesota is located in the Midwestern United
      States, more towards the center of the northern part of the country.


      3. **Compare east-west positions**: Given the general locations, New York (NY)
      is east of Minnesota (MN). This is because the East Coast refers to the eastern
      seaboard of the United States, which is east of the Midwest where Minnesota
      is situated.


      4. **Determine the answer**: Since 11976, NY is on the East Coast and 55425,
      MN is in the Midwest, 11976, NY is not west of 55425, MN. Instead, it is east.
