      - 10003 is in New York City (Manhattan)

      - 90069 is in West Hollywood, California


      2) When comparing east/west locations in the US:

      - California is on the West Coast


      3) Therefore:

      - 10003 (NY) is located on the East Coast

      - 90069 (CA) is located on the West Coast

      - Any point in New York is east of any point in California


      4) Since the question asks if NY is west of CA:

      - And we know NY is east of CA

      - The answer must be no
