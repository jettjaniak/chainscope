      \ California is roughly around 34 degrees north latitude\n\nWait, I think I\

      \ The CIA headquarters is indeed in Langley, Virginia, not Maryland. The question\

      \ the \"George Bush Center for Intelligence\" in 1999 after George H.W. Bush,\
      \ but it is in Virginia, not Maryland.\n\nLangley, Virginia (where the CIA headquarters\
      \ is) is approximately at latitude 38.9\xB0 N.\nBeverly Hills, California is\
      \ approximately at latitude 34.1\xB0 N.\n\nSince a lower latitude number in\

      , The Beverly Hills Hotel is SOUTH of the George Bush Center for Intelligence.\n\
      \nTherefore, the George Bush Center for Intelligence is NOT south of The Beverly\

      - Lower latitude numbers mean further south\n\nSo:\n- George Bush Center for\

      \ ~34.1\xB0 N (California)\n\nSince 38.9\xB0 N is higher than 34.1\xB0 N, the\
      \ CIA headquarters is NORTH of The Beverly Hills Hotel. Conversely, The Beverly\
      \ Hills Hotel is SOUTH of the CIA headquarters.\n\nTherefore, to answer the\
      \ question \"Is George Bush Center for Intelligence, MD located south of The\

      \ for Intelligence is lower than the latitude of The Beverly Hills Hotel, then\
      \ it is south of it. Otherwise, it's not.\n\nFirst, let me clarify what these\
      \ places are:\n\n1. George Bush Center for Intelligence, MD - This is the headquarters\
      \ of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), located in Langley, Virginia (not\
      \ Maryland actually, but let me continue with the reasoning). It's named after\
      \ George H.W. Bush.\n\n2. The Beverly Hills Hotel, CA - This is a famous luxury\

      \ latitudes:\n\nThe United States generally spans from around 25\xB0N to 49\xB0\

      \ 39\xB0N. Langley, Virginia where the CIA headquarters is located is in northern\
      \ Virginia, probably around 38-39\xB0N.\n\nBased on these approximate latitudes:\n\
      - The Beverly Hills Hotel in California: ~34\xB0N\n- George Bush Center for\
      \ Intelligence in Virginia: ~38-39\xB0N\n\nSince a higher latitude number means\
      \ further north, and the George Bush Center for Intelligence has a higher latitude,\
      \ it is located NORTH of The Beverly Hills Hotel, not south.\n\nWait, let me\
      \ check if I might be mixing up the locations. The question refers to the \"\
      George Bush Center for Intelligence, MD\" suggesting it's in Maryland, not Virginia.\
      \ Let me reconsider.\n\nThe CIA headquarters (George Bush Center for Intelligence)\
      \ is actually located in Langley, Virginia, not Maryland. But if we're talking\
      \ about a different George Bush Center for Intelligence that's in Maryland,\
      \ Maryland is still on the east coast and is north of California in terms of\
      \ latitude. Maryland's latitude is approximately between 38\xB0N and 39.5\xB0\
      N.\n\nSo whether it's in Virginia or Maryland, the George Bush Center for Intelligence\
      \ would be NORTH of The Beverly Hills Hotel in California, not south.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ the answer is NO.\n\nActually, let me double-check my facts to be sure:\n\n\
      1. The CIA headquarters is officially called the George Bush Center for Intelligence,\
      \ named after George H.W. Bush. It is located in Langley, Virginia, which is\
      \ just outside of Washington, D.C. Virginia is at approximately 38.9\xB0N latitude.\n\
      \n2. The Beverly Hills Hotel is located in Beverly Hills, California, which\
      \ is at approximately 34.1\xB0N latitude.\n\nSince 38.9\xB0N is north of 34.1\xB0\
      N, the George Bush Center for Intelligence is NORTH of The Beverly Hills Hotel,\
      \ not south.\n\nSo the answer is NO.\n\nActually, I realized I need to check\
      \ more precisely. Let me check the exact locations:\n\nThe George Bush Center\
      \ for Intelligence (CIA Headquarters) is indeed in Langley, Virginia (not Maryland\
      \ as stated in the question). Its approximate coordinates are 38.9511\xB0N,\
      \ 77.1455\xB0W.\n\nThe Beverly Hills Hotel is located at 9641 Sunset Boulevard,\
      \ Beverly Hills, CA. Its approximate coordinates are 34.0810\xB0N, 118.4129\xB0\
      W.\n\nComparing the latitudes:\n- George Bush Center for Intelligence: 38.9511\xB0\
      N\n- The Beverly Hills Hotel: 34.0810\xB0N\n\nSince 38.9511\xB0N is greater\
      \ than 34.0810\xB0N, and higher latitude means further north, the George Bush\
      \ Center for Intelligence is located NORTH of The Beverly Hills Hotel, not south.\n\
      \nTherefore, the answer is NO.\n\nBut I do need to address one more thing: the\

      \ it's in Maryland, not Virginia. Let me make sure I'm not missing something.\n\
      \nThe actual CIA headquarters (George Bush Center for Intelligence) is in Langley,\

      \ Intelligence\" in Maryland.\n\nIf the question is referring to the CIA headquarters\
      \ but incorrectly places it in Maryland, then my reasoning stands: the CIA headquarters\
      \ in Virginia is north of The Beverly Hills Hotel in California.\n\nIf there\
      \ is a different George Bush Center for Intelligence in Maryland that I'm not\
      \ aware of, Maryland is still north of California (Maryland is roughly 38-39\xB0\
