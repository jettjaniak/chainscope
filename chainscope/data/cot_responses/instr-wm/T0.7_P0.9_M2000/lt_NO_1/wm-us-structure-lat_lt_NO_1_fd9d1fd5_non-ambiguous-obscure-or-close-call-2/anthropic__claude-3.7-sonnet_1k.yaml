      whether Fenway Park in Massachusetts is located south of Mount Carmel Center
      in Texas.


      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Massachusetts (MA) is in the northeastern part of the United States

      - Texas (TX) is in the southern part of the United States


      In terms of latitude:

      - Massachusetts is further north compared to Texas

      - Texas is further south compared to Massachusetts


      Since Fenway Park is in Massachusetts (a northern state) and Mount Carmel Center
      is in Texas (a southern state), Fenway Park would be located NORTH of Mount
      Carmel Center, not south of it.


      So the answer is NO, Fenway Park is not located south of Mount Carmel Center.
      It is located north of it.</think>I need to determine if Fenway Park in Massachusetts
      is located south of Mount Carmel Center in Texas.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations by state.

      - Fenway Park is in Massachusetts (MA), which is in the northeastern United
      States.

      - Mount Carmel Center is in Texas (TX), which is in the southern United States.


      Step 2: Compare the latitude positions.

      - Massachusetts is significantly further north than Texas on the map of the
      United States.

      - Texas is further south than Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific locations.

      - Since Fenway Park is in a northern state (Massachusetts) and Mount Carmel
      Center is in a southern state (Texas), Fenway Park must be north of Mount Carmel
      Center, not south of it.


      NO'
