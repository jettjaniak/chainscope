      - Liberty Island is south of Manhattan''s southern tip


      3. Comparing their locations:

      - Father Duffy Square is in central Manhattan

      - The Statue of Liberty is south of Manhattan''s southern tip

      - This means Father Duffy Square is NORTH of the Statue of Liberty


      4. The question asks: Is Father Duffy Square south of the Statue of Liberty?

      - Based on our reasoning, the answer is NO


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      1. First, I''ll locate the Empire State Building in Manhattan

      - The Empire State Building is located at 350 5th Avenue

      - This is in Midtown Manhattan, which is in the central/northern part of Manhattan


      2. Next, I''ll locate the Brooklyn Bridge Pedestrian and Bike Path

      - The Brooklyn Bridge connects Manhattan and Brooklyn

      - Its Manhattan entrance is in Lower Manhattan, which is in the southern part
      of Manhattan


      3. Comparing their locations:

      - Empire State Building is in Midtown (north)

      - Brooklyn Bridge Ped and Bike path is in Lower Manhattan (south)


      4. So the Empire State Building is NORTH of the Brooklyn Bridge Ped and Bike
      path


      5. The question asks: "Is Empire State Building located SOUTH of Brooklyn Bridge
      Ped and Bike?"


      6. Since the Empire State Building is NORTH, not south, of the Brooklyn Bridge
      path...


      The answer is: NO'

      1. First, locate Lincoln Center David Geffen Hall:

      - It is located on Columbus Circle at 65th Street in Manhattan''s Upper West
      Side


      2. Next, locate Trump International Hotel:

      - It is also located at Columbus Circle, at 1 Central Park West, at the southwest
      corner of Central Park


      3. Compare their vertical positions on a map:

      - Both are at the same general area (Columbus Circle)

      - Lincoln Center David Geffen Hall is at 65th Street

      - Trump International Hotel is also at 65th Street


      4. Determine their relative north/south positioning:

      - They are essentially at the same latitude (same street)

      - Neither is south of the other


      5. Therefore, Lincoln Center David Geffen Hall is NOT south of Trump International
      Hotel.
