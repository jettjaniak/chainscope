      - Pierre Trudeau was born in 1919

      - Saint Patrick was born around 385 AD

      - 385 AD is much earlier than 1919


      4. Therefore, Saint Patrick was born BEFORE Pierre Trudeau.


      So the answer is: NO, Pierre Trudeau was NOT born earlier than Saint Patrick.'

      3. Since 1732 is earlier than 1809, George Washington was born before Charles
      Darwin.

      4. Therefore, Charles Darwin was NOT born earlier than George Washington.
