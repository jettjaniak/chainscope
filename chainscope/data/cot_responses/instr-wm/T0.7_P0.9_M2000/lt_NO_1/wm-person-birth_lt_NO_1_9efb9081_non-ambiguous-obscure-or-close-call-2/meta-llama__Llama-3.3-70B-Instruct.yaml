    b9b7a0f9-f1ce-4db2-bc38-21db27577167: 'To answer this question, let''s first establish
      the birth dates of Larry King and Saint Valentine.


      1. **Larry King''s Birth Date**: Larry King was born on November 19, 1933.


      2. **Saint Valentine''s Birth Date**: The birth date of Saint Valentine is not
      certain and can be confusing because there are at least two different saints
      known as Valentine or Valentinus, and their feast days are on February 14. However,
      the historical records of their births are not precise. Traditionally, Saint
      Valentine is believed to have lived in the 3rd century AD, during the Roman
      Empire. For the purpose of this comparison, we can consider that Saint Valentine,
      whichever one is being referred to, lived more than 1,700 years ago.


      Given these dates:


      - Larry King was born in 1933 AD.

      - Saint Valentine lived more than 1,700 years ago, which places his birth sometime
      before 300 AD, at the latest.


      Considering these timeframes, it''s clear that Saint Valentine was born before
      Larry King.


      So, the question of whether Larry King was born earlier than Saint Valentine
      can be answered as follows:


      NO'

      1. **Identify Larry King''s birth date**: Larry King was born on November 19,

      2. **Identify Saint Valentine''s birth date**: The birth date of Saint Valentine
      is not known with certainty, as there are multiple figures associated with the
      name and the exact historical records are unclear. However, it is generally
      agreed that Saint Valentine, or at least one of the most recognized ones, lived
      in the 3rd century AD. The exact dates of birth and death for the Saint Valentine
      associated with Valentine''s Day (February 14th) are not precisely known, but
      it is believed he was martyred and died on February 14th, possibly in the year
      269 AD or 270 AD.


      3. **Compare the birth dates**: Given that Saint Valentine lived in the 3rd
      century AD, his birth would have been sometime in the late 2nd or early 3rd
      century AD, making it significantly earlier than Larry King''s birth in 1933.

      Valentine is not certain due to the existence of multiple historical figures

      with Valentine''s Day, is believed to have lived in the 3rd century AD. The
      exact dates of his birth and death are not known, but it''s estimated he was
      martyred and died on February 14, around 269-270 AD. For the sake of comparison,
      let''s assume he was born sometime in the mid to late 3rd century, roughly around
      250 AD or a bit earlier.

      earlier than Piotr I (also known as Peter the Great), we need to establish the
      birth dates of both historical figures.


      1. **William Wallace**: He was a Scottish knight and freedom fighter, known
      for leading a resistance against English rule during the late 13th century.
      The exact date of his birth is not known with certainty, but it is believed
      to be around 1270-1276.


      2. **Piotr I (Peter the Great)**: He was the Emperor of Russia, ruling from
      1682 until his death in 1725. Peter the Great was born on June 9, 1672.


      Given these dates:

      - William Wallace''s birth is estimated to be between 1270 and 1276.

      - Peter the Great was born in 1672.


      Since 1270-1276 is earlier than 1672, we can conclude that William Wallace was
      indeed born earlier than Piotr I (Peter the Great).

      1. **Idi Amin''s Birth Date**: Idi Amin was born around 1925 (the exact date
      is not certain, but it''s generally believed to be between 1923 and 1928). For
      the purpose of comparison, we''ll use 1925 as his birth year.


      2. **Coco Chanel''s Birth Date**: Coco Chanel was born on August 19, 1883.


      Now, comparing the two:


      - Idi Amin was born around 1925.

      - Coco Chanel was born in 1883.


      Since 1883 is earlier than 1925, Coco Chanel was born earlier than Idi Amin.


      Given this information, the answer to whether Idi Amin was born earlier than
      Coco Chanel is: **NO**.'

      - 1960 (Senna''s birth year) is greater than 1879 (Einstein''s birth year),

      - Even though Senna''s birth month and day (March 21) are close to Einstein''s
