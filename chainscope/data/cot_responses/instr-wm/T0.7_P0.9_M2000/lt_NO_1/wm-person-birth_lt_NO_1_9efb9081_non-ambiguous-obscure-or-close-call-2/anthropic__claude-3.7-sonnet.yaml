      Step 1: Identify when Theodore Roosevelt was born.

      Theodore Roosevelt was born on October 27, 1858.


      Step 2: Identify when Thomas Alva Edison was born.

      Thomas Alva Edison was born on February 11, 1847.


      Step 3: Compare the birth years.

      Edison was born in 1847, while Roosevelt was born in 1858.

      1847 comes before 1858.


      Step 4: Determine who was born earlier.

      Since Edison''s birth year (1847) is earlier than Roosevelt''s birth year (1858),
      Edison was born earlier than Roosevelt.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO (Theodore Roosevelt was not born earlier than Thomas
      Alva Edison)'

      William Wallace was a Scottish knight who became a leader during the First War
      of Scottish Independence. He was born around 1270 (some sources suggest between
      1270-1276).


      Step 2: Identify when Piotr I (Peter the Great) was born.

      Peter the Great was a Russian Tsar who ruled the Tsardom of Russia and later
      the Russian Empire. He was born on June 9, 1672.


      Step 3: Compare the two birth dates.

      William Wallace (born circa 1270) was born approximately 400 years before Peter
      the Great (born 1672).


      Since 1270 comes before 1672 chronologically, William Wallace was born earlier
      than Peter the Great.

      Step 1: Let me identify when Charles Darwin was born.

      Charles Darwin was born on February 12, 1809.


      Step 2: Let me identify when George Washington was born.

      George Washington was born on February 22, 1732.


      Step 3: Let me compare these dates.

      1732 is earlier than 1809.

      Therefore, George Washington was born before Charles Darwin.


      Step 4: The question asks if Darwin was born earlier than Washington.

      Since Washington (1732) was born before Darwin (1809), Darwin was NOT born earlier
      than Washington.

      Step 2: Let me identify when Jane Austen was born.

      Jane Austen was born on December 16, 1775.


      Step 3: Now I need to compare these dates to determine who was born earlier.

      1775 (Jane Austen''s birth year) comes before 1899 (Duke Ellington''s birth
      year).


      Step 4: Since Jane Austen was born in 1775 and Duke Ellington was born in 1899,
      Jane Austen was born earlier than Duke Ellington, not the other way around.


      NO, Duke Ellington was not born earlier than Jane Austen. Jane Austen was born
      earlier than Duke Ellington.'

      4) 1828 is earlier than 1925. This means Tolstoy was born about 97 years before
      Kennedy.


      5) Since Tolstoy was born in 1828 and Kennedy was born in 1925, Tolstoy was
      born earlier.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO (Robert Kennedy was not born earlier than Leo Tolstoy)'

      A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was born on October 15, 1931, in India.


      Step 2: Let me identify when Benito Mussolini was born.

      Benito Mussolini was born on July 29, 1883, in Italy.


      Step 3: Compare the birth years to determine who was born earlier.

      Mussolini was born in 1883, while Kalam was born in 1931.

      1883 comes before 1931, so Mussolini was born 48 years before Kalam.


      Step 4: Answer the specific question: "Was A.P.J. Abdul Kalam born earlier than
      Benito Mussolini?"

      Since Mussolini (1883) was born before Kalam (1931), Kalam was NOT born earlier
      than Mussolini.

      who was born earlier.


      Step 1: Identify when Johan Cruyff was born.

      Johan Cruyff, the legendary Dutch footballer, was born on April 25, 1947.


      Step 2: Identify when Yasser Arafat was born.

      Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian political leader, was born on August 24, 1929.

      1929 comes before 1947, which means Yasser Arafat was born 18 years earlier
      than Johan Cruyff.


      Since Arafat (1929) was born before Cruyff (1947), Cruyff was NOT born earlier
