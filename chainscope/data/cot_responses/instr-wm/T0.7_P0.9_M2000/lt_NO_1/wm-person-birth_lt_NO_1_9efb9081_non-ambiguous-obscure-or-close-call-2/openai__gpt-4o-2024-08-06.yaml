      China, traditionally dated to around the 5th century BCE. His exact birth date
      is not known, but it is generally accepted that he lived many centuries before
      the Common Era.


      Given that Jim Morrison was born in the 20th century CE and Sun Tzu is estimated
      to have lived in the 5th century BCE, Sun Tzu was born much earlier than Jim
      Morrison.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.'
