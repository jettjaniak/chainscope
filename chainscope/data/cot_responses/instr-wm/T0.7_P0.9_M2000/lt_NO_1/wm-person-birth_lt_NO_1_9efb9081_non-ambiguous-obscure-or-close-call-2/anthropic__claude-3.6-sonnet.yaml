      - Josef Mengele was born in 1911

      - Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was born in 1840

      - Therefore, Tchaikovsky was born 71 years before Mengele


      3. The question asks if Mengele was born earlier than Tchaikovsky

      - And Mengele (1911) came later


      NO (Mengele was not born earlier than Tchaikovsky)'
