      1. Johann Sebastian Bach was a famous German composer and musician of the Baroque
      period. He was born on March 31, 1685.


      2. Alighiero di Bellincione was the father of the Italian poet Dante Alighieri.

      Now, compare the two dates:


      - Mark Twain: 1835

      - Carl Jung: 1875


      Since 1835 is earlier than 1875, Mark Twain was born before Carl Jung.


      **Answer: NO**'
