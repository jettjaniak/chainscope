      - J. P. Morgan was born in 1837.

      - James Cook was born in 1728.


      Since 1728 is earlier than 1837, James Cook was born before J. P. Morgan.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Was J. P. Morgan born earlier than James
      Cook?" is **NO**'

    e81465f2-4503-4fca-b846-9455ceec8b91: 'To answer this question, let''s first identify
      the birth years of both historical figures:


      1. **Identify the birth year of Idi Amin**: Idi Amin, the former President of
      Uganda, was born in 1925.


      2. **Identify the birth year of Coco Chanel**: Coco Chanel, the famous French
      fashion designer, was born in 1883.


      Now, we compare the birth years to determine who was born earlier:


      - Idi Amin was born in 1925.

      - Coco Chanel was born in 1883.


      Given that 1883 is earlier than 1925, Coco Chanel was born before Idi Amin.


      The answer to the question "Was Idi Amin born earlier than Coco Chanel?" is:
      **NO**'

      1. **Identify the birth year of Gustave Eiffel**: Gustave Eiffel, the French
      civil engineer and architect, was born on December 15, 1832.


      2. **Identify the birth year of Henry VIII of England**: Henry VIII of England,
