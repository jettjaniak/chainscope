    728660fd-3eac-436e-bf09-3350d3d55f85: 'Alright, let''s tackle this
      question step by step. The goal is to determine whether Boston, MA is less populous
      than Queens, NY. To do this, I need to find the population figures for both
      cities and compare them. Here''s how I''ll approach it:


      ### Step 1: Identify the Populations of Boston and Queens


      First, I need to find the current population estimates for Boston, MA, and Queens,
      NY. Since populations can change over time, it''s important to use reliable
      and up-to-date sources.


      **Boston, MA:**

      Boston is a major city in Massachusetts and is known for its rich history and
      educational institutions. To find its population, I can look at recent census
      data or estimates from reputable sources like the U.S. Census Bureau or city
      government websites.


      **Queens, NY:**

      Queens is one of the five boroughs of New York City. Its population is substantial,
      given that New York City is one of the most populous cities in the United States.
      Similarly, I''ll seek recent population data for Queens.


      ### Step 2: Source the Population Data


      I''ll start by searching for the most recent population figures for both Boston
      and Queens.


      **Finding Boston''s Population:**

      A quick search leads me to the U.S. Census Bureau''s latest population estimates.
      According to the 2020 Census and subsequent updates, Boston has a population
      of approximately 675,647 residents as of the most recent estimate.


      **Finding Queens'' Population:**

      For Queens, I''ll also refer to the U.S. Census Bureau. Queens is reported to
      have a population of about 2,405,464 residents according to the same sources.


      ### Step 3: Compare the Populations


      Now that I have both population figures:


      - **Boston, MA:** ~675,647 residents

      - **Queens, NY:** ~2,405,464 residents


      Comparing these numbers, it''s clear that Queens has a significantly larger
      population than Boston.


      ### Step 4: Conclusion


      Based on the data:


      - **Boston''s Population:** ~675,647

      - **Queens'' Population:** ~2,405,464


      Since 675,647 (Boston) is less than 2,405,464 (Queens), the answer to the question
      is:


      **YES, Boston, MA is less populous than Queens, NY.**'
