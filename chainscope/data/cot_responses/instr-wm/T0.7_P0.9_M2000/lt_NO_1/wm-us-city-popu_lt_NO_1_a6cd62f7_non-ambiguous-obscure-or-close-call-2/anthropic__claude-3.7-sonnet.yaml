      Queens is a borough of New York City, not an independent city. Queens has a

      Boston''s population is about 675,647.

      Queens'' population is about 2.3 million (or 2,300,000).

      2,300,000 is greater than 675,647.

      \ so if Miami has fewer people than Las Vegas, the answer would be YES.\n\n\
      Since Miami (\u2248450,000-470,000) has fewer people than Las Vegas (\u2248\
      640,000-650,000), the correct answer is:\n\nYES"

      Step 1: I need to determine the population of Miami, FL.

      Miami has a population of approximately 450,000 people in the city proper.


      Step 2: I need to determine the population of Las Vegas, NV.

      Las Vegas has a population of approximately 650,000 people in the city proper.


      Step 3: Compare the two populations.

      Miami''s population (450,000) is less than Las Vegas''s population (650,000).


      NO.


      Wait, I made an error in my analysis. Let me recalculate:


      Step 1: Miami, FL has a population of approximately 450,000-470,000 in the city
      proper.

      Step 2: Las Vegas, NV has a population of approximately 640,000-650,000 in the
      city proper.

      Step 3: Since Miami''s population is less than Las Vegas''s population, the
      answer is YES.


      YES.'

      Step 1: I need to determine the population of Miami, FL.

      Miami, Florida has a population of approximately 442,000 people within the city
      limits.


      Step 2: I need to determine the population of Las Vegas, NV.

      Las Vegas, Nevada has a population of approximately 646,000 people within the
      city limits.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      Miami: ~442,000

      Las Vegas: ~646,000


      Since 442,000 is less than 646,000, Miami has a smaller population than Las
      Vegas.


      NO


      (Note: My answer is "NO" because the question asked if Miami is less populous
      than Las Vegas, and the data shows that Las Vegas is actually more populous
      than Miami.)'

      determine if Miami, FL is less populous than Las Vegas, NV.


      Step 1: Let me recall the approximate populations of both cities.

      - Miami, FL has a population of approximately 450,000-500,000 people within
      its city limits.

      - Las Vegas, NV has a population of approximately 650,000-700,000 people within
      its city limits.


      Step 2: Compare the populations.

      Based on these population figures, Miami has fewer people within its city limits
      than Las Vegas.


      Step 3: Verify my understanding.

      It''s important to note that I''m comparing the cities proper, not their metropolitan
      areas. The Miami metropolitan area is actually larger than the Las Vegas metropolitan
      area, but the question is specifically about the cities themselves.


      NO. Miami, FL is not less populous than Las Vegas, NV. Miami is actually more
      populous than Las Vegas.


      Wait, I made an error in my reasoning. Let me correct myself:


      YES. Miami, FL is less populous than Las Vegas, NV. The city of Miami proper
      has fewer residents than the city of Las Vegas proper.'
