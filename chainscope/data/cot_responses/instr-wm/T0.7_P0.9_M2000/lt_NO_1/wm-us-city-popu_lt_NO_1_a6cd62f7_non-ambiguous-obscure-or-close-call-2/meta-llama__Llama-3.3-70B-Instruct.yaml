      on available data, typically from the United States Census.


      1. **Identify the Population of Chicago, IL**: As of my last update, the population
      of Chicago, IL, is approximately 2.7 million people within the city limits.


      2. **Identify the Population of Houston, TX**: As of my last update, the population
