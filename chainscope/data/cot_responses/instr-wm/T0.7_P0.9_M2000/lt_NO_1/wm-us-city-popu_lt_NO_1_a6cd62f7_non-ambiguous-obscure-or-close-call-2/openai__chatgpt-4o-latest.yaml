      Step 1: Understand that Brooklyn is a borough of New York City, not an independent

      it is so large.


      Step 2: Look at the population of San Francisco. As of the most recent data

      Brooklyn has a population of well over 2.5 million people, making it more populous
      than most U.S. cities if it were considered independently.
