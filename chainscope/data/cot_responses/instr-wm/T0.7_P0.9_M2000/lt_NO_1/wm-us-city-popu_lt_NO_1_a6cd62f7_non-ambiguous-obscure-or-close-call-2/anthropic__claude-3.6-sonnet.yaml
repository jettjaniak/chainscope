      1. First, let me recall the population of Miami, FL:

      * Miami''s population is approximately 442,000 (2020 census)


      2. Next, let me recall the population of Las Vegas, NV:

      * Las Vegas''s population is approximately 642,000 (2020 census)


      3. Compare the numbers:

      * 442,000 (Miami) < 642,000 (Las Vegas)

      * Miami has about 200,000 fewer residents than Las Vegas


      Therefore: YES, Miami is less populous than Las Vegas.'
