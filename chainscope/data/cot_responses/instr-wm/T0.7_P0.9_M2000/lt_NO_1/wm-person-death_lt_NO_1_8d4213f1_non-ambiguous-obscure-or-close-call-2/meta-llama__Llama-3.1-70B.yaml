      Frida Kahlo died on July 13, 1954.


      Now, let''s compare the dates:

      2. **Miguel de Cervantes**: Miguel de Cervantes was a Spanish writer who is
      widely regarded as the greatest writer in the Spanish language. He died on April
      23, 1616.


      Now, comparing the dates:


      - Malcolm X died on February 21, 1965.

      - Miguel de Cervantes died on April 23, 1616.


      Given that 1616 is earlier than 1965, Miguel de Cervantes died at an earlier
      date than Malcolm X.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Did Malcolm X die at an earlier date
      than Miguel de Cervantes?" is:


      NO'
