      of President John F. Kennedy, was shot and killed by night club owner Jack Ruby

      - Amelia Earhart is presumed to have died around July 2, 1937, with her death

    91c29ca6-bbe8-4b18-be19-e07e5709df7a: 'To answer this question,

      1. **Nelson Mandela''s Death Date**: Nelson Mandela, the former President of
      South Africa and anti-apartheid activist, passed away on December 5, 2013.


      2. **Josef Mengele''s Death Date**: Josef Mengele, the German Schutzstaffel

      1. **Steve Jobs**: He was the co-founder of Apple Inc. and passed away on October

      2. **Richard I**: Also known as Richard the Lionheart, he was King of England
      from 1189 to 1199. He died on April 6, 1199.


      Now, comparing the death dates:


      - Steve Jobs died on October 5, 2011.

      - Richard I died on April 6, 1199.


      Since 1199 is significantly earlier than 2011, Richard I died at an earlier

      of England and then compare them.


      1. **Jesse Owens'' Date of Death**: Jesse Owens was an American track and field
      athlete and four-time Olympic gold medalist. He was born on September 12, 1913,
      and died on March 31, 1980.

      novelist, and according to historical records, he died on June 9, 1870.


      3. **Compare the death dates**: Now, we compare the two dates to see who died
      earlier. January 14, 1957, is significantly later than June 9, 1870.


      Given the information, since Charles Dickens died in 1870 and Humphrey Bogart
      died in 1957, it is clear that Charles Dickens died at an earlier date than
      Humphrey Bogart.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Did Humphrey Bogart die at an earlier
      date than Charles Dickens?" is: **NO**.'

      1. Johann Sebastian Bach was a German composer who lived from 1685 to 1750.

      2. William Wallace was a Scottish knight who led the resistance against English
      rule in Scotland, and he lived from around 1270 to 1305.


      Now, comparing their death dates:

      - Johann Sebastian Bach died in 1750.
