      space, died on March 27, 1968.


      2. Tupac Shakur, the American rapper and actor, died on September 13, 1996.


      Now, comparing the two dates:


      - Yuri Gagarin died in 1968.

      - Tupac Shakur died in 1996.


      Since 1968 is earlier than 1996, Tupac Shakur did not die at an earlier date

      the dates of death for both historical figures:


      1. **Andy Warhol**: He was an American artist and a leading figure in the visual
      art movement known as pop art. Andy Warhol died on February 22, 1987.


      2. **Marco Polo**: He was a Venetian merchant, explorer, and writer who traveled
      through Asia along the Silk Road. Marco Polo died on January 8, 1324.


      Now, comparing these dates:


      - Marco Polo died in 1324.

      - Andy Warhol died in 1987.


      Since 1324 is earlier than 1987, Andy Warhol did not die at an earlier date

      an earlier date than Marco Polo, let''s consider the timeline of their deaths:


      1. Marco Polo was a Venetian merchant traveler who lived during the 13th and

      2. Andy Warhol was an American artist and a leading figure in the visual art
