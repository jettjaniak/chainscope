    f45943a8-30d1-46da-8951-d6dadaa6672b: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me recall when Richard Nixon died

      - Nixon died on April 22, 1994


      2. Now, let me recall when Luciano Pavarotti died

      - Pavarotti died on September 6, 2007


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - 1994 comes before 2007

      - Therefore, Nixon died first, and Pavarotti died later


      4. The question asks if Pavarotti died earlier than Nixon

      - Since Pavarotti died in 2007, which is later than Nixon''s death in 1994

      - This means Pavarotti did NOT die earlier than Nixon
