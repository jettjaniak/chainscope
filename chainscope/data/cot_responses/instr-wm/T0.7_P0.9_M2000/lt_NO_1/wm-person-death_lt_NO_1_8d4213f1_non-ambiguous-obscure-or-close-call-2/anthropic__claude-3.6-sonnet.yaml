      2. Next, let me check Jimmy Carter''s dates

      - Jimmy Carter was born on October 1, 1924

      - Jimmy Carter died on February 11, 2024


      3. Now I can compare:

      - Catherine II died in 1796

      - Jimmy Carter died in 2024

      - 1796 comes before 2024


      Therefore, since Catherine II died in 1796 and Jimmy Carter died in 2024, Catherine
      II died at an earlier date.


      NO (Jimmy Carter did not die at an earlier date than Catherine II)'

      2. Now, let me recall when Genghis Khan died:

      - Genghis Khan died on August 18, 1227


      3. Now I can compare these dates:

      - 1227 (Genghis Khan''s death) comes before 1431 (Joan of Arc''s death)

      - Therefore, Genghis Khan died about 204 years before Joan of Arc


      4. The question asks if Joan died earlier than Genghis Khan

      - Since Joan died later, not earlier, than Genghis Khan...

      - Since Pavarotti died in 2007 and Nixon in 1994

      - Pavarotti died later, not earlier


      NO'
