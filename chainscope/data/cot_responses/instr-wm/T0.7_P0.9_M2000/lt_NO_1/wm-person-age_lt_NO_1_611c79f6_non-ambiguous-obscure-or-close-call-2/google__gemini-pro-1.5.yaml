      3. **Find Sitting Bull''s date of birth and death:**  Sitting Bull''s birth
      year is uncertain, estimated to be between 1831 and 1837. He died December 15,
      1890.


      4. **Calculate Sitting Bull''s approximate age at death:**  Since the latest
      possible birth year for Sitting Bull is 1837, and he died in 1890, his maximum
      age at death would have been 1890 - 1837 = 53.  Even if he were born in 1831
      (the earliest estimate), he would have been 59 in 1890.



      5. **Compare:** Lewis Carroll was at least 65 when he died. Sitting Bull was
      at most 59 when he died.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.

      date of birth and death:**  Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, known by his pen name
      Lewis Carroll, was born January 27, 1832, and died January 14, 1898.


      2. **Calculate Lewis Carroll''s age at death:** 1898 - 1832 = 65 years old (almost
      66).


      3. **Find Sitting Bull''s date of birth and death (approximate is acceptable):**  Sitting
      Bull''s birth year is uncertain, estimated to be between 1831 and 1837. He died

      4. **Calculate Sitting Bull''s approximate age at death:**  Using the latest
      possible birth year of 1837, his age at death would have been 1890 - 1837 =
      53 years old.  Even if he were born in 1831, he would have been 59 in 1890.

      he lived past his early 40s in that era.

      their ages if we had birth dates, but the question only asks for a comparison.

      5.  We need to determine if Jules Verne was younger when he died than Virginia
      Woolf was when she died.


      Jules Verne died in 1905. Virginia Woolf died in 1941.  Therefore, Jules Verne
      must have been dead by the time Virginia Woolf died.  This means he couldn''t
      have been *older* than her at his death, only younger or the same age.  Since
      it is highly unlikely they died at the exact same age, he was almost certainly
      younger.
