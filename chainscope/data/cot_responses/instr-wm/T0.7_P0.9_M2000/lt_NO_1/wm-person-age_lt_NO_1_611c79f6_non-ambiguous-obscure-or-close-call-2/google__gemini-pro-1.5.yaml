      2. **Calculate Lewis Carroll''s age at death:** 1898 - 1832 = 65 years old (almost
      66).


      3. **Find Sitting Bull''s date of birth and death (approximate is acceptable):**  Sitting
      Bull''s birth year is uncertain, estimated to be between 1831 and 1837. He died
      December 15, 1890.


      4. **Calculate Sitting Bull''s approximate age at death:**  Using the latest
      possible birth year of 1837, his age at death would have been 1890 - 1837 =
      53 years old.  Even if he were born in 1831, he would have been 59 in 1890.


      5. **Compare their ages at death:** Lewis Carroll was older than Sitting Bull
      at the time of their respective deaths.

    000838da-6ca6-49af-952a-624f973138d7: '1. **Find Alighiero di Bellincione''s death
      date:**  Alighiero di Bellincione, Dante''s father, died around 1283.


      2. **Find Osama bin Laden''s death date:** Osama bin Laden died in 2011.


      3. **Determine Alighiero''s approximate age at death:**  This is difficult to
      pinpoint, but records suggest he was likely born between 1220 and 1230.  This
      means he was likely somewhere between 53 and 63 when he died.


      4. **Determine Osama bin Laden''s age at death:** Osama bin Laden was born in
      1957, making him 54 when he died.


      5. **Compare their ages at death:** Alighiero was likely between 53-63, and
      Osama was 54.  Therefore, Alighiero *could have been* younger, the same age,
      or older.


      Therefore, we cannot definitively say yes or no.  However, if we had to choose,
      the *most likely* answer is NO.

      3. **Determine Alighiero''s approximate age at death:** We don''t have a precise

      older than their children, so Alighiero must have been at least in his late

      their children, so Alighiero must have been born *before* 1265. Let''s assume,
      for the sake of argument and being generous, that he was only 18 when Dante
      was born, making his birth year around 1247.  This means he likely died around
      age 36 (1283-1247=36).  Even if he were older when Dante was born, it''s unlikely
      he lived past his early 40s in that era.

      5.  We need to determine if Jules Verne was younger when he died than Virginia
      Woolf was when she died.


      Jules Verne died in 1905. Virginia Woolf died in 1941.  Therefore, Jules Verne
      must have been dead by the time Virginia Woolf died.  This means he couldn''t
      have been *older* than her at his death, only younger or the same age.  Since
      it is highly unlikely they died at the exact same age, he was almost certainly
      younger.

      3. **Determine who died earlier:** Bruce Lee died earlier than Leonard Nimoy.

      4. **Consider the question:**  The question asks if Nimoy was *younger* at the
      time of his death than Lee was at his.  Since Nimoy died later, he would have
      to have been significantly younger than Lee to be younger at death.

      5. **Conclusion:**  It''s extremely unlikely Nimoy was *that* much younger than
      Lee.
