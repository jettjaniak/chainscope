      **Step 2: Determine the birth and death years of Jane Austen.**

      - Jane Austen was born in 1775.

      - She died in 1817.

      - So, her age at death = 1817 - 1775 = **42 years old**.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**

      - Karl Marx: 65 years old.

      - Jane Austen: 42 years old.


      **Step 4: Determine whether Karl Marx was younger than Jane Austen at the time
      of death.**

      - 65 (Marx) is greater than 42 (Austen), so **Karl Marx was older**, not younger.

      step.


      Step 1: Establish the birth and death dates of Elizabeth I of England.

      - Elizabeth I was born in 1533.

      - She died in 1603.

      - That would make her 1603 - 1533 = 70 years old at the time of her death.


      Step 2: Establish the birth and death dates of William Wallace.

      - William Wallace was born around 1270 (the exact year is uncertain, but 1270
      is a commonly accepted estimate).

      - He died in 1305.

      - That would make him approximately 1305 - 1270 = 35 years old at the time of
      his death.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Elizabeth I: 70 years old.

      - William Wallace: approximately 35 years old.

      Elizabeth I was older at the time of her death than William Wallace.

      Step 1: Determine the age at death of Elizabeth I of England.

      - Elizabeth I was born on September 7, 1533.

      - She died on March 24, 1603.

      - So, she lived from 1533 to 1603, which is 69 years.

      - Since her birthday in 1603 had not yet occurred when she died in March, she
      was 69 (not yet 70).


      Step 2: Determine the age at death of William Wallace.

      - William Wallace was born around 1270. The exact date is not certain, but 1270
      is commonly accepted.

      - He died on August 23, 1305.

      - So, from 1270 to 1305 is 35 years.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Elizabeth I died at age 69.

      Answer: NO'
    796ae914-d5bb-42b1-b723-b11059f6ea70: 'To answer whether Benito Mussolini was
      younger at the time of his death than Freddie Mercury, let''s go step by step:


      **Step 1: Find Benito Mussolini''s birth and death dates.**

      - Mussolini was born on July 29, 1883.

      - He died on April 28, 1945.


      So, Mussolini died before his birthday in 1945.


      Calculate his age at death:

      - From July 29, 1883, to July 29, 1944 = 61 years.

      - He died in April 1945, so he had not reached his 62nd birthday yet.

      - Therefore, Mussolini was 61 years old when he died.


      **Step 2: Find Freddie Mercury''s birth and death dates.**

      - Freddie Mercury was born on September 5, 1946.

      - He died on November 24, 1991.


      Calculate his age at death:

      - From September 5, 1946, to September 5, 1991 = 45 years.

      - He died in November 1991, so he had just turned 45 a couple of months earlier.

      - Therefore, Freddie Mercury was 45 years old when he died.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**

      - Mussolini: 61 years old.

      - Freddie Mercury: 45 years old.


      **Conclusion:**

      Mussolini was older than Freddie Mercury at the time of his death.

      **Step 2: Determine Ho Chi Minh''s age at death.**

      - Ho Chi Minh was born on May 19, 1890.

      - He died on September 2, 1969.

      - From 1890 to 1969 is 79 years.

      - Since he died after his birthday in 1969, he was 79 years old when he died.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**

      - Rosa Parks died at 92.

      - Ho Chi Minh died at 79.


      So, Rosa Parks was older than Ho Chi Minh at the time of their respective deaths.


      **Final Answer: NO**.'

      at the time of her death than Ho Chi Minh was at his time of death, we need
      to:


      1. Find the birth and death dates of both individuals.

      2. Calculate their ages at death.

      3. Compare the two ages.


      **Step 1: Rosa Parks**

      - Born: February 4, 1913

      - Died: October 24, 2005


      To calculate her age at death:

      - From February 4, 1913, to February 4, 2005 = 92 years

      - She died in October 2005, so she was still 92 years old at the time of her
      death.


      **Step 2: Ho Chi Minh**

      - Born: May 19, 1890

      - Died: September 2, 1969


      To calculate his age at death:

      - From May 19, 1890, to May 19, 1969 = 79 years

      - He died in September 1969, so he was still 79 years old at the time of his
      death.


      **Step 3: Compare the ages**

      - Rosa Parks: 92 years old

      - Ho Chi Minh: 79 years old


      So, Rosa Parks was older at the time of her death than Ho Chi Minh.

      **Step 1: Determine Woodrow Wilson''s age at the time of death.**


      - Woodrow Wilson was born on December 28, 1856.

      - He died on February 3, 1924.


      To calculate his age at death:


      - From December 28, 1856, to December 28, 1923, is exactly 67 years.

      - He died a little over a month later, on February 3, 1924.


      So, Woodrow Wilson was 67 years old when he died.


      **Step 2: Determine John the Baptist''s age at the time of death.**


      John the Baptist is a biblical figure, and we do not have exact birth and death
      dates for him. However, historical and traditional estimates can be used:


      - It is generally believed that John the Baptist was born around the same time
      as Jesus, possibly just a few months earlier.

      - Jesus is believed to have been crucified around age 33.

      - John the Baptist was executed before Jesus, during the ministry of Jesus.


      Assuming John the Baptist was about the same age as Jesus or slightly older,
      and that he died during Jesus'' early ministry, it''s commonly estimated that
      John the Baptist died at around age 30-31.


      **Step 3: Compare the ages.**


      - Woodrow Wilson: 67 years old at death.

      - John the Baptist: Approximately 30-31 years old at death.


      **Conclusion:**


      Woodrow Wilson was older at the time of death than John the Baptist.

    a1987425-0944-4027-8aee-146a69e7f86a: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the age at death of both Harry S. Truman and Antonio Vivaldi, and then compare
      those ages.


      Step 1: Determine Harry S. Truman''s age at death.

      - Harry S. Truman was born on May 8, 1884.

      - He died on December 26, 1972.

      - So, from May 8, 1884 to May 8, 1972 is 88 years.

      - From May 8 to December 26 is an additional 7 months and 18 days.

      - Therefore, Truman was 88 years old when he died.


      Step 2: Determine Antonio Vivaldi''s age at death.

      - Antonio Vivaldi was born on March 4, 1678.

      - He died on July 28, 1741.

      - From March 4, 1678 to March 4, 1741 is 63 years.

      - From March 4 to July 28 is an additional 4 months and 24 days.

      - So, Vivaldi was 63 years old when he died.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Truman: 88 years old.

      - Vivaldi: 63 years old.


      Since 88 is greater than 63, Truman was older at the time of his death than
      Vivaldi.

      Step 1: Determine the age at death of Abraham Lincoln.

      - Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809.

      - He died on April 15, 1865.

      - So, from 1809 to 1865 is 56 years.

      - Since he died after his birthday in 1865, he was 56 years old when he died.


      Step 2: Determine the age at death of James Cook.

      - James Cook was born on November 7, 1728.

      - He died on February 14, 1779.

      - From 1728 to 1779 is 51 years.

      - Since he died before his birthday in 1779, he was still 50 years old at the
      time of death.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Abraham Lincoln: 56 years old.

      - James Cook: 50 years old.


      So, Lincoln was older at the time of his death than James Cook.

      younger at the time of his death than James Cook, we need to:


      1. Find the birth and death dates of Abraham Lincoln.

      2. Calculate Lincoln''s age at death.

      3. Find the birth and death dates of James Cook.

      4. Calculate Cook''s age at death.

      5. Compare the two ages.


      Step 1: Abraham Lincoln''s birth and death dates

      - Born: February 12, 1809

      - Died: April 15, 1865


      Step 2: Calculate Lincoln''s age at death

      From February 12, 1809 to February 12, 1865 is 56 years.

      From February 12 to April 15 is 2 months and 3 days.

      So, Lincoln was 56 years and about 2 months old when he died.


      Step 3: James Cook''s birth and death dates

      - Born: November 7, 1728

      - Died: February 14, 1779


      Step 4: Calculate Cook''s age at death

      From November 7, 1728 to November 7, 1778 is 50 years.

      From November 7, 1778 to February 14, 1779 is 3 months and 7 days.

      So, Cook was 50 years and about 3 months old when he died.


      Step 5: Compare the two ages

      - Abraham Lincoln: ~56 years and 2 months

      - James Cook: ~50 years and 3 months


      Since 56 is greater than 50, Lincoln was older than Cook at the time of death.

      **Step 1: Determine the age at death of Johannes Gutenberg.**


      - Johannes Gutenberg was born around the year 1400 (the exact year is uncertain,
      but often cited as circa 1400).

      - He died in 1468.

      - So, if he was born in 1400 and died in 1468, he would have been approximately
      68 years old at the time of his death.


      **Step 2: Determine the age at death of Steve Jobs.**


      - Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955.

      - He died on October 5, 2011.

      - From 1955 to 2011 is 56 years. Since he was born in February and died in October,
      he had already turned 56 that year.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**


      - Johannes Gutenberg: about 68 years old.

      - Steve Jobs: 56 years old.


      **Conclusion:**


      Gutenberg was older than Steve Jobs at the time of death.

      **Step 1: Determine the age at death of Johannes Gutenberg.**


      - Johannes Gutenberg is believed to have been born around the year 1400.

      - He died in 1468.


      So, if he was born in 1400 and died in 1468, that would make him approximately:

      1468 - 1400 = **68 years old** at the time of death.


      (Note: his exact birth year is uncertain, but most sources estimate around 1400.)

      the ages at death of both Leonardo da Vinci and Judy Garland, and then compare
      them.


      **Step 1: Find Leonardo da Vinci''s age at death.**


      - Leonardo da Vinci was born on April 15, 1452.

      - He died on May 2, 1519.


      To calculate his age at death:


      - From April 15, 1452, to April 15, 1519, is 67 years.

      - He died on May 2, 1519, so he lived an additional 17 days after his 67th birthday.


      So, Leonardo da Vinci was 67 years old at the time of his death.


      **Step 2: Find Judy Garland''s age at death.**


      - Judy Garland was born on June 10, 1922.

      - She died on June 22, 1969.


      To calculate her age at death:


      - From June 10, 1922, to June 10, 1969, is 47 years.

      - She died on June 22, 1969, so she lived 12 days after her 47th birthday.


      So, Judy Garland was 47 years old at the time of her death.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**


      - Leonardo da Vinci: 67 years old

      - Judy Garland: 47 years old


      Since 67 > 47, Leonardo da Vinci was older at the time of his death than Judy
      Garland.

      - Born: August 19, 1883

      - Died: January 10, 1971


      **Step 2: Coco Chanel''s age at death**

      - From 1883 to 1971 is 88 years.

      - So she was 87 years old when she died.


      **Step 3: John Lewis''s birth and death years**

      - Born: February 21, 1940

      - Died: July 17, 2020


      **Step 4: John Lewis''s age at death**

      - From 1940 to 2020 is 80 years.

      - He died after his birthday in 2020, so he was 80 years old at death.


      **Step 5: Compare the ages**

      - Coco Chanel: 87 years old

      - John Lewis: 80 years old


      87 > 80, so Coco Chanel was older than John Lewis at their respective times

      - He died on November 30, 2018.


      To calculate his age at death:


      - From June 12, 1924, to June 12, 2018 = 94 years.

      - He died in November 2018, which is after his birthday in June, so he was 94
      years old when he died.


      **Step 2: Determine the birth and death years of Abu Bakr.**


      - Abu Bakr was born in 573 CE.

      - He died in 634 CE.


      To calculate his age at death:


      - 634 - 573 = 61 years old at the time of death.

      - From 1735 to 1826 is 91 years.

      - But since he died before his birthday in 1826 (October 30), he had not yet
      turned 91.

      - So he was 90 years old when he died.


      **Step 2: Find the birth and death dates of Alfred Nobel.**

      - Alfred Nobel was born on October 21, 1833.

      - He died on December 10, 1896.


      So, he lived from 1833 to 1896.


      Now calculate his age at death:

      - From 1833 to 1896 is 63 years.

      - Since he died after his birthday in 1896 (October 21), he had already turned
      63.

      - So he was 63 years old when he died.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**

      - John Adams was 90 years old.

      - Alfred Nobel was 63 years old.


      So, John Adams was older than Alfred Nobel at their respective times of death.

      at the time of his death than Joseph Goebbels, we need to find both of their
      birth and death dates and then calculate their ages at death.


      **Step 1: J. P. Morgan**


      - Born: April 17, 1837

      - Died: March 31, 1913


      Now calculate his age at the time of death:


      - From April 17, 1837, to April 17, 1912 = 75 years

      - From April 17, 1912, to March 31, 1913 = almost 1 more year, but not quite


      So J. P. Morgan died just shy of his 76th birthday. Therefore, he was 75 years
      old when he died.


      **Step 2: Joseph Goebbels**


      - Born: October 29, 1897

      - Died: May 1, 1945


      Now calculate his age at the time of death:


      - From October 29, 1897, to October 29, 1944 = 47 years

      - From October 29, 1944, to May 1, 1945 = a little over 6 months


      So Joseph Goebbels was 47 years old when he died.


      **Step 3: Compare Ages**


      - J. P. Morgan: 75 years old

      - Joseph Goebbels: 47 years old


      So J. P. Morgan was older at the time of his death than Joseph Goebbels.
