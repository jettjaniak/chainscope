      2. **Grigori Rasputin''s Age at Death**: Grigori Rasputin was born on January
      22, 1869, and died on December 30, 1916. Therefore, he was 47 years old at the

      Now, we can compare their ages at the time of death: Franklin Delano Roosevelt
      was 63 years old, and Grigori Rasputin was 47 years old.


      Since 63 is greater than 47, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was indeed older at the

      1. **Henry Ford''s age at death**: Henry Ford was born on July 30, 1863, and
      died on April 7, 1947. Therefore, he was 83 years old when he died.

      2. **Jesse Owens'' age at death**: Jesse Owens was born on September 12, 1913,

      Now, let''s compare their ages at the time of their deaths. Henry Ford was 83
      years old, and Jesse Owens was 66 years old.


      Since 83 is greater than 66, Henry Ford was indeed older at the time of his

      we need to find out the ages of Indira Gandhi and Friedrich Nietzsche at the
      time of their deaths.


      1. **Indira Gandhi''s Age at Death**: Indira Gandhi was born on November 19,
      1917, and died on October 31, 1984. So, she was 66 years old at the time of
      her death.


      2. **Friedrich Nietzsche''s Age at Death**: Friedrich Nietzsche was born on
      October 15, 1844, and died on August 25, 1900. So, he was 55 years old at the
      time of his death.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death, we can see that Indira Gandhi
      was 66 years old, and Friedrich Nietzsche was 55 years old.


      Since 66 is greater than 55, Indira Gandhi was older at the time of her death
      than Friedrich Nietzsche was at the time of his death. However, the question
      asks if Indira Gandhi was younger at the time of her death than Friedrich Nietzsche

      of his death.


      2. **Steve Jobs'' Age at Death**: Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955,

      2. **Find the age of Saddam Hussein at the time of death**: Saddam Hussein was
      born on April 28, 1937, and died on December 30, 2006. Therefore, he was 69
      years old when he died.

      Hussein at the time of their deaths. Thomas Jefferson was 83 years old, and
      Saddam Hussein was 69 years old.


      Given that 83 is greater than 69, Thomas Jefferson was older at the time of

      - Agatha Christie was 85 years old when she died.

      - Richard I was 41 years old when he died.


      Since 85 is greater than 41, Agatha Christie was indeed older than Richard I

      we need to compare the ages of Vasco da Gama and Che Guevara at the time of
      their deaths.


      1. Vasco da Gama was born on either 1460 or 1469 (sources vary), and he died
      on December 24, 1524.

      2. Che Guevara was born on June 14, 1928, and died on October 9, 1967.


      To determine the ages of both individuals at the time of their deaths, we subtract
      their birth years from their death years:


      - Vasco da Gama''s age at death: 1524 - 1460 = 64 years (if born in 1460) or
      1524 - 1469 = 55 years (if born in 1469)

      - Che Guevara''s age at death: 1967 - 1928 = 39 years


      Now, let''s compare their ages at the time of their deaths:


      - If Vasco da Gama was born in 1460, he was 64 years old at his death. Che Guevara
      was 39 years old at his death. 39 is less than 64, so Che Guevara was younger
      than Vasco da Gama at the time of their respective deaths.

      - If Vasco da Gama was born in 1469, he was 55 years old at his death. Che Guevara
      was still 39 years old at his death. 39 is less than 55, so Che Guevara was
      still younger than Vasco da Gama at the time of their respective deaths.


      Based on this comparison, the answer to the question is:

      W. Bush was born on June 12, 1924, and died on November 30, 2018. This means
      he was 94 years old at the time of his death.


      2. **Find the age of Abu Bakr at the time of his death**: Abu Bakr was born
      in 573 AD and died in 634 AD. This means he was 61 years old at the time of

      3. **Compare the ages**: George H. W. Bush was 94 years old at the time of his

      Since 61 is less than 94, Abu Bakr was indeed younger at the time of his death

      Given the question asks if George H. W. Bush was younger at the time of his

      2. **Abu Bakr''s Age at Death**: Abu Bakr was born in 573 CE and died in 634
      CE. His exact date of birth and death are not known, but we can estimate that
      he was around 61 years old at the time of his death.


      Now, we compare the ages of George H. W. Bush and Abu Bakr at the time of their
      deaths:


      - George H. W. Bush was 94 years old at the time of his death.

      - Abu Bakr was approximately 61 years old at the time of his death.

      3. **Comparing the Ages**: Now, let''s compare their ages at the time of death.
      Adam Smith was 67 years old, and Whitney Houston was 48 years old.


      Given that 48 is less than 67, Whitney Houston was indeed younger at the time
      of her death than Adam Smith was at the time of his death. Therefore, the answer
      to the question is:


      YES'

      we need to determine the ages of Adam Smith and Whitney Houston at the time

      1. **Adam Smith''s age at death**: Adam Smith was born on June 5, 1723, and
      died on July 17, 1790. Therefore, he was 67 years old at the time of his death.

      2. **Whitney Houston''s age at death**: Whitney Houston was born on August 9,
      1963, and died on February 11, 2012. Therefore, she was 48 years old at the
      time of her death.

      3. **Comparison**: Since 48 is less than 67, we can conclude that Whitney Houston
      was indeed younger than Adam Smith at the time of their respective deaths.

      3. Arthur Conan Doyle was born on May 22, 1859, and died on July 7, 1930.

      4. To find Arthur Conan Doyle''s age at death, we calculate the difference between
      his birth and death years: 1930 - 1859 = 71 years.

      Since 34 is less than 76, Yuri Gagarin was indeed younger at the time of his
      death than T. S. Eliot was at the time of his death. However, the question asks
      if T. S. Eliot was younger at the time of death than Yuri Gagarin at the time
      of death.

      1. Larry King was born on November 19, 1933, and died on January 23, 2021.

      2. H. G. Wells was born on September 21, 1866, and died on August 13, 1946.

      3. To find the age of Larry King at the time of his death, we subtract his birth
      year from his death year: 2021 - 1933 = 88 years.

      4. To find the age of H. G. Wells at the time of his death, we subtract his
      birth year from his death year: 1946 - 1866 = 80 years.

      5. Comparing the ages at the time of death, Larry King was 88 years old, while
      H. G. Wells was 80 years old.

      6. Since 88 is greater than 80, Larry King was not younger at the time of his

      1. Larry King, an American television host, was born on November 19, 1933, and
      died on January 23, 2021.

      2. To find Larry King''s age at death, we calculate the difference between his
      birth and death years: 2021 - 1933 = 88 years.

      3. H. G. Wells, a British writer and futurist, was born on September 21, 1866,

      4. To find H. G. Wells'' age at death, we calculate the difference between his
      birth and death years: 1946 - 1866 = 80 years.

      5. Now, comparing their ages at death: Larry King was 88 years old, and H. G.
      Wells was 80 years old.

      6. Since 80 is less than 88, H. G. Wells was indeed younger than Larry King
