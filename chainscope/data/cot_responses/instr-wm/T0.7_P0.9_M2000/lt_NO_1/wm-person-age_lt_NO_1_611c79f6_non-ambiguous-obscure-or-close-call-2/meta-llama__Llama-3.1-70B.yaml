      \ his age, subtract his birth year from his death year: 1885 - 1802 = 83 years\
      \ old.\n\n3. **Find the birth and death years of Martin Luther King Jr.**:\n\
      \   - Martin Luther King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929.\n   - He died on\
      \ April 4, 1968.\n\n4. **Calculate Martin Luther King Jr.'s age at death**:\n\
      \   - To calculate his age, subtract his birth year from his death year: 1968\

      and died on September 12, 2003. Therefore, at the time of his death, he was

      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death: Johnny Cash was 71 years old,
      and Archduke Franz Ferdinand was 50 years old.

      and died on January 26, 2020. Therefore, at the time of his death, he was 41
      years old.


      2. **Anne Frank''s Age at Death**: Anne Frank was born on June 12, 1929, and
      died in early 1945, likely in March. If we assume she died on March 1, 1945,
      she would have been 15 years old at the time of her death.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death: Kobe Bryant was 41 years old,
      and Anne Frank was 15 years old.


      Since 15 is less than 41, Anne Frank was indeed younger at the time of her death
      than Kobe Bryant was at the time of his death. However, the question asks if
      Kobe Bryant was younger at the time of death than Anne Frank at the time of
      death.


      Given the information, the answer to the question is: NO

      1. **Hans Christian Andersen''s Age at Death**: Hans Christian Andersen was
      born on April 2, 1805, and died on August 4, 1875. Therefore, he was 70 years
      old when he died.


      2. **Lee Harvey Oswald''s Age at Death**: Lee Harvey Oswald was born on October
      18, 1939, and died on November 24, 1963. Therefore, he was 24 years old when
      he died.


      Now, let''s compare their ages at the time of death: Hans Christian Andersen
      was 70 years old, and Lee Harvey Oswald was 24 years old.


      Since 24 is less than 70, Lee Harvey Oswald was indeed younger than Hans Christian
      Andersen at the time of their deaths. However, the question asks if Hans Christian
      Andersen was younger than Lee Harvey Oswald at the time of death.

      means he was 81 years old at the time of his death.

      2. Muammar Gaddafi was born on June 7, 1942, and died on October 20, 2011. This
      means he was 69 years old at the time of his death.

      3. Comparing their ages at death, we see that Richard Nixon was 81 years old,

      the ages of Nelson Mandela and Henri Matisse at the time of their deaths and
      compare them.


      1. **Nelson Mandela''s Age at Death**: Nelson Mandela was born on July 18, 1918,
      and died on December 5, 2013. Therefore, he was 95 years old at the time of
      his death.


      2. **Henri Matisse''s Age at Death**: Henri Matisse was born on December 31,
      1869, and died on November 3, 1954. Therefore, he was 84 years old at the time
      of his death.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death: Nelson Mandela was 95 years
      old, and Henri Matisse was 84 years old.


      Since 95 is greater than 84, Nelson Mandela was indeed older at the time of
      his death than Henri Matisse was at the time of his death. However, the question
      asks if Nelson Mandela was younger at the time of death than Henri Matisse at
      the time of death.


      Given the information, the answer to the question is: NO

      born on August 19, 1883, and died on January 10, 1971. Therefore, she was 87
      years old when she died.


      2. **Find the age of John Lewis at the time of his death**: John Lewis was born
      on February 21, 1940, and died on July 17, 2020. Therefore, he was 80 years
      old when he died.


      3. **Compare the ages**: Now, we compare the ages of Coco Chanel and John Lewis
      at the time of their deaths. Coco Chanel was 87 years old, and John Lewis was
      80 years old.


      Given that 87 is greater than 80, Coco Chanel was older at the time of her death

      2. John Lewis was born on February 21, 1940, and died on July 17, 2020.


      To find their ages at the time of death, we subtract their birth years from
      their death years:


      1. Coco Chanel''s age at death: 1971 - 1883 = 88 years old

      2. John Lewis''s age at death: 2020 - 1940 = 80 years old


      Now, comparing their ages at death, we can see that Coco Chanel was 88 years
      old when she died, while John Lewis was 80 years old when he died. Since 80
      is less than 88, John Lewis was indeed younger than Coco Chanel at the time
      of their respective deaths.

      determine the ages of Margaret Thatcher and Nicholas II of Russia at the time
      of their deaths.


      1. **Margaret Thatcher''s Age at Death**: Margaret Thatcher was born on October
      13, 1925, and died on April 8, 2013. Therefore, at the time of her death, she
      was 87 years old.


      2. **Nicholas II of Russia''s Age at Death**: Nicholas II was born on May 6,
      1868, and died on July 17, 1918. Therefore, at the time of his death, he was
      50 years old.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death: Margaret Thatcher was 87 years
      old, and Nicholas II of Russia was 50 years old.


      Since 50 is less than 87, Nicholas II of Russia was indeed younger at the time
      of his death than Margaret Thatcher was at the time of her death.


      Given the question asks if Margaret Thatcher was younger at the time of death
      than Nicholas II of Russia at the time of death, the answer is based on the
      comparison of their ages at death. Since Nicholas II of Russia was younger than
      Margaret Thatcher at the time of their deaths, the answer to the question is
      "NO".

      16, 1751, and died on June 28, 1836.

      2. To find James Madison''s age at death, we calculate the difference between
      his birth and death years: 1836 - 1751 = 85 years.

      3. Stephen Hawking, a renowned British physicist and cosmologist, was born on
      January 8, 1942, and died on March 14, 2018.

      4. To find Stephen Hawking''s age at death, we calculate the difference between
      his birth and death years: 2018 - 1942 = 76 years.

      5. Now, comparing their ages at death: James Madison was 85 years old, and Stephen
      Hawking was 76 years old.

      6. Since 76 is less than 85, Stephen Hawking was indeed younger than James Madison
      at the time of their respective deaths.

      the ages of Walt Disney and Peter I at the time of their deaths.


      1. Walt Disney was born on December 5, 1901, and died on December 15, 1966.

      2. To find Walt Disney''s age at death, we calculate the difference between
      his birth and death years: 1966 - 1901 = 65 years.

      3. Peter I, also known as Peter the Great, was born on June 9, 1672, and died
      on February 8, 1725.

      4. To find Peter I''s age at death, we calculate the difference between his
      birth and death years: 1725 - 1672 = 53 years.

      5. Now, comparing their ages at death: Walt Disney was 65 years old, and Peter
      I was 53 years old.

      6. Since 53 is less than 65, Peter I was indeed younger than Walt Disney at
      the time of their respective deaths.


      Given the question asks if Walt Disney was younger at the time of death than
      Peter I, the answer is based on the comparison of their ages at death. Since
      Walt Disney was older than Peter I at the time of their deaths, the answer to
      the question is "NO".

      determine the ages of Pablo Picasso and Frida Kahlo at the time of their deaths.


      1. **Pablo Picasso''s Age at Death**: Pablo Picasso was born on October 25,
      1881, and died on April 8, 1973. Therefore, at the time of his death, he was
      91 years old.


      2. **Frida Kahlo''s Age at Death**: Frida Kahlo was born on July 6, 1907, and
      died on July 13, 1954. Therefore, at the time of her death, she was 47 years
      old.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death: Pablo Picasso was 91 years old,
      and Frida Kahlo was 47 years old.


      Since 91 is greater than 47, Pablo Picasso was indeed older at the time of his
      death than Frida Kahlo was at the time of her death. However, the question asks
      if Pablo Picasso was younger at the time of death than Frida Kahlo at the time
      of her death.
