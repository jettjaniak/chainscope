      1. Lewis Carroll (born Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) was born on January 27, 1832,

      3. Determine the birth and death years of Steve Jobs.

      4. Calculate Jobs'' age at the time of his death.

      5. Compare the two ages.


      **Johannes Gutenberg:**

      - Birth year: c. 1398

      - Death year: 1468
