      - Died: December 25, 2006

      - Age at death: 73 years old


      4. Comparing their ages at death:

      - Churchill: 90 years

      - Brown: 73 years

      - 90 is greater than 73


      5. The question asks if Churchill was younger at death than Brown.

      Since Churchill lived to 90 and Brown to 73, Churchill was older at death.

      Therefore, the answer is: NO'
    e6030307-f5d4-4818-a7c7-50f9f135fc7a: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Let me find Queen Victoria''s lifespan:

      * Born: May 24, 1819

      * Died: January 22, 1901

      * Age at death: 81 years old


      2. Let me find Bob Marley''s lifespan:

      * Born: February 6, 1945

      * Died: May 11, 1981

      * Age at death: 36 years old


      3. Compare the ages at death:

      * Queen Victoria: 81 years

      * Bob Marley: 36 years

      * 81 is greater than 36


      Therefore, Queen Victoria was NOT younger than Bob Marley at their time of death.


      NO'

      - Born: January 27, 1756

      - Died: December 5, 1791

      - Age at death: 35 years old


      3. Now I can compare their ages at death:

      - Peter the Great: 52 years

      - Mozart: 35 years

      - 52 is greater than 35


      Therefore, Peter the Great was NOT younger than Mozart at their time of death.

      - Kalam: Died at age 83 years, 9 months, 12 days

      - Asimov: Died at age 72 years, 3 months, 4 days


      3. Comparing their ages at death:

      - Kalam was 83 years old

      - Asimov was 72 years old

      - 83 is greater than 72


      4. Therefore, Kalam was older at his time of death than Asimov

      - Ferdinand Magellan: 41 years at death

      - 79 is greater than 41


      Therefore, Ella Fitzgerald was NOT younger at her time of death than Magellan
