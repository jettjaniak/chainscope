      3. **Comparison**: Now, we compare the ages of Victor Hugo (83 years) and Martin
      Luther King Jr. (39 years) at the time of their deaths to determine if Victor
      Hugo was younger than Martin Luther King Jr. at their respective times of death.


      Given that 83 is greater than 39, Victor Hugo was not younger than Martin Luther
      King Jr. at their time of death.

      let''s first establish the ages of both historical figures at the time of their
      death.


      1. **Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR):** FDR was born on January 30, 1882, and
      died on April 12, 1945. Therefore, he was 63 years old at the time of his death.


      2. **Grigori Rasputin:** Rasputin was born on January 21, 1869, and died on
      December 29, 1916. Therefore, he was 47 years old at the time of his death.


      Now, comparing their ages at death:


      - FDR was 63 years old.

      - Rasputin was 47 years old.


      Given that 47 is less than 63, we can conclude that Franklin Delano Roosevelt
      was indeed older at the time of his death than Grigori Rasputin. Therefore,
      to answer the question of whether FDR was younger at the time of death than
      Rasputin, the answer is:


      YES'

      - Jane Austen died at the age of 41 (since she died in 1817 and was born in

      age, this would make him between 29 and 35 years old at the time of his death.


      3. **Compare their ages at death**: Given that Elizabeth I was 69 years old
      when she died and William Wallace was between 29 and 35 years old, Elizabeth
      I was older than William Wallace at the time of their respective deaths.


      Therefore, considering the question of whether Elizabeth I of England was younger
      at the time of her death than William Wallace at the time of his death, the
      answer is: **NO**.'

      let''s first gather the necessary information about the ages of Benito Mussolini
      and Freddie Mercury at the time of their deaths.


      1. **Benito Mussolini''s Age at Death**: Benito Mussolini was born on July 29,
      1883, and died on April 28, 1945. So, at the time of his death, he was 61 years
      old.


      2. **Freddie Mercury''s Age at Death**: Freddie Mercury was born on September
      5, 1946, and died on November 24, 1991. So, at the time of his death, he was
      45 years old.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death:


      - Benito Mussolini was 61 years old.

      - Freddie Mercury was 45 years old.


      Since 45 is less than 61, Freddie Mercury was younger than Benito Mussolini
      at the time of their respective deaths.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Benito Mussolini was younger at their time
      of death than Freddie Mercury at their time of death is: **NO**.'

      1. Find the birth and death dates of Benito Mussolini.

      2. Find the birth and death dates of Freddie Mercury.

      3. Calculate the age of Benito Mussolini at the time of his death.

      4. Calculate the age of Freddie Mercury at the time of his death.

      5. Compare the ages calculated in steps 3 and 4.


      Step 1: Benito Mussolini was born on July 29, 1883, and died on April 28, 1945.


      Step 2: Freddie Mercury was born on September 5, 1946, and died on November
      24, 1991.


      Step 3: To find Mussolini''s age at death, we calculate the difference between
      his death year and birth year: 1945 - 1883 = 62 years. Since he died in April
      and was born in July, he was 61 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 4: To find Freddie Mercury''s age at death, we calculate the difference
      between his death year and birth year: 1991 - 1946 = 45 years. Since he died
      in November and was born in September, he was 45 years old at the time of his

      1. **Rosa Parks'' Age at Death**: Rosa Parks was born on February 4, 1913, and

      2. Determine the age of Heinrich Himmler at the time of his death.

      3. Compare these ages to answer the question.


      Step 1: Muhammad Ali was born on January 17, 1942, and died on June 3, 2016.
      Therefore, at the time of his death, Muhammad Ali was 74 years old.

      Step 3: Comparing the ages, Muhammad Ali was 74 years old at the time of his
      death, and Heinrich Himmler was 44 years old at the time of his death. Since
      74 is greater than 44, Muhammad Ali was older at the time of his death than
      Heinrich Himmler was at the time of his death.

      1. **Determine the age of Alexander Hamilton at the time of his death**: Alexander
      Hamilton died on July 12, 1804, from a gunshot wound after a duel with Aaron
      Burr. He was born on January 11, 1755, or January 11, 1757, depending on the
      source, but most historians agree on 1755 or 1757. Assuming the earlier birth
      year (1755), Hamilton was 49 years old at the time of his death.


      2. **Determine the age of Malcolm X at the time of his death**: Malcolm X was
      assassinated on February 21, 1965. He was born on May 19, 1925. Therefore, Malcolm
      X was 39 years old at the time of his death.


      3. **Compare the ages**: Now, we compare the ages of Alexander Hamilton and
      Malcolm X at the time of their deaths to determine if Hamilton was younger than
      Malcolm X.


      Given that Alexander Hamilton was 49 years old at his death and Malcolm X was
      39 years old at his death, it is clear that Malcolm X was younger than Alexander
      Hamilton at the time of their respective deaths.

      1. **Max Wilhelm Carl Weber**: First, we need to identify who Max Wilhelm Carl
      Weber was. Max Weber (1864-1920) was a German sociologist, philosopher, and
      political economist. He is best known for his thesis of the "Protestant Ethic"
      and for his ideas on bureaucracy. Max Weber died in 1920 at the age of 56.

      statesman, and historian who led the Free French Forces during World War II.
      He later founded the French Fifth Republic, served as its first president, and
      is considered one of the most important figures in French history. Charles de
      Gaulle died in 1970 at the age of 79.

    1398b076-98be-4567-b10f-7542132cba62: 'To answer this question,
      we need to follow these steps:


      1. Determine the age of Abraham Lincoln at the time of his death.

      2. Determine the age of James Cook at the time of his death.

      3. Compare these ages to decide if Lincoln was younger than Cook at their respective
      times of death.


      Step 1: Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, and died on April 15,
      1865. Therefore, at the time of his death, Abraham Lincoln was 56 years old.


      Step 2: James Cook was born on November 7, 1728, and died on February 14, 1779.
      Therefore, at the time of his death, James Cook was 50 years old.


      Step 3: Comparing the ages, Lincoln was 56 years old at his death, and Cook
      was 50 years old at his death. Since 56 is greater than 50, Lincoln was not
      younger than Cook at their time of death.


      The answer is: NO'

      death.


      1. **Abraham Lincoln**: Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States,
      was born on February 12, 1809, and died on April 15, 1865. To find his age at
      the time of death, we calculate the difference between his birth year and death
      year: 1865 - 1809 = 56 years. Since his birthday (February 12) had passed before
      his death (April 15), he was 56 years old at the time of his death.


      2. **James Cook**: James Cook, the British explorer, was born on November 7,
      1728, and died on February 14, 1779. To find his age at the time of death, we
      calculate the difference between his birth year and death year: 1779 - 1728
      = 51 years. Since his birthday (November 7) had not occurred yet in the year
      of his death (February 14), he was still 50 years old at the time of his death.


      Given these ages at the time of death:

      - Abraham Lincoln was 56 years old.

      Now, comparing their ages:

      - Abraham Lincoln (56 years old) was older than James Cook (50 years old) at

      2. Determine the age of Henri Matisse at the time of his death.

      3. Compare these two ages to decide if Nelson Mandela was younger than Henri
      Matisse at the time of their deaths.


      Step 1: Nelson Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, and died on December 5, 2013.

      1. **Elvis Presley''s death**: Elvis Presley was born on January 8, 1935, and
      died on August 16, 1977. To find his age at death, we calculate the difference:

      1. **Franz Kafka''s Age at Death**: Franz Kafka was born on July 3, 1883, and
      died on June 3, 1924. Therefore, he was 40 years old when he died.


      2. **Heath Ledger''s Age at Death**: Heath Ledger was born on April 4, 1979,
      and died on January 22, 2008. Therefore, he was 28 years old when he died.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death:


      - Franz Kafka died at the age of 40.

      - Heath Ledger died at the age of 28.


      Since 28 is less than 40, Heath Ledger was younger than Franz Kafka at the time
      of their respective deaths.

      1. Determine the year of death for Alighiero di Bellincione.

      2. Determine the year of death for Osama bin Laden.

      3. Find the birth year for both individuals to calculate their age at death.

      4. Compare their ages at the time of death.


      Step 1: Alighieri di Bellincione''s year of death is not widely documented in
      the information I have access to, but it is known that he was the father of
      Dante Alighieri, who was born in 1265. Assuming Alighiero di Bellincione was
      at least 20 years old at the time of Dante''s birth, he would have been born
      no later than 1245. Given the average lifespan during the Middle Ages, if we
      assume he lived into his 60s or 70s, his year of death could be estimated to
      be around 1310 or later, but this is speculative without a precise date.


      Step 2: Osama bin Laden died in 2011.


      Step 3: Since we don''t have an exact birth year for Alighiero di Bellincione,
      let''s use the estimated range. If he was born around 1245, and assuming he
      died around 1310 (which is a rough estimate and could be inaccurate), he would
      have been approximately 65 years old at the time of his death. Osama bin Laden
      was born on March 10, 1957, and died on May 2, 2011, making him 54 years old
      at the time of his death.


      Step 4: Comparing their ages, Osama bin Laden was 54 years old when he died,
      and Alighiero di Bellincione, based on rough estimates, could have been around
      65 years old. However, the exact age of Alighiero di Bellincione at death is
      not certain, but based on the estimate provided, he would have been older than
      Osama bin Laden at the time of death.

    55318a83-7a5b-4e4b-ab6a-8914b80ead2b: 'To answer this question,
      we need to determine the ages of both Alighieri di Bellincione and Osama bin
      Laden at the time of their deaths and then compare these ages.


      1. **Identify Alighieri di Bellincione**: Alighieri di Bellincione is known
      to be the father of Dante Alighieri, the famous Italian poet. Dante Alighieri
      was born in 1265, which means his father, Alighieri di Bellincione, was likely
      born in the early to mid-13th century.


      2. **Determine Alighieri di Bellincione''s Death**: The exact date of Alighieri
      di Bellincione''s death is not widely documented in the provided information,
      but given that Dante Alighieri was born in 1265, it''s reasonable to infer that
      his father likely died sometime after this, possibly in the late 13th century.


      3. **Identify Osama bin Laden**: Osama bin Laden was a founder of the terrorist
      organization al-Qaeda, responsible for the September 11 attacks on the United
      States in 2001. He was born on March 10, 1957.


      4. **Determine Osama bin Laden''s Death**: Osama bin Laden was killed on May
      2, 2011, during a raid by US Navy SEALs at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.
      At the time of his death, he was 54 years old.


      5. **Comparison**: Given that Alighieri di Bellincione''s exact age at death
      is not specified but considering he was the father of Dante Alighieri (born
      1265), if we assume Alighieri di Bellincione died even as late as his 60s or
      70s (a reasonable assumption given the times), we can proceed with the comparison.
      Since Osama bin Laden died at the age of 54, if Alighieri di Bellincione died
      at any age above 54, the statement would be false. However, without a precise
      age for Alighieri di Bellincione, the assumption must lean towards historical
      norms and the fact that Osama bin Laden''s age at death is known.


      Given the lack of specific information about Alighieri di Bellincione''s age
      at death but considering typical lifespans and the known age of Osama bin Laden
      at his death, it''s reasonable to make an educated guess based on historical
      context. However, without a clear age for Alighieri di Bellincione, the question''s
      premise relies on uncertain data for one of the subjects.


      Given the steps and the need for a definitive answer based on the information
      provided and typical historical context, and acknowledging the incomplete data
      for Alighieri di Bellincione:

      1. **Identify the birth and death dates of Alighiero di Bellincione**: Unfortunately,
      specific dates for Alighiero di Bellincione are not widely documented in available

      of the time. Assuming an average lifespan in the 12th century to be around 35-40
      years (though this varied greatly depending on social class, with nobles like
      Alighiero likely living longer), and considering that he was an ancestor of

      the age of 54.


      5. **Comparison**: Without precise dates for Alighiero di Bellincione, a direct
      comparison is challenging. However, considering that Osama bin Laden was 54
      at the time of his death and assuming that Alighiero di Bellincione, living
      in the 12th century, might not have reached such an advanced age due to the
      lower life expectancy of the time, it''s plausible that Alighiero could have
      been younger than Osama bin Laden at the time of his death.


      Given the speculative nature of Alighiero di Bellincione''s age due to the lack

      based on general historical trends and the assumption that Alighiero di Bellincione
      did not live into his 50s, which would have been unusually old for his time,
      the likelihood is that he was indeed younger at the time of his death than Osama

      Step 3: Comparing the ages, John Adams was 90 years old at his death, and Alfred
      Nobel was 63 years old at his death. Since 63 is less than 90, John Adams was
      not younger than Alfred Nobel at their respective times of death. Instead, Alfred
      Nobel was younger than John Adams at their times of death.


      Given the question asks if John Adams was younger at their time of death than
      Alfred Nobel, the answer is:

      2, 1755, and died on October 16, 1793. Therefore, she was 37 years old at the
      time of her death.


      Now, comparing their ages at death:

      - Sigmund Freud was 83 years old.

      - Marie Antoinette was 37 years old.


      Since 83 is greater than 37, Sigmund Freud was older at the time of his death

      4. To find Stephen Hawking''s age at death, we calculate the difference between
      his birth and death years: 2018 - 1942 = 76 years.

      5. Now, comparing their ages at death: James Madison was 85 years old, and Stephen
      Hawking was 76 years old.

      6. Since 76 is less than 85, Stephen Hawking was indeed younger than James Madison
      at the time of their respective deaths.


      YES.'

      the time of their deaths.


      1. **Ella Fitzgerald''s Age at Death**: Ella Fitzgerald was born on April 25,
      1917, and died on June 15, 1996. Therefore, Ella Fitzgerald was 79 years old
      at the time of her death.


      2. **Ferdinand Magellan''s Age at Death**: Ferdinand Magellan was born circa
      1480 and died on April 27, 1521. Therefore, Ferdinand Magellan was approximately
      41 years old at the time of his death.


      Given these ages, we can now compare them:


      - Ella Fitzgerald died at the age of 79.

      - Ferdinand Magellan died at the age of approximately 41.


      Since 79 is greater than 41, Ella Fitzgerald was older at the time of her death
      than Ferdinand Magellan was at the time of his death.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Ella Fitzgerald was younger at their time of
      death than Ferdinand Magellan at their time of death is: **NO**.'

      \ and Age at Death for Al\u012B ibn Ab\u012B \u1E6C\u0101lib:**\n   - Al\u012B\
      \ ibn Ab\u012B \u1E6C\u0101lib was born in 601 AD and died in 661 AD. This means\
      \ he lived for approximately 60 years.\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - Given that\
      \ Al\u012B ibn Ab\u012B \u1E6C\u0101lib died at the age of 60, for Jimmy Carter\
      \ to be younger at the time of death, he would need to die before reaching the\
      \ age of 60.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Jimmy Carter is still alive as\
      \ of my last update and was born in 1924, he has already surpassed the age of\
      \ 60. Therefore, the question's premise relies on a hypothetical or future event\
      \ (Jimmy Carter's death) to make a direct comparison. However, based on the\
      \ information provided and considering the logical steps, we are comparing Jimmy\
      \ Carter's potential age at death to Al\u012B ibn Ab\u012B \u1E6C\u0101lib's\
      \ age at death (60 years).\n\nGiven the above steps and understanding the question\
      \ asks for a comparison based on ages at death, and considering Jimmy Carter\
      \ has not died as of my last update and thus cannot be directly compared in\
      \ the past tense:\n\nThe final answer is: **NO**"

      \ at his death. Thus, the premise of the question, which seeks a comparison\
      \ based on their ages at death, indicates that Jimmy Carter cannot be younger\

      1. **Charles Dickens'' Age at Death**: Charles Dickens was born on February
      7, 1812, and died on June 9, 1870. Therefore, he was 58 years old at the time
      of his death.


      2. **Jim Morrison''s Age at Death**: Jim Morrison was born on December 8, 1943,
      and died on July 3, 1971. Therefore, he was 27 years old at the time of his
      death.


      Now, comparing the ages:

      - Charles Dickens was 58 years old when he died.

      - Jim Morrison was 27 years old when he died.


      Given that 27 is less than 58, we can conclude that Charles Dickens was indeed
      older at the time of his death than Jim Morrison was at the time of his death.
      Therefore, the answer to whether Charles Dickens was younger at the time of
      death than Jim Morrison is **NO**.'

      2. **Terry Pratchett''s birth and death dates**: Pratchett was born on April
      28, 1948, and died on March 12, 2015.


      Now, let''s calculate their ages at the time of death:


      - **Renoir''s age at death**: Born in 1841 and died in 1919, so he was 78 years
      old at the time of his death.

      - **Pratchett''s age at death**: Born in 1948 and died in 2015, so he was 66
      years old at the time of his death.


      Given these ages, we can conclude:


      Since 66 (Pratchett''s age at death) is less than 78 (Renoir''s age at death),
      Pratchett was indeed younger at the time of his death than Renoir. Therefore,
      the answer to whether Renoir was younger at the time of his death than Pratchett
      at the time of his death is **NO**.'

      1. **Deng Xiaoping''s Age at Death**: Deng Xiaoping was born on August 22, 1904,
      and died on February 19, 1992. Therefore, he was 87 years old at the time of
      his death.


      2. **Carl Sagan''s Age at Death**: Carl Sagan was born on November 9, 1934,

      Comparing the two ages:

      - Deng Xiaoping was 87 years old at his death.

      - Carl Sagan was 62 years old at his death.


      Since 62 is less than 87, Carl Sagan was indeed younger than Deng Xiaoping at
