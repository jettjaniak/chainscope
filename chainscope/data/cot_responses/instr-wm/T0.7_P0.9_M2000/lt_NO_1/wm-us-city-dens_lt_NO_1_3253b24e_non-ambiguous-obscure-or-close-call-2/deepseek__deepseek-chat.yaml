      DC is less densely populated than Compton, CA, we need to compare their population
      densities.


      ### Step 1: Find the population and area of Washington, DC

      - **Population**: As of 2023, Washington, DC has an estimated population of
      approximately 700,000.

      - **Area**: Washington, DC covers about 68.34 square miles.


      ### Step 2: Calculate the population density of Washington, DC

      \[

      \text{Population Density} = \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Area}} = \frac{700,000}{68.34}
      \approx 10,240 \text{ people per square mile}

      \]


      ### Step 3: Find the population and area of Compton, CA

      - **Population**: As of 2023, Compton, CA has an estimated population of approximately
      95,000.

      - **Area**: Compton, CA covers about 10.1 square miles.


      ### Step 4: Calculate the population density of Compton, CA

      \[

      \text{Population Density} = \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Area}} = \frac{95,000}{10.1}
      \approx 9,406 \text{ people per square mile}

      \]


      ### Step 5: Compare the population densities

      - Washington, DC: ~10,240 people per square mile

      - Compton, CA: ~9,406 people per square mile


      ### Conclusion

      Washington, DC is **more densely populated** than Compton, CA.

    60ad9ec7-006a-4285-846d-633422f07739: 'To determine whether Miami,
      FL is less densely populated than San Diego, CA, we need to compare their population
      densities. Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Find the population of Miami, FL**: As of the most recent data, Miami has
      a population of approximately 442,000 people.

      2. **Find the land area of Miami, FL**: Miami covers an area of about 56 square
      miles.

      3. **Calculate the population density of Miami, FL**: Population density is
      calculated as population divided by land area. For Miami, this is approximately
      442,000 / 56 = **7,893 people per square mile**.

      4. **Find the population of San Diego, CA**: San Diego has a population of approximately
      1.4 million people.

      5. **Find the land area of San Diego, CA**: San Diego covers an area of about
      372 square miles.

      6. **Calculate the population density of San Diego, CA**: For San Diego, this
      is approximately 1,400,000 / 372 = **3,763 people per square mile**.


      Now, comparing the two:

      - Miami, FL: 7,893 people per square mile

      - San Diego, CA: 3,763 people per square mile

      \ question step by step to determine whether Manhattan, NY is less densely populated\
      \ than Malibu, CA.\n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\n**Population Density:**\
      \ This is a measure of the number of people living per unit area, usually expressed\
      \ as persons per square mile or square kilometer.\n\n**Manhattan, NY:** One\
      \ of the five boroughs of New York City, known for its skyscrapers, cultural\
      \ institutions, and high population density.\n\n**Malibu, CA:** A city in Los\
      \ Angeles County, California, known for its beaches, celebrity homes, and relatively\
      \ lower population density compared to urban centers.\n\n### Gathering Population\
      \ and Area Data\n\nTo compare the population densities, we need two key pieces\
      \ of information for both Manhattan and Malibu:\n\n1. **Total Population:**\
      \ The number of people living in each area.\n2. **Total Area:** The size of\
      \ the area in square miles or square kilometers.\n\n#### Manhattan, NY\n\n-\
      \ **Population:** As of the latest data, Manhattan has a population of approximately\
      \ 1.6 million people.\n  \n- **Area:** Manhattan covers about 22.83 square miles\
      \ (59.1 square kilometers).\n\n#### Malibu, CA\n\n- **Population:** Malibu has\
      \ a population of around 12,000 people.\n  \n- **Area:** Malibu covers about\
      \ 19.82 square miles (51.3 square kilometers).\n\n*Note: These population figures\
      \ are approximate and can vary based on the latest census or estimates.*\n\n\
      ### Calculating Population Density\n\nPopulation Density = Total Population\
      \ / Total Area\n\nLet's calculate this for both Manhattan and Malibu.\n\n####\
      \ Manhattan, NY\n\nPopulation Density = 1,600,000 people / 22.83 square miles\
      \ \u2248 70,000 people per square mile\n\n#### Malibu, CA\n\nPopulation Density\
      \ = 12,000 people / 19.82 square miles \u2248 605 people per square mile\n\n\
      *Note: These calculations are rounded for simplicity.*\n\n### Comparing the\
      \ Densities\n\nNow, let's compare the two:\n\n- **Manhattan, NY:** ~70,000 people\
      \ per square mile\n- **Malibu, CA:** ~605 people per square mile\n\n### Analyzing\
      \ the Results\n\nClearly, Manhattan has a significantly higher population density\
      \ compared to Malibu. In fact, Manhattan's population density is over 100 times\
      \ greater than that of Malibu.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the calculations:\n\
      \n- **Manhattan, NY** has a much higher population density (~70,000 people/sq\
      \ mi) than **Malibu, CA** (~605 people/sq mi).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the\
      \ question is:\n\n**NO, Manhattan, NY is not less densely populated than Malibu,\
      \ CA.** In fact, Manhattan is much more densely populated."
