      city.**  Major cities generally have higher population densities than national
      parks.

      2. **Yosemite Valley is within a national park.**  While it has tourist facilities
      and some park employee housing, it''s primarily dedicated to preserving nature
      and thus will have a lower resident population.

      3. **Population density compares population to area.**  While Yosemite Valley
      might see a large influx of tourists, density calculations typically use *resident*
      population, which will be much lower than Nashville''s.
