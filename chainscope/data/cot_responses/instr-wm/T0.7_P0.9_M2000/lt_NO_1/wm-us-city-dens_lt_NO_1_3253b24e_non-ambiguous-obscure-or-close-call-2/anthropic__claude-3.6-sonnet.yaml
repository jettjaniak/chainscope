      housing, it is primarily a natural area with very limited permanent residential
      development.


      4) Nashville has a population density of around 1,400 people per square mile.


      5) Yosemite Valley has very few permanent residents (mostly park staff) in its
      small developed areas, with the vast majority of its area being undeveloped
      natural landscape.

      1) First, let''s consider Nashville, TN:

      - Nashville is a major city with a population around 700,000

      - Its land area is approximately 526 square miles

      - This gives it a population density of roughly 1,300 people per square mile


      2) Now, let''s consider Yosemite Valley, CA:

      - Yosemite Valley is a natural valley within Yosemite National Park

      - It''s primarily a tourist destination, not a residential area

      - Only park staff and some seasonal workers live there

      - The year-round population is very small, likely under 1,000 people

      - The valley floor is about 7 square miles in area


      3) Comparing:

      - Even with a generous estimate of 1,000 people in Yosemite Valley

      - That would give Yosemite Valley a density of about 140 people per square mile

      - Nashville''s 1,300 people per square mile is much higher


      NO - Nashville is NOT less densely populated than Yosemite Valley. Nashville
      is significantly more densely populated.'
