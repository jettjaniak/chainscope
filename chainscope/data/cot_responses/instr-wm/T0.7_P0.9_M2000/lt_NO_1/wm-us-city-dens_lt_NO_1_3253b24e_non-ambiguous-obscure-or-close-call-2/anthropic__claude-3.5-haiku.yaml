      - Nashville has a population density of around 1,310 people per square mile

      - Yosemite Valley has a population density close to zero


      4. Therefore, Nashville is MORE densely populated than Yosemite Valley.


      Answer: NO, Nashville is NOT less densely populated than Yosemite Valley.'
