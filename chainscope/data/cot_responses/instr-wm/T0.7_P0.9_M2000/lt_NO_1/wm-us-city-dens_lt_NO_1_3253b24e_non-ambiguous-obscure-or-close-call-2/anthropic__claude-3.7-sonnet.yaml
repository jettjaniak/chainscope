      - Manhattan in particular is one of the most densely populated areas in the
      US

      - NYC has approximately 8-9 million people in a relatively small land area


      Step 3: Recall facts about Houston:

      - Houston is known for being more spread out

      - It has more suburban-style development

      - Houston has fewer high-rises and more single-family homes

      - Houston has expanded outward rather than upward

      area

      New York City has more people and less land area than Houston, making it significantly
      more densely populated.


      NO, New York, NY is not less densely populated than Houston, TX. In fact, it

      - New York City has a population of approximately 8.8 million people.

      Miami has a population of approximately 450,000-500,000 people and covers about

      Manhattan is one of the five boroughs of New York City. It''s known for being
      extremely densely populated with high-rise buildings, apartment complexes, and
      a large population in a relatively small area. Manhattan is famous for its skyscrapers

      Step 2: Consider what I know about Malibu, CA.

      Malibu is a beach city in Los Angeles County, California. It''s known for sprawling
      beach homes, large properties, and a relatively small population spread across
      a coastal area. Malibu is characterized by luxury homes on large lots and significant
      open space.

      - Santa Monica has approximately 90,000-95,000 residents.

      - The city covers about 8.4 square miles of land area.

      Step 2: Let me determine the population density of San Antonio, TX.

      - San Antonio is a major city in Texas.

      - San Antonio has approximately 1.5-1.6 million residents.

      - The city covers about 460-500 square miles of land area.

      population density.


      Step 2: Now let''s consider Yosemite Valley, CA. Yosemite Valley is part of
      Yosemite National Park, which is a protected wilderness area. National parks
      generally have very few permanent residents, with mostly temporary visitors
      (tourists).


      Step 3: Let me think about the actual population densities:

      - Nashville has a population of over 600,000 people in its city proper, spread
      across about 526 square miles.

      - Yosemite Valley is only about 7 square miles in area and has very few permanent
      residents - mostly just park staff and possibly some concession workers. The
      permanent population would likely be in the hundreds at most.


      Step 4: Comparing the densities:

      - Nashville: Hundreds of thousands of people across hundreds of square miles

      - Yosemite Valley: At most a few hundred people in 7 square miles


      Even if Yosemite Valley has a few hundred people in its small area, Nashville
      would still have a much higher population density due to its large urban population.


      NO, Nashville, TN is not less densely populated than Yosemite Valley, CA. Nashville
      is more densely populated.'

      Step 1: I need to find the population density of Beverly Hills, CA.

      - Beverly Hills has a population of approximately 32,500 people.

      - Beverly Hills has an area of about 5.7 square miles.

      - This gives Beverly Hills a population density of roughly 5,700 people per
      square mile.


      Step 2: I need to find the population density of Dallas, TX.

      - Dallas has a population of approximately 1.3 million people.

      - Dallas has an area of about 385 square miles.

      - This gives Dallas a population density of roughly 3,400 people per square
      mile.


      Step 3: Compare the two densities.

      - Beverly Hills: ~5,700 people per square mile

      - Dallas: ~3,400 people per square mile

      - Since 5,700 > 3,400, Beverly Hills is MORE densely populated than Dallas.


      NO, Beverly Hills, CA is not less densely populated than Dallas, TX. It is actually
      more densely populated.'
