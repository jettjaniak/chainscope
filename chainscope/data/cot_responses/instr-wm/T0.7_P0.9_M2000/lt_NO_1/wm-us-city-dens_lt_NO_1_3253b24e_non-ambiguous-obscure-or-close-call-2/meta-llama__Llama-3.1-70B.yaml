      densities of these two cities.


      2. **Find population data**: We can find population data for both cities on
      the United States Census Bureau website. According to the 2020 Census, the population
      of Miami Beach is 82,890, and the population of Phoenix is 1,708,127.


      3. **Find area data**: We also need the areas of these cities to calculate population
      density. The area of Miami Beach is 15.2 square miles, and the area of Phoenix
      is 516.7 square miles.


      4. **Calculate population density**: Population density is calculated by dividing
      the population by the area. For Miami Beach, the population density is 82,890
      / 15.2 = 5,454.9 people per square mile. For Phoenix, the population density
      is 1,708,127 / 516.7 = 3,306.7 people per square mile.


      5. **Compare population densities**: Now that we have calculated the population
      densities, we can compare them. Since the population density of Miami Beach
      (5,454.9) is higher than the population density of Phoenix (3,306.7), Miami
      Beach is **NOT** less densely populated than Phoenix.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: **NO**'

      we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Find the population density of Boston, MA**: We can find this information
      from reliable sources like the United States Census Bureau or other reputable
      websites. According to the 2020 census data, the population of Boston is approximately
      675,647 people, and its land area is about 48.4 square miles. To calculate the
      population density, we divide the population by the land area, which gives us
      a population density of approximately 13,967 people per square mile for Boston.


      2. **Find the population density of Seattle, WA**: Following the same process
      as in step 1, we find that the population of Seattle is approximately 737,015
      people, and its land area is about 83.8 square miles. This gives us a population
      density of approximately 8,792 people per square mile for Seattle.


      3. **Compare the population densities**: Now that we have the population densities
      of both cities, we can compare them. Since Boston has a higher population density
      (13,967 people per square mile) than Seattle (8,792 people per square mile),
      we can conclude that Boston is more densely populated than Seattle.


      Therefore, the answer to the question, "Is Boston, MA less densely populated
      than Seattle, WA?" is **NO**'

      we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Define population density**: Population density is the number of people
      living in a given area, usually expressed as people per square mile or square
      kilometer.


      2. **Find the population and area of Denver, CO**: As of the latest available

      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Define population density**: Population density is the number of people
      per unit area, typically expressed as people per square mile or square kilometer.


      2. **Find the population and area data for Nashville, TN**: According to the
      United States Census Bureau, as of 2020, the population of Nashville is approximately
      670,820, and the land area is about 525.94 square miles.


      3. **Find the population and area data for Yosemite Valley, CA**: Yosemite Valley
      is part of Yosemite National Park. According to the National Park Service, as
      of 2020, the population of Yosemite National Park is approximately 3,985, and
      the land area is about 747,956 acres, or approximately 1,168.4 square miles.


      4. **Calculate the population density of Nashville, TN**: We can calculate the
      population density of Nashville by dividing its population by its land area:
      670,820 people / 525.94 square miles = approximately 1,275 people per square
      mile.


      5. **Calculate the population density of Yosemite Valley, CA**: We can calculate
      the population density of Yosemite Valley by dividing its population by its
      land area: 3,985 people / 1,168.4 square miles = approximately 3.4 people per
      square mile.


      6. **Compare the population densities**: Now that we have calculated the population
      densities of Nashville and Yosemite Valley, we can compare them. Nashville has
      a population density of approximately 1,275 people per square mile, while Yosemite
      Valley has a population density of approximately 3.4 people per square mile.


      Based on these calculations, we can conclude that Nashville is more densely
      populated than Yosemite Valley.

      \ let's break it down into the necessary steps:\n\n1. **Understand the concept\
      \ of population density**: Population density is a measure of the number of\
      \ people living in a given area. It is calculated by dividing the total population\
      \ by the total area.\n\n2. **Find the population and area of Beverly Hills,\
      \ CA**: As of my last update, Beverly Hills has a population of approximately\
      \ 34,169 people and covers an area of about 5.71 square miles (14.8 km\xB2).\n\
      \n3. **Calculate the population density of Beverly Hills, CA**: Using the numbers\
      \ from step 2, the population density of Beverly Hills can be calculated as\
      \ 34,169 people / 5.71 square miles \u2248 5,986 people per square mile.\n\n\
      4. **Find the population and area of Dallas, TX**: As of my last update, Dallas\
      \ has a population of approximately 1.35 million people and covers an area of\
      \ about 385.8 square miles (999 km\xB2).\n\n5. **Calculate the population density\
      \ of Dallas, TX**: Using the numbers from step 4, the population density of\
      \ Dallas can be calculated as 1.35 million people / 385.8 square miles \u2248\
      \ 3,500 people per square mile.\n\n6. **Compare the population densities**:\
      \ Now that we have the population densities of both cities, we can compare them.\
      \ Beverly Hills has a population density of approximately 5,986 people per square\
      \ mile, while Dallas has a population density of approximately 3,500 people\
      \ per square mile.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Based on the calculations, Beverly\
      \ Hills is more densely populated than Dallas.\n\nThe final answer is: **NO**"
