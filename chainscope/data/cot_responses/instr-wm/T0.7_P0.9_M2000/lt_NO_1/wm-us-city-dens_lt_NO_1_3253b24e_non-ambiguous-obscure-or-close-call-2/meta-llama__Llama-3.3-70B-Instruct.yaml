      let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Identify the Population Density of Washington, D.C.**: First, we need to
      know the population density of Washington, D.C. According to the United States
      Census Bureau, as of 2020, the population density of Washington, D.C. is approximately
      11,665 people per square mile (4,501 people per square kilometer).


      2. **Identify the Population Density of Compton, CA**: Next, we need the population
      density of Compton, California. As of the 2020 census, the population density
      of Compton is about 10,719 people per square mile (4,134 people per square kilometer).


      3. **Compare the Population Densities**: Now, we compare the two. Washington,
      D.C. has a population density of approximately 11,665 people per square mile,
      while Compton, CA has a population density of about 10,719 people per square
      mile.


      4. **Determine the Answer**: Given that Washington, D.C. has a higher population
      density than Compton, CA, we can conclude that Washington, D.C. is not less
      densely populated than Compton, CA.


      The final answer is: NO'

      by the total area of the city.


      1. **Find the population and area of Miami Beach, FL**: As of my last update,
      Miami Beach has a population of approximately 91,000 people and covers an area
      of about 15.2 square miles (39.3 square kilometers).


      2. **Calculate the population density of Miami Beach, FL**: Using the numbers
      from step 1, the population density of Miami Beach would be around 91,000 people
      / 15.2 square miles = approximately 6,000 people per square mile.


      3. **Find the population and area of Phoenix, AZ**: Phoenix has a much larger
      population and area compared to Miami Beach. As of my last update, Phoenix has
      a population of about 1.73 million people and covers an area of approximately
      516.7 square miles (1,339 square kilometers).


      4. **Calculate the population density of Phoenix, AZ**: Using the numbers from
      step 3, the population density of Phoenix would be around 1,730,000 people /
      516.7 square miles = approximately 3,350 people per square mile.


      5. **Compare the population densities**: Now, we compare the calculated population
      densities of Miami Beach, FL (approximately 6,000 people per square mile) and
      Phoenix, AZ (approximately 3,350 people per square mile).


      Given these calculations, Miami Beach, FL, is more densely populated than Phoenix,
      AZ. Therefore, the answer to whether Miami Beach, FL, is less densely populated
      than Phoenix, AZ, is **NO**.'

      CA is less densely populated than San Antonio, TX, let''s break down the information
      we need and the steps to find the answer:


      1. **Find the population density of Santa Monica, CA**: Population density is
      calculated by dividing the total population by the land area. We need the most
      recent or available data for Santa Monica''s population and its land area.


      2. **Find the population density of San Antonio, TX**: Similarly, we need the
      total population and land area of San Antonio to calculate its population density.


      3. **Compare the population densities**: Once we have the population densities
      of both cities, we can compare them to determine which one is less densely populated.


      Given the nature of the question, let''s proceed with general knowledge and
      available data as of my last update:


      - **Santa Monica, CA**: Known for being a part of the Los Angeles metropolitan
      area and having a high population density due to its popularity and limited
      land area (it''s a coastal city with a relatively small size).


      - **San Antonio, TX**: This is a larger city by land area compared to Santa
      Monica and has a significant population but is generally considered to have
      a lower population density compared to many California cities, especially those
      in the Los Angeles area.


      Without exact figures at hand, we can use general trends:

      - Cities in California, especially in the LA area, tend to have higher population
      densities compared to many cities in Texas, due to factors like land availability,
      urban planning, and population growth patterns.


      Based on these general trends and the characteristic differences between coastal
      California cities and major Texas cities, the answer to whether Santa Monica,
      CA is less densely populated than San Antonio, TX would likely be "NO", because
      Santa Monica is expected to have a higher population density than San Antonio
      given its smaller size and location in a densely populated metropolitan area.


      The final answer is: $\boxed{NO}$'

      \ City**: \n   - For Santa Monica, CA, we need the population and the land area.\n\
      \   - For San Antonio, TX, we also need the population and the land area.\n\n\
      2. **Calculate the Population Density of Each City**:\n   - Population density\
      \ is calculated by dividing the total population by the land area.\n   - The\
      \ formula for population density is: Population Density = Total Population /\
      \ Land Area.\n   - The unit of measurement for population density can be people\
      \ per square mile or people per square kilometer, depending on the units used\
      \ for land area.\n\n3. **Compare the Population Densities**:\n   - Once we have\
      \ the population densities of Santa Monica, CA, and San Antonio, TX, we can\
      \ compare them directly.\n   - If the population density of Santa Monica, CA,\
      \ is lower than that of San Antonio, TX, then Santa Monica is less densely populated.\n\
      \nGiven the general knowledge:\n- Santa Monica, CA, is a city in Los Angeles\

      \ population, but its population density is generally lower compared to many\
      \ coastal California cities due to its larger size and different urban planning.\n\
      \nWithout the exact numbers but considering general trends and characteristics:\n\
      - Santa Monica is a smaller, coastal city in a highly populated metropolitan\
      \ area (Los Angeles), which tends to have higher population densities.\n- San\

      we need to consider the population density of both Nashville, TN, and Yosemite
      Valley, CA.


      1. **Nashville, TN Population Density**: As the capital of Tennessee, Nashville
      is a major city with a significant population. According to the United States
      Census Bureau, as of 2020, the city of Nashville has a population of approximately
      691,084 people, and its land area is about 525.94 square miles. This gives Nashville
      a population density of roughly 1,313 people per square mile.


      2. **Yosemite Valley, CA Population Density**: Yosemite Valley is a small valley
      within Yosemite National Park in California. It''s not a city or a town in the
      conventional sense but rather a part of a national park. However, for the sake
      of comparison, we can consider the population density of Yosemite National Park
      or specifically areas within it that are inhabited, like Yosemite Valley. The
      permanent population within Yosemite National Park is very small, with most
      residents being park employees and their families. The total area of Yosemite
      National Park is approximately 747,956 acres (or about 1,168 square miles),
      and the permanent population is less than 1,000 people. Focusing on Yosemite
      Valley, which is about 7 square miles in area, and considering that the majority
      of the park''s population lives in the valley area, we can estimate the population
      density to be extremely low, significantly less than 1 person per acre (which
      translates to less than 143 people per square mile, considering 1 acre = 0.001563
      square miles, but for simplicity and due to the nature of the question, we''ll
      focus on the concept rather than precise calculation).


      Given these considerations, **Nashville, TN**, with its significant population
      and urban development, has a **much higher population density** than **Yosemite
      Valley, CA**, which is a natural, sparsely populated area within a national
      park.

      square kilometer), though this can vary slightly depending on the source and
      the exact boundaries considered.


      2. **Identify Yosemite Valley, CA**: Yosemite Valley is a small, scenic valley
      within Yosemite National Park in California. It''s not a city in the conventional
      sense but a part of a national park. The population of Yosemite Valley itself
      is very small and mostly consists of park employees and visitors. The permanent
      residential population is minimal.


      3. **Determine the Population Density of Yosemite Valley, CA**: Given that Yosemite
      Valley is a small area with a very small permanent population, its population
      density is extremely low. While exact figures might be hard to come by due to
      its unique status as part of a national park, it''s reasonable to infer that
      the density is significantly lower than that of a major city like Nashville.


      4. **Compare the Population Densities**: Nashville, being a major city, has
      a substantial population density compared to most areas in the United States.
      Yosemite Valley, with its minimal permanent population and large area dedicated
      to national parkland, has a very low population density.


      Based on these steps, it is reasonable to conclude that Nashville, TN is more
      densely populated than Yosemite Valley, CA. Therefore, the answer to whether
      Nashville, TN is less densely populated than Yosemite Valley, CA is:

      itself is very small, typically consisting of park rangers, employees, and a
      few residents. The population can fluctuate but is generally considered to be
      less than 1,000 people. Yosemite Valley covers an area of approximately 3.5
      square miles. Thus, its population density is quite low, significantly less
      than major cities.


      3. **Compare the population densities**: Given the information, Nashville, TN,
      has a population density of about 1,313 people per square mile, while Yosemite
      Valley, with its tiny population and small area, would have a very low population
      density. Even with a generous estimate of 1,000 residents in Yosemite Valley,
      its population density would be approximately 286 people per square mile (1,000
      residents / 3.5 square miles).


      Based on this comparison, Nashville, TN, is more densely populated than Yosemite
      Valley, CA. Therefore, the answer to whether Nashville, TN, is less densely
      populated than Yosemite Valley, CA, is:


      NO'
    5ff772e5-ba37-4deb-9c60-45e5ab613bcf: '<think></think>To answer this question,
      we need to determine the population density of Nashville, TN, and Yosemite Valley,
      CA.


      1. **Nashville, TN Population Density**: As of my last update, Nashville has
      a population of around 691,084 people and covers an area of approximately 525.94
      square miles. This gives Nashville a population density of about 1,314 people
      per square mile.


      2. **Yosemite Valley, CA Population Density**: Yosemite Valley is a small area
      within Yosemite National Park, and its population is relatively tiny compared
      to major cities like Nashville. The permanent residents in Yosemite Valley are
      mostly park employees and their families, with numbers that can fluctuate but
      are generally very low, often cited in the hundreds. Yosemite Valley itself
      covers about 7 square miles. Assuming a generous estimate of 1,000 residents
      for simplicity, this would put Yosemite Valley''s population density at approximately
      143 people per square mile.


      Given these calculations:


      - Nashville, TN, has a population density of approximately 1,314 people per
      square mile.

      - Yosemite Valley, CA, has a population density of approximately 143 people
      per square mile.


      Therefore, based on the calculated population densities, Nashville, TN, is more
      densely populated than Yosemite Valley, CA.


      The answer is: **NO**'

      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Understand the Terms**: First, we need to understand what "less densely
      populated" means. It refers to an area having a smaller number of people living
      in it per unit of area (like square mile or square kilometer) compared to another
      area.


      2. **Identify the Areas**: We are comparing Nashville, TN, with Yosemite Valley,
      CA. Nashville is a city, while Yosemite Valley is a part of Yosemite National
      Park, known for its natural beauty and not typically considered a residential
      or urban area in the traditional sense.


      3. **Population Density of Nashville, TN**: As of my last update, Nashville
      has a population density of approximately 1,500 people per square mile (579
      people per square kilometer). This is a relatively standard density for a city
      in the United States.


      4. **Population Density of Yosemite Valley, CA**: Yosemite Valley is a small
      area within Yosemite National Park, and it''s primarily visited for its natural
      attractions rather than being a residential area. The population density here
      is very low because it''s not designed for human habitation on a large scale
      but rather for conservation and tourism. The exact population density can be
      difficult to determine due to its nature, but it''s significantly lower than
      that of urban areas. For the sake of comparison, if we consider the broader
      Yosemite National Park, its population density is less than 2 people per square
      mile (less than 1 person per square kilometer) because it''s vast and mostly
      wilderness.


      5. **Comparison**: Given the above, Nashville, TN, is significantly more densely
      populated than Yosemite Valley, CA, when comparing the city''s residential population
      density to the very low population density of a national park area like Yosemite
      Valley.


      Based on this step-by-step analysis, the answer to whether Nashville, TN, is
      less densely populated than Yosemite Valley, CA, is: **NO**'

      let''s break it down into parts:


      1. **Determine the population density of Nashville, TN**: Nashville is a city
      with a significant population. As of my last update, Nashville has a population
      of around 691,084 people and covers approximately 525.94 square miles. This
      gives Nashville a population density of about 1,314 people per square mile.


      2. **Determine the population density of Yosemite Valley, CA**: Yosemite Valley
      is a small area within Yosemite National Park. While the park itself is vast,
      Yosemite Valley is relatively tiny, covering about 3.5 square miles. The population
      within Yosemite Valley is very small, mostly consisting of park rangers, hotel
      staff, and a few residents, totaling a few hundred people at most. For simplicity,
      let''s use a generous estimate of 1,000 people for the sake of calculation,
      recognizing that the actual population is much smaller. This would result in
      a population density of approximately 286 people per square mile (1,000 people
      / 3.5 square miles).


      3. **Compare the population densities**: With Nashville having about 1,314 people
      per square mile and Yosemite Valley having approximately 286 people per square
      mile (based on our generous estimate), it''s clear that Nashville is more densely
      populated than Yosemite Valley.


      Given these calculations, the answer to whether Nashville, TN is less densely
      populated than Yosemite Valley, CA is:


      NO'
    ded5c6a9-0fd0-4906-b74e-d3ececd1b393: '<think></think>To answer this question,
      we need to consider the population density of both Nashville, TN, and Yosemite
      Valley, CA.


      1. **Nashville, TN Population Density**: As of the last available census data,
      Nashville has a population of approximately 691,084 people within its city limits,
      and it covers about 525.6 square miles. This gives Nashville a population density
      of roughly 1,314 people per square mile.


      2. **Yosemite Valley, CA Population Density**: Yosemite Valley is a small area
      within Yosemite National Park. The population figures for Yosemite Valley itself
      are not typically reported separately, as it''s not an incorporated city or
      town. However, we can consider the population density of Yosemite National Park
      as a whole for context. The park has a very low population density, given its
      vast area of approximately 747,956 acres (1,168 square miles) and a total permanent
      population of fewer than 1,000 people, mostly park employees and their families.
      This results in a population density far less than 1 person per square mile
      for the entire park.


      3. **Comparison**: Given that Nashville, TN, has a population density of approximately
      1,314 people per square mile and Yosemite Valley, CA (or Yosemite National Park
      as a whole), has a population density of less than 1 person per square mile,
      Nashville is significantly more densely populated than Yosemite Valley.


      Considering these steps, the answer to whether Nashville, TN, is less densely
      populated than Yosemite Valley, CA, is **NO**.'

      a few residents. The area of Yosemite Valley is roughly 3.5 square miles. The
      permanent population is less than 1,000 people, which would put the population
      density at less than 286 people per square mile. However, Yosemite Valley is
      a tourist destination and can see large numbers of visitors, but these are not
      permanent residents.
