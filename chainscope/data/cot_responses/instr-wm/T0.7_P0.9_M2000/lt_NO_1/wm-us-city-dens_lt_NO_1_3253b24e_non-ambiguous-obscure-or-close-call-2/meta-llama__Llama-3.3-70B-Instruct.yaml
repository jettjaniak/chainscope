      density of Compton, California. As of the 2020 census, the population density
      of Compton is about 10,719 people per square mile (4,134 people per square kilometer).


      3. **Compare the Population Densities**: Now, we compare the two. Washington,
      D.C. has a population density of approximately 11,665 people per square mile,
      while Compton, CA has a population density of about 10,719 people per square
      mile.

      we need and the steps to find the answer:


      1. **Find the population density of Santa Monica, CA**: Population density is
      calculated by dividing the total population by the land area. We need the most
      recent or available data for Santa Monica''s population and its land area.


      2. **Find the population density of San Antonio, TX**: Similarly, we need the

      3. **Compare the population densities**: Once we have the population densities
      of both cities, we can compare them to determine which one is less densely populated.


      Given the nature of the question, let''s proceed with general knowledge and
      available data as of my last update:


      - **Santa Monica, CA**: Known for being a part of the Los Angeles metropolitan
      area and having a high population density due to its popularity and limited
      land area (it''s a coastal city with a relatively small size).


      - **San Antonio, TX**: This is a larger city by land area compared to Santa
      Monica and has a significant population but is generally considered to have
      a lower population density compared to many California cities, especially those
      in the Los Angeles area.


      Without exact figures at hand, we can use general trends:

      - Cities in California, especially in the LA area, tend to have higher population
      densities compared to many cities in Texas, due to factors like land availability,
      urban planning, and population growth patterns.


      Based on these general trends and the characteristic differences between coastal
      California cities and major Texas cities, the answer to whether Santa Monica,
      CA is less densely populated than San Antonio, TX would likely be "NO", because
      Santa Monica is expected to have a higher population density than San Antonio
      given its smaller size and location in a densely populated metropolitan area.

      \   - For San Antonio, TX, we also need the population and the land area.\n\n\
      2. **Calculate the Population Density of Each City**:\n   - Population density\

      \nWithout the exact numbers but considering general trends and characteristics:\n\
      - Santa Monica is a smaller, coastal city in a highly populated metropolitan\

      for simplicity, this would put Yosemite Valley''s population density at approximately
      143 people per square mile.


      Given these calculations:


      - Nashville, TN, has a population density of approximately 1,314 people per
      square mile.

      - Yosemite Valley, CA, has a population density of approximately 143 people
      per square mile.


      Therefore, based on the calculated population densities, Nashville, TN, is more
      densely populated than Yosemite Valley, CA.

      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Understand the Terms**: First, we need to understand what "less densely
      populated" means. It refers to an area having a smaller number of people living
      in it per unit of area (like square mile or square kilometer) compared to another
      area.


      2. **Identify the Areas**: We are comparing Nashville, TN, with Yosemite Valley,
      CA. Nashville is a city, while Yosemite Valley is a part of Yosemite National
      Park, known for its natural beauty and not typically considered a residential
      or urban area in the traditional sense.


      3. **Population Density of Nashville, TN**: As of my last update, Nashville
      has a population density of approximately 1,500 people per square mile (579
      people per square kilometer). This is a relatively standard density for a city
      in the United States.


      4. **Population Density of Yosemite Valley, CA**: Yosemite Valley is a small
      area within Yosemite National Park, and it''s primarily visited for its natural
      attractions rather than being a residential area. The population density here
      is very low because it''s not designed for human habitation on a large scale
      but rather for conservation and tourism. The exact population density can be
      difficult to determine due to its nature, but it''s significantly lower than
      that of urban areas. For the sake of comparison, if we consider the broader
      Yosemite National Park, its population density is less than 2 people per square
      mile (less than 1 person per square kilometer) because it''s vast and mostly
      wilderness.


      5. **Comparison**: Given the above, Nashville, TN, is significantly more densely
      populated than Yosemite Valley, CA, when comparing the city''s residential population
      density to the very low population density of a national park area like Yosemite
      Valley.


      Based on this step-by-step analysis, the answer to whether Nashville, TN, is
      less densely populated than Yosemite Valley, CA, is: **NO**'

      gives Nashville a population density of about 1,314 people per square mile.


      2. **Determine the population density of Yosemite Valley, CA**: Yosemite Valley
      is a small area within Yosemite National Park. While the park itself is vast,
      Yosemite Valley is relatively tiny, covering about 3.5 square miles. The population
      within Yosemite Valley is very small, mostly consisting of park rangers, hotel
      staff, and a few residents, totaling a few hundred people at most. For simplicity,
      let''s use a generous estimate of 1,000 people for the sake of calculation,
      recognizing that the actual population is much smaller. This would result in
      a population density of approximately 286 people per square mile (1,000 people
      / 3.5 square miles).


      3. **Compare the population densities**: With Nashville having about 1,314 people
      per square mile and Yosemite Valley having approximately 286 people per square
      mile (based on our generous estimate), it''s clear that Nashville is more densely
