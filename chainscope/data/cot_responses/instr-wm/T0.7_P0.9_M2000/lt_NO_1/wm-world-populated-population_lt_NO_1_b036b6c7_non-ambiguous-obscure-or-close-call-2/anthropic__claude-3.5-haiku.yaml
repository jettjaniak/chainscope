    2878728a-8a71-4470-81b5-bd78dbcecc29: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s find the population of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi:

      - Abu Dhabi is one of the seven emirates of the United Arab Emirates

      - Its population is approximately 1.5 million people (as of recent estimates)


      2. Next, let''s find the populations of Colombia and Cuba:

      - Colombia''s population is about 50 million people

      - Cuba''s population is about 11 million people


      3. Comparing populations:

      - Colombia alone has about 50 million people

      - This is far more than Abu Dhabi''s 1.5 million

      - Even Cuba with 11 million is significantly more populous than Abu Dhabi


      4. The question asks if Abu Dhabi is LESS populous than Colombia AND Cuba combined

      - Colombia (50M) + Cuba (11M) = 61 million people

      - Abu Dhabi (1.5M) is much smaller than 61 million


      5. Therefore, Abu Dhabi IS less populous than Colombia and Cuba.
