      over 5 million.  The question specifically asks about the *City of Sydney*.

      An urban agglomeration includes a city and its surrounding suburbs/connected
      urban areas.  Therefore, the population of Montreal''s urban agglomeration will
      be significantly larger than just the city itself.

      This is a province in Italy, encompassing a major metropolitan area.  Therefore,
      it''s likely to have a substantial population.

      2. **Tahiti:** This is a single island in French Polynesia, a much smaller geographical
      area. While a popular tourist destination, its overall population is likely
      smaller than a major Italian province.

      3. **Comparison:**  A large province in Italy versus a single island in the
      Pacific.  The population of the Province of Naples is almost certainly greater
      than that of Tahiti.

      areas. It''s a major metropolitan area.

      2. **Tahiti:** This is an island in French Polynesia, a much smaller area.

      island, even a relatively well-known one like Tahiti.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.

      3.3 million.

      Island.**  Long Island, New York, is a heavily populated island.  We''re talking
      millions of people.


      * **Step 2: Identify Machupicchu District.** This district in Peru contains
      the famous Incan citadel of Machu Picchu, but also surrounding towns and villages.


      * **Step 3: Compare populations.**  While Machu Picchu itself has a small resident
      population (mostly working in tourism), the entire district''s population is
      still going to be far smaller than the millions living on Long Island.


      * **Step 4: Answer the question.** NO. Long Island is *more* populous than Machupicchu
      District.
