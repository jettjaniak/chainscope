      - It''s a market town in Warwickshire, England

      - Famous as Shakespeare''s birthplace

      - Population is around 30,000 people


      3. Comparing the numbers:

      - Ho Chi Minh City: ~9,000,000

      - Stratford-upon-Avon: ~30,000

      - 9 million is much larger than 30,000

      South Holland)

      - Holland: ~6.5 million

      1. First, I need to clarify that "Holland" technically refers to a region of
      the Netherlands, but it''s commonly used to refer to the entire country of the
      Netherlands.


      2. The Netherlands (Holland) has approximately 17.4 million people.


      3. Cairo (El Cairo) is a city in Egypt with approximately 10 million people
      in the city proper, or around 20 million in its metropolitan area.


      4. Comparing the numbers:

      - Netherlands: 17.4 million

      - Cairo metro area: ~20 million

      - Cairo city proper: ~10 million


      5. Using the larger metropolitan area number for Cairo (20 million) compared
      to the Netherlands (17.4 million)


      NO - Holland (the Netherlands) is not less populous than Cairo. The numbers
      are fairly close, but Cairo''s metropolitan area (20 million) is actually more

      - The Netherlands has approximately 17.8 million people (2023)

      - Cairo has approximately 9.5 million people in the city proper, or around 20.9

      4. Since we need to compare with Cairo (not its metro area), we should use the

      - Transylvania has approximately 7 million inhabitants

      - Suez city has approximately 750,000 inhabitants


      3) Comparing the numbers:

      - 7 million (Transylvania) > 750,000 (Suez)

      - Transylvania is about 9 times more populous than Suez


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO (Transylvania is NOT less populous than Suez)'
