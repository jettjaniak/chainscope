    bda7fd92-bb77-473f-9254-0041ba3e26f1: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Gangs of Wasseypur (2012):

      - Known for being an epic-length film

      - Actually released as two separate parts

      - Total runtime is approximately 5 hours and 20 minutes


      2. Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro (1983):

      - A classic comedy film

      - Runtime is approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes (around 135 minutes)


      3. Comparing the two:

      - Gangs of Wasseypur (320 minutes) is significantly longer than Jaane Bhi Do
      Yaaro (135 minutes)


      4. Therefore, Gangs of Wasseypur is NOT shorter than Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro.


      Answer: NO'

      1. First, let''s check the runtime of The Godfather:

      - The Godfather (1972) has a runtime of approximately 175 minutes (2 hours and
      55 minutes)


      2. Next, let''s check the runtime of The Hobbit:

      - The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012) is about 169 minutes

      - The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013) is about 161 minutes

      - The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (2014) is about 144 minutes


      3. If we consider the entire Hobbit trilogy:

      - Total runtime is approximately 474 minutes (7 hours and 54 minutes)


      4. Comparing the runtimes:

      - The Godfather (175 minutes) is much shorter than the entire Hobbit trilogy
      (474 minutes)

      - Even the shortest Hobbit movie (Battle of the Five Armies at 144 minutes)
      is still shorter than the entire Godfather


      5. Therefore, The Godfather is shorter than The Hobbit.
