      1. First, let''s look at the areas:

      - Los Angeles County is a very large county in California

      - Shinjuku is a special ward (district) in Tokyo, Japan


      2. Los Angeles County area:

      - Los Angeles County covers approximately 4,751 square miles (12,310 square
      kilometers)

      - This is an extremely large area that includes many cities and unincorporated
      regions


      3. Shinjuku area:

      - Shinjuku is a much smaller administrative district

      - Shinjuku covers approximately 18.23 square kilometers (about 7.04 square miles)


      4. Comparing the areas:

      - Los Angeles County (4,751 sq miles) is MUCH larger than Shinjuku (7.04 sq
