    28de19fd-5446-456d-84fa-f2999bba06ad: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Muhammad''s lifespan:

      - Muhammad was born around 570 CE

      - He died in 632 CE

      - So he lived approximately 62 years


      2. Miguel de Cervantes'' lifespan:

      - Cervantes was born in 1547

      - He died in 1616

      - So he lived approximately 69 years


      3. Comparing their ages:

      - Muhammad died at around 62 years old

      - Cervantes died at around 69 years old

      - 69 is greater than 62


      4. Conclusion:

      Cervantes lived longer than Muhammad, so he did NOT die younger.
