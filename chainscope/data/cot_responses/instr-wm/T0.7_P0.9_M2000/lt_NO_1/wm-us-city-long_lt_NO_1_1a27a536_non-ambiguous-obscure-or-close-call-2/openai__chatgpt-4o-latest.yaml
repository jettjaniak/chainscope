      Step 1: Understand the general locations of both cities.

      - Washington, DC is located in the northeastern part of the United States.

      - Atlanta, GA is located in the southeastern part of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider their longitudes.

      - Longitude measures how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian.
      A location with a smaller (more negative) longitude in the western hemisphere
      is farther west.


      Step 3: Find approximate longitudes:

      - Washington, DC: approximately 77 degrees west

      - Atlanta, GA: approximately 84 degrees west


      Step 4: Compare the longitudes:

      - 84 (Atlanta) is greater than 77 (DC), meaning Atlanta is farther west than
      Washington, DC.
