      1. **Locate Boston, MA**: Boston is a major city in the northeastern United
      States, located in the state of Massachusetts. It is situated on the eastern
      coast of the US, near the Atlantic Ocean.


      2. **Locate Manhattan, NY**: Manhattan is one of the five boroughs of New York
      City, located in the state of New York. It is also on the eastern coast of the
      US, south of Boston.


      3. **Compare their positions**: Boston is north of Manhattan, but in terms of
      east-west positioning, Boston is slightly east of Manhattan. This is because
      the coastline of Massachusetts extends further east than the coastline of New
      York.
