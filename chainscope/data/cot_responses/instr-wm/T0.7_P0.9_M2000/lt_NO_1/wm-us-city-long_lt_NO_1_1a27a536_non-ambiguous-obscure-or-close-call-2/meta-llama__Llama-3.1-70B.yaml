      towards the setting sun, or in geographical terms, towards the Western part
      of the globe or a region.


      4. **Compare locations**: Given that Texas is located south of Oregon, it is
      not west of Oregon. Instead, Oregon is west of Texas.


      5. **Conclusion**: Based on the steps above, the answer to whether Austin, TX,
      is located west of Portland, OR, is: NO

      while California is on the West Coast. This means that California is generally
      west of New York.


      3. **Compare specific locations**: Yosemite Valley is located in the Sierra
      Nevada mountain range in eastern California. Queens is located on Long Island,
      which is part of the eastern coast of the United States.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since California is west of New York, and Yosemite Valley
      is located in eastern California, Queens is not west of Yosemite Valley. Instead,
      Queens is located east of Yosemite Valley.


      The answer is: **NO**'
