      1. **Identify the locations**: Denver, CO is the capital of Colorado, and Compton,

      2. **Determine the general direction**: We know that Colorado is generally east
      of California. This is because the United States is often divided into regions,
      with the Rocky Mountains (where Colorado is located) being east of the Sierra
      Nevada and the West Coast (where California is located).

      3. **Consider longitude**: Longitude can give us a precise east-west comparison.

      longitude increases as you move west in the Northern Hemisphere.

      4. **Apply geographical knowledge**: Knowing that the Rocky Mountains run north-south

      let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Detroit, MI (Michigan) and Seattle, WA (Washington)
      are the two cities in question.

      2. **Understand the geography**: The United States is divided into time zones
      and geographical regions that can help us understand the relative positions
      of cities. Michigan is in the Eastern Time Zone (ET), and Washington is in the
      Pacific Time Zone (PT).

      3. **Consider the general layout of the US**: The US is laid out roughly from
      east to west, with the East Coast being where states like New York and Florida
      are located, and the West Coast being where states like California, Oregon,
      and Washington are.

      4. **Specific locations of Detroit and Seattle**: Detroit, Michigan, is located
      in the northeastern part of the United States, near the Great Lakes. Seattle,
      Washington, is on the West Coast, near the Pacific Ocean.

      5. **Compare their positions**: Given that Detroit is in the eastern United
      States and Seattle is on the western edge of the United States, Detroit is east
      of Seattle.

    f4d3460e-e3b3-473c-a1cd-2ac4dc5bc576: 'To answer this question,
      we''ll break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Queens, NY, is a borough in New York City, located
      in the state of New York on the East Coast of the United States. Yosemite Valley,
      CA, is a valley located in Yosemite National Park in the state of California
      on the West Coast of the United States.


      2. **Determine the general geographical positions**: The East Coast is generally
      to the east of the West Coast in the United States. This means that any location
      on the East Coast (like Queens, NY) is east of any location on the West Coast
      (like Yosemite Valley, CA).


      3. **Apply the information to the question**: The question asks if Queens, NY,
      is located west of Yosemite Valley, CA. Given that Queens, NY, is on the East
      Coast and Yosemite Valley, CA, is on the West Coast, and considering the relative
      positions of the coasts, Queens, NY, must be east of Yosemite Valley, CA, not
      west.


      Therefore, based on the steps of reasoning, the answer is: **NO**'

      2. **Consider the longitude**: Longitude measures how far east or west a place
      is. Places west of the prime meridian have a negative longitude (in the Western
      Hemisphere), and places east have a positive longitude. However, since both
      cities are in the United States and thus in the Western Hemisphere, we''re comparing
      negative longitudes. New York City''s longitude is approximately -74 degrees,
      and Chicago''s is about -87.6 degrees.


      3. **Compare the longitudes**: Since New York City is at approximately -74 degrees
      and Chicago is at about -87.6 degrees, New York City is actually east of Chicago
