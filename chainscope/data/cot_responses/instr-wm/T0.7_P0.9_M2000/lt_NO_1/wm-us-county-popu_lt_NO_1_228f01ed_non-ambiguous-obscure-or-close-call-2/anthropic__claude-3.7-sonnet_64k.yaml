      the populations of two US counties: Orange County, CA and Richmond County, NY.


      Let me think about what I know about these counties:


      Orange County, CA is a large county in Southern California. It''s part of the
      Greater Los Angeles area and contains cities like Anaheim, Santa Ana, and Irvine.
      It''s generally known to be quite populous.


      Richmond County, NY is less familiar to me by that name, but I believe it''s
      actually the borough of Staten Island in New York City. Staten Island is one
      of the five boroughs of NYC, and is generally considered the least populous
      of the five boroughs.


      Given this background knowledge, I would guess that Orange County, CA is likely
      more populous than Richmond County, NY. But let me see if I can recall more
      specific population figures.


      Orange County, CA has a population of around 3 million people, if I recall correctly.


      Staten Island (Richmond County), NY has a population of around 500,000 people,
      if I recall correctly.


      So based on my knowledge, Orange County, CA (approximately 3 million) is MORE
      populous than Richmond County, NY (approximately 500,000).


      Therefore, the answer to "Is Orange County, CA less populous than Richmond County,
      NY?" would be NO.


      But let me double-check my numbers to make sure I''m giving accurate information.


      Orange County, CA is one of the most populous counties in the United States
      with a population of approximately 3.2 million (as of my last update).


      Richmond County, NY (Staten Island) has a population of approximately 470,000-500,000
      (as of my last update).


      So the answer is definitely NO, Orange County, CA is not less populous than
      Richmond County, NY. Orange County has a much larger population.</think># Is
      Orange County, CA less populous than Richmond County, NY?


      I need to determine the populations of both counties and compare them.


      ## Step 1: Identify the counties

      - Orange County is a major county in Southern California

      - Richmond County is the official name for Staten Island, one of the five boroughs
      of New York City


      ## Step 2: Recall approximate populations

      - Orange County, CA has a population of approximately 3.2 million people

      - Richmond County, NY (Staten Island) has a population of approximately 500,000
      people


      ## Step 3: Compare the populations

      Orange County (3.2 million) is significantly more populous than Richmond County
      (500,000)


      NO'

      - Richmond County is a county in New York State. Richmond County is actually
      Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City.


      Now I need to find their respective populations:


      Orange County, CA:

      Based on my knowledge, Orange County is quite populous with over 3 million residents.
      It''s home to cities like Anaheim, Santa Ana, Irvine, and Huntington Beach,
      and is the third most populous county in California after Los Angeles County

      - So Orange County is NOT less populous than Richmond County


      The answer is NO.</think># Analyzing County Populations


      To answer this question, I need to compare the populations of Orange County,
      CA and Richmond County, NY.


      ## Step 1: Identify Orange County, CA

      Orange County is a large county in Southern California that includes cities
      like Anaheim, Irvine, and Santa Ana. It''s known to be quite populous with approximately
      3.1-3.2 million residents.


      ## Step 2: Identify Richmond County, NY

      Richmond County is the official county name for Staten Island, which is one
      of the five boroughs of New York City. It has approximately 500,000 residents,
      making it the least populous borough in NYC.


      ## Step 3: Compare the populations

      - Orange County, CA: ~3.1 million

      - Richmond County, NY: ~500,000


      Since 3.1 million is greater than 500,000, Orange County has more people than
      Richmond County.


      ## Conclusion

      NO - Orange County, CA is not less populous than Richmond County, NY. In fact,
      it has approximately six times the population.'

      be aware of:


      Clark County, NV has seen significant growth and has around 2.3 million people
      according to recent estimates.


      Santa Clara County, CA has around 1.9-2.0 million people.


      So, based on my knowledge, Clark County, NV is NOT less populous than Santa

      First, Clark County, NV:

      Clark County is located in Nevada and includes Las Vegas, which is a major city.
      Las Vegas is known for its tourism, gambling, and entertainment industries.
      This is likely a fairly populous county, especially considering Nevada overall
      is not a highly populated state, and Las Vegas contains a significant portion
      of Nevada''s population.


      The population of Clark County, NV is approximately 2.3 million people (as of
      recent estimates).


      Second, Santa Clara County, CA:

      Santa Clara County is in California and includes San Jose and much of Silicon
      Valley. This is also a major population center with significant tech industry
      presence.


      The population of Santa Clara County, CA is approximately 1.9 million people
      (as of recent estimates).


      Comparing the two:

      Clark County, NV: According to the 2020 Census, the population was about 2,265,461.

      Santa Clara County, CA: According to the 2020 Census, the population was about

      ## Step 3: Compare the populations

      Clark County: ~2.3 million

      I need to determine which one has the larger population.


      New York County, NY is the official name for Manhattan, which is one of the
      five boroughs of New York City. Given that Manhattan is part of the largest
      city in the United States (New York City), I would expect it to have a very
      large population.


      Napa County, CA is known for wine production and is located north of San Francisco.
      While it has some population centers like the city of Napa, it''s generally
      considered a more rural, agricultural area.


      Based on my knowledge:

      - New York County (Manhattan) likely has over 1 million residents

      - Napa County probably has significantly fewer people, likely less than 200,000


      Let me try to recall more specific population figures:

      To answer this question, I need to determine the populations of both counties
      and compare them.


      1. New York County, NY is Manhattan borough of New York City, one of the most
      densely populated areas in the United States.

      2. New York County (Manhattan) has a population of approximately 1.6 million

      3. Napa County, CA is known for wine production in Northern California.

      4. Napa County has a much smaller population of approximately 140,000 people.

      5. Comparing these figures: 1.6 million is significantly larger than 140,000.


      Therefore, New York County is much MORE populous than Napa County, not less

      New York County is the official name for Manhattan in New York City, one of
      the five boroughs of NYC. Manhattan is a very densely populated urban area at
      the heart of one of the largest cities in the US.


      Napa County is a county in Northern California known for its wine production.
      It contains the Napa Valley, which is famous for its vineyards. It''s a more
      rural/suburban area.


      I need to estimate or recall the populations of these counties:


      1. New York County (Manhattan): Manhattan is densely populated and is a central
      borough of New York City. NYC as a whole has around 8-9 million people, and
      Manhattan is one of the five boroughs. I believe Manhattan has over 1.5 million
      residents - probably around 1.6 to 1.7 million.


      2. Napa County, CA: Napa County is much more sparsely populated. It''s known
      for vineyards and wine country, not for dense urban populations. I would estimate
      its population is likely under 150,000.


      Given these considerations, New York County (Manhattan) almost certainly has
      a much larger population than Napa County.


      So, is New York County, NY less populous than Napa County, CA? No, New York
      County is significantly MORE populous than Napa County.


      I''m quite confident that the answer is NO.</think># Is New York County, NY
      less populous than Napa County, CA?


      Let me think about this step by step:


      1) New York County is the official name for Manhattan, one of the five boroughs
      of New York City.

      2) Manhattan is a densely populated urban center in one of America''s largest
      cities.

      3) New York County/Manhattan has a population of approximately 1.6-1.7 million
      people.


      4) Napa County is located in Northern California and is known for its wine country.

      5) Napa County is relatively rural with some small cities and towns.

      6) Napa County has a population of approximately 140,000 people.


      Since New York County (1.6+ million) has a much larger population than Napa

      not less.

      1. First, I need to determine the population of Broward County, Florida.

      2. Then, I need to determine the population of Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania.

      3. Finally, I''ll compare the two populations and determine if Broward County
      is less populous than Philadelphia County.


      For Broward County, FL:

      Broward County is located in southeastern Florida and includes Fort Lauderdale.
      According to recent data, Broward County has a population of approximately 1.9
      million people. To be more precise, based on the 2020 Census, Broward County
      had a population of about 1,944,375.


      For Philadelphia County, PA:

      Philadelphia County is coterminous with the city of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.
      According to recent data, Philadelphia County has a population of approximately
      1.6 million people. Based on the 2020 Census, Philadelphia County had a population
      of about 1,603,797.


      Now, comparing the two:

      - Broward County, FL: ~1,944,375

      - Philadelphia County, PA: ~1,603,797


      Since 1,944,375 > 1,603,797, Broward County is actually MORE populous than Philadelphia
      County, not less.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Broward County, FL less populous than
      Philadelphia County, PA?" is NO.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To answer this question, I need to determine and compare the populations of
      both counties.


      ## Step 1: Determine the population of Broward County, FL

      Broward County is located in southeastern Florida and includes cities like Fort
      Lauderdale. According to recent census data, Broward County has approximately
      1.94 million residents (about 1,944,000 people).


      ## Step 2: Determine the population of Philadelphia County, PA

      Philadelphia County is coterminous with the city of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.
      Based on census data, Philadelphia County has approximately 1.6 million residents
      (about 1,603,000 people).


      ## Step 3: Compare the populations

      - Broward County, FL: ~1.94 million

      - Philadelphia County, PA: ~1.6 million


      Since 1.94 million is greater than 1.6 million, Broward County is actually MORE
      populous than Philadelphia County.

      I need to compare the populations of Broward County, FL and Philadelphia County,

      Let me recall the populations of these counties:


      1. Broward County, FL: Broward County is in southeastern Florida and includes
      Fort Lauderdale. It''s one of the most populous counties in Florida, but I need
      to recall the specific population figure.


      2. Philadelphia County, PA: Philadelphia County is coterminous with the city
      of Philadelphia. It''s the most populous county in Pennsylvania.


      Let me try to recall the approximate populations:


      Broward County, FL: I believe the population is around 1.9-2 million people.

      Philadelphia County, PA: I believe the population is around 1.5-1.6 million
      people.


      Based on my knowledge, I believe Broward County has a larger population than
      Philadelphia County, making it MORE populous, not less populous.


      Let me double-check this reasoning:

      - Broward County is one of the largest counties in Florida, with Fort Lauderdale
      as its county seat, and has approximately 1.9-2 million residents.

      - Philadelphia County is coterminous with the City of Philadelphia and has approximately
      1.5-1.6 million residents.


      So the answer would be "NO" - Broward County, FL is NOT less populous than Philadelphia
      County, PA. Instead, it is MORE populous.


      However, I want to be very careful with this answer since population figures
      can change over time, and my knowledge might not reflect the most recent census
      or population estimates. The last comprehensive US Census was in 2020, and there
      have been population shifts since then. But based on my understanding of the
      relative sizes of these counties, I believe Broward County has a larger population
      than Philadelphia County.

      United States. Cook County is historically one of the most populous counties
      in the US.


      Maricopa County, AZ includes Phoenix, which is also a major US city. This county
      has been growing rapidly in recent decades.


      Based on my knowledge of US demographics:


      Cook County, IL had approximately 5.2 million residents as of recent estimates.

      Maricopa County, AZ had approximately 4.5 million residents, but it has been

      The question asks whether Cook County, IL is less populous than Maricopa County,
      AZ. To answer this, I need to know and compare the populations of both counties.


      Step 1: Recall the population of Cook County, IL.

      Cook County is in Illinois and contains Chicago, which is the third largest
      city in the United States. Cook County is one of the most populous counties
      in the United States. Based on my knowledge, the population of Cook County is
      approximately 5.2 million people as of recent estimates.


      Step 2: Recall the population of Maricopa County, AZ.

      Maricopa County is in Arizona and contains Phoenix, which is the fifth largest
      city in the United States. Maricopa County is also one of the most populous
      counties in the United States. Based on my knowledge, the population of Maricopa
      County is approximately 4.5 million people as of recent estimates.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      Cook County: ~5.2 million people

      Maricopa County: ~4.5 million people


      Based on these estimates, Cook County has a larger population than Maricopa
      County. Therefore, Cook County is NOT less populous than Maricopa County.


      Let me double-check this with more precise figures if I can recall them:


      From my knowledge:

      - Cook County, IL has approximately 5.15-5.2 million residents

      - Maricopa County, AZ has approximately 4.4-4.5 million residents


      These more precise figures confirm my earlier reasoning. Cook County has a larger
      population than Maricopa County.

      1. Cook County, Illinois

      2. Maricopa County, Arizona


      To answer this question correctly, I need to recall the population figures for
      both counties.


      Cook County, IL contains Chicago, which is the third largest city in the United
      States. Cook County is one of the most populous counties in the United States.


      Maricopa County, AZ contains Phoenix, which is a large city but not as large
      as Chicago. However, Maricopa County has been growing rapidly in recent decades.


      Let me recall the approximate populations:


      Cook County, IL: Approximately 5.2 million people (I''m not 100% certain of
      this figure, but I believe it''s in this range)

      Maricopa County, AZ: Approximately 4.5 million people (Again, I''m not 100%
      certain, but I believe it''s in this range)


      If my recollection is correct, Cook County is more populous than Maricopa County.
      Therefore, Cook County is NOT less populous than Maricopa County.


      Let me double-check my reasoning:


      Cook County is home to Chicago and its suburbs, and has historically been one
      of the most populous counties in the US. While Maricopa County (Phoenix area)
      has grown significantly in recent decades, I believe Cook County still has a
      larger population as of the most recent census data I''m familiar with.


      Based on my knowledge, as of the 2020 Census:

      - Cook County had a population of approximately 5.2-5.3 million

      - Maricopa County had a population of approximately 4.4-4.5 million


      So Cook County is MORE populous than Maricopa County, which means Cook County
      is NOT less populous than Maricopa County.


      Wait, let me be even more precise about this. Let me recall the most recent
      census figures I''m aware of:


      According to the 2020 US Census:

      - Cook County, IL had a population of approximately 5.28 million

      - Maricopa County, AZ had a population of approximately 4.42 million


      However, Maricopa County has been growing faster than Cook County in recent
      years. But even with that growth, as of my last update, Cook County still had
      a larger population than Maricopa County.


      Actually, let me reconsider this. Maricopa County has been one of the fastest-growing
      counties in the US. It''s possible that more recent estimates show Maricopa
      County surpassing Cook County in population. Let me think about the most recent
      estimates I''m aware of.


      According to more recent population estimates (post-2020), Maricopa County has
      continued to grow while Cook County may have experienced some population decline.
      This is a trend that has been happening for several years. It''s possible that
      Maricopa County has overtaken Cook County in the very latest population estimates.


      Let me reconsider what I know about the most recent estimates:


      As of my last update, I believe Cook County still had a slightly larger population
      than Maricopa County, but the gap was narrowing. However, I can''t be 100% confident

      Based on the information I''m reasonably confident about (the 2020 Census data),
      Cook County (5.28 million) had a larger population than Maricopa County (4.42
      million). Therefore, Cook County is NOT less populous than Maricopa County.


      So my answer is NO, Cook County is not less populous than Maricopa County, based

      Step 1: Identify what these counties contain.

      Cook County, IL contains Chicago, the third-largest city in the United States.

      Maricopa County, AZ contains Phoenix, the fifth-largest city in the United States.


      Step 2: Recall population figures from recent census data.

      According to the 2020 Census:

      - Cook County, IL had approximately 5.28 million residents

      - Maricopa County, AZ had approximately 4.42 million residents


      Step 3: Consider recent trends.

      While Maricopa County has been growing faster than Cook County in recent years
      (with Cook County actually losing some population), the gap hasn''t closed entirely
      as of the latest reliable data.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Cook County (5.28 million) has more people than Maricopa County (4.42
      million), Cook County is MORE populous than Maricopa County.


      NO, Cook County, IL is not less populous than Maricopa County, AZ.'

      Fairfax County, VA: Approximately 1.1-1.2 million people (as of recent estimates)

      Denver County, CO: Approximately 700,000-750,000 people (as of recent estimates)


      Based on these population figures, Fairfax County has a larger population than
      Denver County.


      So, is Fairfax County, VA less populous than Denver County, CO?


      No, Fairfax County is MORE populous than Denver County, not less populous.

      - Fairfax County has approximately 1.1-1.2 million people

      - Denver County has approximately 700,000-750,000 people

      - 1.1-1.2 million is greater than 700,000-750,000

      San Francisco (San Francisco County):

      My knowledge suggests the population is approximately 850,000-900,000. San Francisco
      is known for being a densely populated city, but its total population is constrained
      by its relatively small land area.


      These figures support my conclusion that Bronx County is MORE populous than

      Sacramento County, CA: According to my knowledge, it had approximately 1.5 million
      residents in recent years.


      These figures confirm my reasoning: Dallas County is more populous than Sacramento
      County, so the answer is NO.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine whether Dallas County, TX is less populous than Sacramento County,
      CA, I need to compare the populations of both counties.


      Step 1: Recall the population of Dallas County, TX.

      Dallas County is one of the largest counties in Texas and includes a significant
      portion of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Based on recent population estimates,
      Dallas County has approximately 2.6 million residents.


      Step 2: Recall the population of Sacramento County, CA.

      Sacramento County contains California''s capital city and surrounding areas.
      Based on recent population estimates, Sacramento County has approximately 1.5
      million residents.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      Dallas County (2.6 million) > Sacramento County (1.5 million)


      Since Dallas County has about 1.1 million more residents than Sacramento County,
      it is actually more populous, not less populous.

      Let me think through this step by step:


      1. First, I need to recall the approximate population of Dallas County, TX.

      2. Then, I need to recall the approximate population of Sacramento County, CA.

      3. Finally, I''ll compare the two populations to determine whether Dallas County
      is less populous than Sacramento County.


      Let''s start with Dallas County, TX:

      Dallas County is one of the most populous counties in Texas and contains the
      city of Dallas, which is one of the largest cities in the United States. Based
      on my knowledge, Dallas County, TX has a population of approximately 2.6 million
      people (as of recent estimates).


      Now for Sacramento County, CA:

      Sacramento County contains the city of Sacramento, which is the capital of California.
      Based on my knowledge, Sacramento County has a population of approximately 1.5
      million people (as of recent estimates).


      Comparing the two:

      Dallas County population: ~2.6 million

      Sacramento County population: ~1.5 million


      Since 2.6 million is greater than 1.5 million, Dallas County is MORE populous
      than Sacramento County, not less populous.


      So the answer to the question "Is Dallas County, TX less populous than Sacramento
      County, CA?" is NO.


      Let me double-check my population estimates to ensure they''re reasonably accurate:


      Dallas County, TX is indeed one of the largest counties in the United States,
      containing the city of Dallas and several suburbs. It typically has a population
      of over 2.5 million.


      Sacramento County, CA contains the city of Sacramento (California''s capital)
      and surrounding areas. It typically has a population of approximately 1.5 million.


      Given these population figures, my conclusion stands: Dallas County is more
      populous than Sacramento County, so the answer is NO.</think># Step-by-Step
      Reasoning


      To answer this question correctly, I need to determine the populations of both
      counties and compare them.


      Step 1: Determine the population of Dallas County, TX.

      Dallas County is one of the most populous counties in Texas and includes the
      city of Dallas. Its population is approximately 2.6 million people.


      Step 2: Determine the population of Sacramento County, CA.

      Sacramento County contains California''s capital city of Sacramento. Its population
      is approximately 1.5 million people.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      - Dallas County: ~2.6 million people

      - Sacramento County: ~1.5 million people


      Since 2.6 million is greater than 1.5 million, Dallas County has MORE people
      than Sacramento County, not less.

      the populations of two US counties: Dallas County, TX and Sacramento County,
      CA.


      To answer this, I need to know the populations of both counties:


      1. Dallas County, TX - This is a major county that contains a large portion
      of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex in Texas.

      2. Sacramento County, CA - This county contains the city of Sacramento, which
      is the capital of California.


      I''ll try to recall the approximate populations of these counties:


      Dallas County, TX is one of the most populous counties in Texas. It contains
      a large part of the Dallas metropolitan area. Based on my knowledge, Dallas
      County has a population of approximately 2.5-2.7 million people.


      Sacramento County, CA contains the city of Sacramento and surrounding areas.
      Its population is approximately 1.5-1.6 million people.


      If my recall is correct, then Dallas County (roughly 2.5-2.7 million) is MORE
      populous than Sacramento County (roughly 1.5-1.6 million).


      Therefore, Dallas County is NOT less populous than Sacramento County.


      Let me double-check this reasoning:

      - Dallas County, TX: ~2.5-2.7 million people

      - Sacramento County, CA: ~1.5-1.6 million people


      Since 2.5-2.7 million is greater than 1.5-1.6 million, Dallas County is MORE
      populous than Sacramento County, not less populous.


      So the answer would be NO, Dallas County, TX is not less populous than Sacramento
      County, CA.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if Dallas County, TX is less populous than Sacramento County, CA,
      I need to recall the approximate populations of both counties.


      ## Population Estimates

      - Dallas County, TX is one of the most populous counties in Texas and includes
      a large portion of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Its population is approximately
      2.6 million people.

      - Sacramento County, CA contains California''s capital city and has a population
      of approximately 1.5 million people.


      ## Comparison

      When comparing these figures:

      2.6 million (Dallas County) > 1.5 million (Sacramento County)


      Therefore, Dallas County has a larger population than Sacramento County, not
      a smaller one.

      I need to compare the populations of Dallas County, Texas and Sacramento County,
      California.


      Step 1: Recall the population of Dallas County, TX.

      Dallas County is one of the most populous counties in Texas and includes the
      city of Dallas. From my knowledge, the population of Dallas County is approximately
      2.6 million people.


      Step 2: Recall the population of Sacramento County, CA.

      Sacramento County includes the city of Sacramento, which is the capital of California.
      From my knowledge, the population of Sacramento County is approximately 1.5
      million people.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      Dallas County: ~2.6 million

      Sacramento County: ~1.5 million


      Since 2.6 million is greater than 1.5 million, Dallas County has a larger population
      than Sacramento County.


      Step 4: Answer the question "Is Dallas County, TX less populous than Sacramento
      County, CA?"

      Since Dallas County has a larger population than Sacramento County, the answer
      is "NO".


      To verify this, let me recall more precise population figures if possible:


      According to my knowledge of recent census data:

      - Dallas County, TX has roughly 2.6-2.7 million residents

      - Sacramento County, CA has roughly 1.5-1.6 million residents


      This confirms my answer: NO, Dallas County is NOT less populous than Sacramento
      County. In fact, it''s significantly more populous.</think># Reasoning Step-by-Step


      To answer this question, I need to compare the populations of Dallas County,
      TX and Sacramento County, CA.


      Step 1: Determine the population of Dallas County, TX.

      Dallas County is one of the most populous counties in Texas, containing much
      of the city of Dallas. Based on recent census data, Dallas County has approximately
      2.6 million residents.


      Step 2: Determine the population of Sacramento County, CA.

      Sacramento County contains California''s capital city. Its population is approximately
      1.5 million residents.


      Step 3: Compare the two populations.

      Dallas County (2.6 million) > Sacramento County (1.5 million)


      Since Dallas County has a larger population than Sacramento County (about 1.1
      million more people), it is not less populous.

      To determine if Queens County, NY is less populous than Fulton County, GA, I
      need to compare their populations.


      1) Queens County, NY is one of the five boroughs of New York City. As of recent
      census data, Queens County has approximately 2.3 million residents.


      2) Fulton County, GA contains a large portion of Atlanta (Georgia''s capital
      and largest city). Its population is approximately 1.1 million residents.


      3) Comparing these figures: Queens County (2.3 million) vs. Fulton County (1.1
      million)


      4) Since 2.3 million is greater than 1.1 million, Queens County has a larger
      population than Fulton County.

    a4d5ead2-7b36-4f50-917b-7550b675857a: '<think>Let me think about this step by
      step:


      1) First, I need to determine the population of King County, Washington.

      2) Then, I need to determine the population of the District of Columbia (DC).

      3) Finally, I''ll compare the two populations and answer whether King County,
      WA is less populous than DC.


      Let me work through this:


      King County, Washington is the county that includes Seattle, the largest city
      in Washington state. As of recent population estimates (based on my knowledge),
      King County has over 2 million residents. More specifically, according to the
      2020 Census, King County''s population was approximately 2.25-2.3 million people.


      The District of Columbia (Washington, DC) is not a county but rather a federal
      district that functions somewhat similarly to a city-county. According to recent
      data, DC''s population is around 700,000-750,000 people. The 2020 Census put
      DC''s population at approximately 690,000 people.


      Given these population figures:

      - King County, WA: ~2.25-2.3 million

      - District of Columbia: ~690,000-750,000


      King County is significantly more populous than the District of Columbia. King
      County has roughly three times the population of DC.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, King County, WA is NOT less populous than the District
      of Columbia, DC. In fact, it''s the opposite - King County is more populous
      than DC.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To answer this question, I need to find and compare the populations of King
      County, WA and the District of Columbia, DC.


      Step 1: Determine the population of King County, Washington.

      King County is the most populous county in Washington state and includes Seattle.
      According to the 2020 Census, King County has approximately 2.3 million residents.


      Step 2: Determine the population of the District of Columbia.

      The District of Columbia (Washington, DC) is a federal district that functions
      similarly to a city-county. According to the 2020 Census, DC has approximately
      690,000 residents.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      King County: ~2.3 million people

      District of Columbia: ~690,000 people


      King County has more than three times the population of DC.
