      \ question step by step. The question is: **\"Is Orange County, CA less populous\
      \ than Richmond County, NY?\"** To answer this, I need to find the population\
      \ figures for both Orange County, California, and Richmond County, New York.\
      \ Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Counties\n\nFirst,\
      \ I need to confirm the locations and ensure I'm looking at the correct counties.\n\
      \n- **Orange County, CA**: This is located in Southern California, known for\
      \ cities like Anaheim, Santa Ana, and Irvine.\n  \n- **Richmond County, NY**:\
      \ This is actually another name for **Staten Island**, which is one of the five\
      \ boroughs of New York City.\n\n### Step 2: Find Population Data\n\nNext, I\
      \ need to find the most recent population data for both counties. Since population\
      \ numbers can change, I'll look for the latest available figures.\n\n#### Orange\
      \ County, CA Population\n\nAs of the latest data (around 2020 Census estimates),\
      \ Orange County, CA has a population of approximately **3.2 million** people.\n\
      \n#### Richmond County, NY (Staten Island) Population\n\nSimilarly, Richmond\
      \ County, NY, which is Staten Island, has a population of about **475,000**\
      \ people according to the same 2020 Census estimates.\n\n### Step 3: Compare\
      \ the Populations\n\nNow that I have the population figures:\n\n- **Orange County,\
      \ CA**: ~3.2 million\n- **Richmond County, NY**: ~475,000\n\nClearly, **Orange\
      \ County, CA** has a significantly larger population than **Richmond County,\
      \ NY**.\n\n### Step 4: Address the Original Question\n\nThe original question\
      \ asks: **\"Is Orange County, CA less populous than Richmond County, NY?\"**\n\
      \nBased on the population figures:\n\n- Orange County, CA: ~3.2 million\n- Richmond\
      \ County, NY: ~475,000\n\n**Orange County, CA** is **not** less populous than\
      \ **Richmond County, NY**; in fact, it's much more populous.\n\n### Conclusion\n\

      1. **Broward County, FL**: According to the most recent U.S. Census data, Broward
      County has a population of approximately 1.96 million people.

      2. **Philadelphia County, PA**: Philadelphia County, which is coterminous with

      Now, let''s compare the two:

      - Broward County, FL: ~1.96 million

      - Philadelphia County, PA: ~1.58 million


      Since 1.96 million (Broward County) is greater than 1.58 million (Philadelphia

      question step by step to determine whether Fairfax County, VA is less populous
      than Denver County, CO.


      ### Step 1: Understand the Question

      We need to compare the population of Fairfax County in Virginia with that of
      Denver County in Colorado. Specifically, we''re asked if Fairfax County has
      fewer people than Denver County.


      ### Step 2: Identify the Counties

      - **Fairfax County, VA**: Located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, it''s part
      of the Washington metropolitan area.

      - **Denver County, CO**: Located in the state of Colorado, it''s the capital
      city of Colorado and also the county seat.


      ### Step 3: Find Population Data

      To compare the populations, we''ll need the most recent population figures for
      both counties. As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, here are the approximate
      populations:


      - **Fairfax County, VA**: Approximately 1.15 million residents.

      - **Denver County, CO**: Approximately 715,000 residents.


      ### Step 4: Compare the Populations

      Now, let''s compare the two numbers:


      - Fairfax County: 1,150,000

      - Denver County: 715,000


      Clearly, Fairfax County has a higher population than Denver County.


      ### Step 5: Answer the Question

      The question asks if Fairfax County, VA is **less populous** than Denver County,
      CO. Based on the population figures:


      **NO**, Fairfax County, VA is **not** less populous than Denver County, CO;
      in fact, it has a higher population.
