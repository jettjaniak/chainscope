      we need to compare the population of King County, WA, with that of the District
      of Columbia, DC. Here are the steps:


      1. **Identify the Population of King County, WA**: As of the 2020 United States
      Census, King County, Washington, has a population of approximately 2,269,675.


      2. **Identify the Population of District of Columbia, DC**: As of the 2020 United
      States Census, the District of Columbia has a population of approximately 689,545.


      3. **Compare the Populations**: Now, we compare the two populations to determine
      which is larger. King County, WA, has a population of about 2,269,675, while
