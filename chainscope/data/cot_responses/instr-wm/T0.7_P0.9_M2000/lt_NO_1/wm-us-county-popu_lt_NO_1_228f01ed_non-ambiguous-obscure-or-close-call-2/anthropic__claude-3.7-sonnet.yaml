      the populations of Queens County, NY and Fulton County, GA.


      Step 1: Recall the population of Queens County, NY.

      Queens County is one of the five boroughs of New York City and is quite populous.
      Its population is approximately 2.2-2.3 million people.


      Step 2: Recall the population of Fulton County, GA.

      Fulton County is where Atlanta (Georgia''s largest city) is located. Its population
      is approximately 1.0-1.1 million people.


      Step 3: Compare the two populations.

      Queens County (2.2-2.3 million) has a significantly larger population than Fulton
      County (1.0-1.1 million).


      Therefore, Queens County, NY is NOT less populous than Fulton County, GA. Queens
      County has roughly twice the population of Fulton County.
