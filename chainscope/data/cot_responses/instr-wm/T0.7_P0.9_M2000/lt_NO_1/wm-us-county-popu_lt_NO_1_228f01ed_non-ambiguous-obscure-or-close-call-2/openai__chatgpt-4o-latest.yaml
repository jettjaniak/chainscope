      the Bronx in New York City. San Francisco County, CA is also coterminous with
      the City of San Francisco. So we are comparing two urban counties that are also
      cities.

      According to the U.S. Census Bureau estimates:


      - Bronx County, NY had a population of approximately 1.4 million people as of
      the 2020 Census, and remains around that number in recent estimates.

      - San Francisco County, CA had a population of approximately 815,000 as of the
      2020 Census, with slight fluctuations in recent years.


      Step 3: Compare the numbers.


      - 1.4 million (Bronx) is greater than 815,000 (San Francisco).


      Conclusion: Bronx County is more populous than San Francisco County.

      \ we are treating it like a county-level entity.\n   - The population of Washington,\
      \ DC is approximately 700,000 to 720,000 based on recent estimates.\n\n3. **Compare\
