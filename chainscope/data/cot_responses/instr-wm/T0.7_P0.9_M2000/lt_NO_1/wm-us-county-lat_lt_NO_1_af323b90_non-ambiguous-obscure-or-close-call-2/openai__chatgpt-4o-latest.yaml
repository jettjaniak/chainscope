      \ part of Illinois.\n   - Harris County is in the state of Texas. It includes\
      \ the city of Houston, which is in the southeastern part of Texas.\n\n2. **Determine\
      \ the relative latitude (north-south position):**\n   - Chicago (Cook County)\
      \ is located at approximately 41.88\xB0 N latitude.\n   - Houston (Harris County)\
      \ is located at approximately 29.76\xB0 N latitude.\n\n3. **Compare the latitudes:**\n\
      \   - Since 41.88\xB0 N (Cook County) is a higher latitude than 29.76\xB0 N\
      \ (Harris County), Cook County is farther north than Harris County.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ Cook County, IL is located **north** of Harris County, TX.\n\n**Answer: NO**."
    cc9994b4-6373-4325-86d6-feb4609a5ea8: "To determine whether Cook County, IL is\
      \ located south of Harris County, TX, we need to consider their geographic locations\
      \ in terms of latitude.\n\n1. **Cook County, Illinois** contains the city of\
      \ Chicago and is located in the northeastern part of Illinois, near Lake Michigan.\n\
      \   - The approximate latitude of Chicago (and thus Cook County) is about **41.88\xB0\
      \ N**.\n\n2. **Harris County, Texas** contains the city of Houston and is located\
      \ in southeastern Texas, near the Gulf of Mexico.\n   - The approximate latitude\
      \ of Houston (and thus Harris County) is about **29.76\xB0 N**.\n\n3. In the\
      \ Northern Hemisphere, locations with a **lower latitude number** are farther\
      \ south.\n\n4. Comparing the two:\n   - Cook County: ~41.88\xB0 N\n   - Harris\
      \ County: ~29.76\xB0 N\n\nSince 29.76 is less than 41.88, Harris County is farther\
