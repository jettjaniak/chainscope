      \ County, NY is located south of Palm Beach County, FL, we need to consider\
      \ the geographical locations of both counties. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\
      \n1. **Identify the states**: New York County, NY, is located in the state of\
      \ New York, and Palm Beach County, FL, is located in the state of Florida.\n\
      \n2. **General geographical knowledge**: New York is generally located in the\

      \ higher the latitude, the more north a location is, and the lower the latitude,\
      \ the more south.\n\n4. **Specific locations**:\n   - New York County, NY, is\
