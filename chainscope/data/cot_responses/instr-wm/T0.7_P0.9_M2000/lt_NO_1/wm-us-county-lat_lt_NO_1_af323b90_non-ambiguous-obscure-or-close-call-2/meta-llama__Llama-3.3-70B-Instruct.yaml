      1. **Identify the states**: King County is located in the state of Washington
      (WA), and Maricopa County is located in the state of Arizona (AZ).


      2. **General geographical knowledge of the US**: Washington state is in the

      3. **Compare latitudes**: Generally, the further north a location is, the higher

      This means that any point in Washington, including King County, would be north
      of any point in Arizona, including Maricopa County.

    cc2ae18a-aaa6-46ee-b35b-4dae3068a95e: 'To determine if Cook County,
      IL is located south of Harris County, TX, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Cook County is in Illinois, and Harris County
      is in Texas.

      2. **Determine the general geographic positions of Illinois and Texas**: Illinois
      is located in the northern part of the United States, often considered part
      of the Midwest. Texas is located in the southern part of the United States.

      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Since Illinois is generally north of Texas, we
      can infer that Cook County, IL is likely at a higher latitude (further north)
      than Harris County, TX.

      4. **Conclusion based on geographic principles**: Given that north is the opposite
      direction of south, if Cook County, IL is north of Harris County, TX, it cannot
      be south of it.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Cook County, IL is located south
      of Harris County, TX is: NO'
