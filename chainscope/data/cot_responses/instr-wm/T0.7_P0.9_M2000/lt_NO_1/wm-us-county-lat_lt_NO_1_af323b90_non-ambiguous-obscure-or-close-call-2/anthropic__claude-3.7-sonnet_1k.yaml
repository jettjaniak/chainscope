      to determine the geographical locations of Nassau County, NY and Broward County,
      FL, and specifically compare their north-south positions.


      Step 1: Identify where Nassau County, NY is located.

      Nassau County is located on Long Island in the state of New York, which is in
      the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Identify where Broward County, FL is located.

      Broward County is located in southeastern Florida, with Fort Lauderdale as its
      county seat.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes (north-south positions).

      New York is much further north than Florida in the United States. New York is
      in the northern part of the country, while Florida is the southernmost state
      in the continental United States.


      Since Nassau County is in New York, and Broward County is in Florida, Nassau
      County must be north of Broward County, not south of it.</think>I need to determine
      the relative north-south positions of these two counties.


      Step 1: Locate Nassau County, NY.

      Nassau County is located on Long Island in New York state, in the northeastern
      United States.


      Step 2: Locate Broward County, FL.

      Broward County is located in southeastern Florida (home to Fort Lauderdale),
      in the southern part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      New York is much further north than Florida. Florida is actually one of the
      southernmost states in the continental US, while New York is in the northern
      portion of the country.


      Therefore, Nassau County, NY is located NORTH of Broward County, FL - not south

      compare their geographic positions, specifically whether Queens County is south
      of Orleans Parish.


      Queens County is one of the five boroughs of New York City, located in the southeastern
      part of New York state. New York is in the northeastern United States.


      Orleans Parish is a parish (equivalent to a county) in Louisiana. It contains
      the city of New Orleans. Louisiana is in the southern United States, along the
      Gulf of Mexico.


      In terms of latitude, southern locations have lower latitude values than northern
      locations. So I need to determine if Queens County, NY has a lower latitude
      than Orleans Parish, LA.


      New York is significantly north of Louisiana. New York is in the northeast US,
      while Louisiana is in the deep south. Orleans Parish, being in Louisiana, is
      much further south than Queens County, which is in New York.

      Queens County is one of the five boroughs of New York City, located in the southeastern
      part of New York State in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Identify where Orleans Parish, LA is located.

      Orleans Parish contains the city of New Orleans and is located in southeastern
      Louisiana in the southern United States along the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      New York is in the northeastern United States, which is significantly north
      of Louisiana, which is in the deep south. In terms of latitude, southern locations
      have lower latitude values than northern locations.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Louisiana is much further south than New York, Orleans Parish is south
      of Queens County, not the other way around.
