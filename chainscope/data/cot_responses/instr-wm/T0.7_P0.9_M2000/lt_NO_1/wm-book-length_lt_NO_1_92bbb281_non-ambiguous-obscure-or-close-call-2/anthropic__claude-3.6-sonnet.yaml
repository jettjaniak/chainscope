      1. First, let me recall the details about both books:

      - "Love Story" by Erich Segal is a novel published in 1970

      - "Pat the Bunny" by Dorothy Kunhardt is a children''s interactive board book


      2. Looking at their typical lengths:

      - "Love Story" is typically around 130-140 pages

      - "Pat the Bunny" is a very short children''s book, typically around 12-20 pages


      3. Comparing the numbers:
