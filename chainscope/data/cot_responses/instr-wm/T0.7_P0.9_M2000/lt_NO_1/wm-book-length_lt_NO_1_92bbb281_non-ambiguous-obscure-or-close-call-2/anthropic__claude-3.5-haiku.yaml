    f6bd4196-346b-4b9d-b870-d6b9fea71bfe: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll find the page count for The Return of the King:

      - The Return of the King is typically around 380-416 pages, depending on the
      edition

      - It''s the third book in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, which is a lengthy
      novel


      2. Next, I''ll find the page count for Carrie:

      - Carrie is Stephen King''s first published novel

      - It''s generally around 200-250 pages, much shorter than Tolkien''s work


      3. Comparing the page counts:

      - The Return of the King: ~380-416 pages

      - Carrie: ~200-250 pages

      - The Return of the King has MORE pages than Carrie


      4. Therefore, the answer to the question "Does J. R. R. Tolkien''s The Return
      of the King have fewer pages than Stephen King''s Carrie?" is:


      NO'
