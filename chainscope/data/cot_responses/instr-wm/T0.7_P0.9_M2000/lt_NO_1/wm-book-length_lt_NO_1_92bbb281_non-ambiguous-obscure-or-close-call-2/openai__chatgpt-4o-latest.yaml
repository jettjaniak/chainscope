      step.


      Step 1: Identify the two books and their respective authors.

      - "It" by Stephen King

      - "Heaven is for Real" by Lynn Vincent (co-authored with Todd Burpo)


      Step 2: Determine the approximate page count of each book.


      - Stephen King''s "It" is known to be a very long novel. The page count can
      vary by edition, but typically it has over 1,000 pages. For example, the 2017
      Scribner paperback edition has around 1,160 pages.


      - "Heaven is for Real" is a much shorter nonfiction book. Most editions have
      around 160-210 pages. For example, the Thomas Nelson hardcover edition has about
      192 pages.


      Step 3: Compare the two page counts.

      - "It": ~1,160 pages

      - "Heaven is for Real": ~192 pages


      Clearly, "It" has significantly more pages than "Heaven is for Real."

      the number of pages in two books:


      1. **Roots: The Saga of an American Family** by Alex Haley

      2. **Shoe Dog** by Phil Knight


      Let''s go step by step:


      **Step 1: Find the number of pages in Alex Haley''s Roots.**

      - The original edition of "Roots" by Alex Haley typically has around 700 to
      900 pages, depending on the publisher and format. A commonly cited version (such
      as the paperback edition) has approximately 888 pages.


      **Step 2: Find the number of pages in Phil Knight''s Shoe Dog.**

      - "Shoe Dog" by Phil Knight generally has fewer pages. The standard hardcover
      edition has around 383 pages.


      **Step 3: Compare the number of pages.**

      - Roots: ~888 pages

      - Shoe Dog: ~383 pages


      Since 888 is greater than 383, Roots has more pages than Shoe Dog.

      1. Identify the approximate page count of *Roots*.

      2. Identify the approximate page count of *Shoe Dog*.

      3. Compare the two numbers.


      Step 1: *Roots: The Saga of an American Family* by Alex Haley is a lengthy historical
      novel. The standard editions typically have around 700 to 800 pages. For example,
      the 2007 edition has approximately 888 pages.

    8bafcd84-011b-43b3-b95d-b203650414ed: 'To determine whether Robert Jordan''s *The
      Shadow Rising* has fewer pages than Truman Capote''s *In Cold Blood*, we need
      to compare the typical page counts of both books.


      Step 1: Understand the books in question.


      - *The Shadow Rising* is the fourth book in the *Wheel of Time* series by Robert
      Jordan. It is known to be one of the longer books in the series.

      - *In Cold Blood* by Truman Capote is a nonfiction novel that is typically shorter
      than most epic fantasy novels such as those in the *Wheel of Time* series.


      Step 2: Estimate or find typical page counts.


      - *The Shadow Rising* often has around 980 to 1,000 pages, depending on the
      edition.

      - *In Cold Blood* usually has around 340 to 360 pages, again depending on the
      edition.


      Step 3: Compare the numbers.


      - 980 (Shadow Rising) vs. 360 (In Cold Blood)


      Since 980 is greater than 360, *The Shadow Rising* has more pages than *In Cold
      Blood*.
