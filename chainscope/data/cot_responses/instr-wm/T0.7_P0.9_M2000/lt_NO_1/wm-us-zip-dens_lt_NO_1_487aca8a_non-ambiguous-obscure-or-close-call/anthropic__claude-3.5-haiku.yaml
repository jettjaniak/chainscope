      1. First, 10025 and 10019 are both zip codes in New York City, specifically
      in Manhattan.


      2. 10025 corresponds to the Upper West Side neighborhood, roughly around 96th
      to 110th Street between Central Park West and Riverside Drive.


      3. 10019 corresponds to the area around Columbus Circle and parts of Midtown
      West.


      4. The Upper West Side (10025) is primarily a residential neighborhood with
      many apartment buildings, brownstones, and some larger residential complexes.


      5. The 10019 zip code includes parts of Midtown West, which has a mix of residential
      buildings, commercial spaces, offices, and entertainment venues like Carnegie
      Hall.


      6. Midtown areas tend to have more daytime population density due to offices
      and commercial activities, but fewer permanent residents compared to residential
      neighborhoods.


      7. The Upper West Side (10025) is known for having a high concentration of permanent
      residents in a relatively compact area.


      8. Therefore, the 10019 area is likely less densely populated in terms of permanent
      residents.

      1. 10014 is a zip code in New York City, specifically in Manhattan''s West Village
      neighborhood.


      2. 94301 is a zip code in Palo Alto, California, which is in the San Francisco
      Bay Area.


      3. Manhattan is known for being extremely densely populated, with high-rise
      buildings and very compact urban living.


      4. Palo Alto, while in a tech-dense area, has more spread-out residential neighborhoods
      with lower building heights.


      5. The West Village (10014) is particularly dense, with many apartment buildings
      and little open space.


      6. Palo Alto (94301) has more single-family homes, wider streets, and more green
      space between buildings.


      7. Therefore, 10014 is almost certainly more densely populated than 94301.

      - While the Strip is very developed, it has large casino complexes with open
      spaces between buildings

      - The surrounding area is in a desert environment with relatively sparse population


      3. Comparing population density:

      - Manhattan''s 10036 has extremely high population density (likely over 70,000
      people per square mile)

      - Las Vegas''s 89109, while busy, has significantly lower population density

      - The urban design and geography of Manhattan inherently supports much higher
      density than Las Vegas


      4. Conclusion:

      - 10036 (Manhattan) is MUCH more densely populated than 89109 (Las Vegas Strip)


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, 10036, NY is NOT less densely populated than 89109,
      NV.'

      1. 10036 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York City

      - Manhattan is one of the most densely populated areas in the United States

      - This zip code covers part of Midtown Manhattan, which is extremely dense with
      high-rise buildings and offices


      2. 89109 is a zip code in Las Vegas, Nevada

      - This zip code covers part of the Las Vegas Strip

      - While the Strip is densely developed, it''s not a residential area like Manhattan

      - Las Vegas overall has much lower population density compared to Manhattan


      3. Comparing population density:

      - Manhattan has around 70,000 people per square mile

      - Las Vegas has around 4,300 people per square mile

      - The specific zip codes follow this broader trend


      4. Therefore, 10036 (NY) is significantly MORE densely populated than 89109
      (NV)


      Since the question asks if 10036 is LESS densely populated, the answer is:


      NO'

      - Manhattan is one of the most densely populated areas in the United States

      - It''s an urban center with many high-rise buildings and a very high population
      density


      2. 02554 is a zip code for Falmouth, Massachusetts

      - Falmouth is located on Cape Cod

      1. First, 10012 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York City

      - Manhattan is extremely densely populated

      - This zip code is in Greenwich Village/SoHo area, which is a very dense urban
      neighborhood


      2. 90069 is a zip code in West Hollywood, California

      - West Hollywood is also urban, but less densely populated than Manhattan

      - This area has more spread-out residential spaces compared to Manhattan''s
      compact living


      3. Manhattan (where 10012 is located) is known for:

      - High-rise apartment buildings

      - Very compact living arrangements

      - Extremely high population density

      - Minimal open space


      4. West Hollywood (where 90069 is located) has:

      - More spread-out housing

      - More single-family homes and smaller apartment complexes

      - Less vertical density compared to Manhattan


      5. Comparing the two, Manhattan''s 10012 is significantly more densely populated
