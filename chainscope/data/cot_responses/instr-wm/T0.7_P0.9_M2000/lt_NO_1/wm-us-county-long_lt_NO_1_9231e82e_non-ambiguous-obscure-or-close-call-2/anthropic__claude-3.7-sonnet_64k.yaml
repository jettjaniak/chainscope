      2. This requires knowing the geographical locations of both counties.


      First, let''s think about where these counties are located:


      * New York County, NY is the primary county of New York City, located on the
      East Coast of the United States. It''s in the eastern part of the country.

      * Orange County, CA is in California, which is on the West Coast of the United

      - New York is on the Atlantic (eastern) side of the country

      - California is on the Pacific (western) side of the country

      - Therefore, California is west of New York, not the other way around


      ## Step 3: Make the determination

      - Since Orange County is in California (west), and New York County is in New
      York (east), New York County is NOT west of Orange County

      York City.


      Orange County, CA is in the state of California, which is on the West Coast
      of the United States.


      The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the
      Pacific Ocean on the west. States on the East Coast (like New York) are east
      of states on the West Coast (like California).


      Therefore, New York County, NY is located east of Orange County, CA, not west.


      So, the answer is NO, New York County, NY is not located west of Orange County,
      CA.</think>I need to determine the relative geographic positions of New York
      County, NY and Orange County, CA.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - New York County is in the state of New York, which is on the East Coast of
      the United States. New York County is specifically Manhattan in New York City.

      - Orange County is in the state of California, which is on the West Coast of
      the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on a west-east axis.

      - The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic
      Ocean (east).

      - California is on the western edge of the continental US, bordering the Pacific
      Ocean.

      - New York is on the eastern edge of the continental US, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.


      Step 3: Make the determination.

      - Since California is on the West Coast and New York is on the East Coast, California
      is west of New York.

      - Therefore, Orange County, CA is west of New York County, NY, not the other
      way around.

      NY is located west of San Diego County, CA.


      Step 1: Let me recall the location of Queens County, NY.

      Queens County is one of the five boroughs of New York City, located on the eastern
      part of Long Island in the state of New York. New York is on the East Coast
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Let me recall the location of San Diego County, CA.

      San Diego County is located in the southwestern corner of California. California
      is on the West Coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare the relative east-west positions.

      In the United States, locations on the East Coast (like New York) are east of
      locations on the West Coast (like California). That means that Queens County,
      NY is east of San Diego County, CA, not west of it.


      So, Queens County, NY is NOT located west of San Diego County, CA. It''s actually
      east of it.


      The answer is NO.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Queens County is one of the five boroughs of New York City, located in the
      state of New York on the East Coast of the United States.

      - San Diego County is located in the southwestern corner of California on the
      West Coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on the east-west axis.

      - The United States generally spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west).

      - New York is on the East Coast, while California is on the West Coast.

      - This means that New York locations (including Queens County) are east of California
      locations (including San Diego County).


      Step 3: Reach a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since Queens County, NY is on the East Coast and San Diego County, CA is on
      the West Coast, Queens County is located east (not west) of San Diego County.


      NO'

      Let me reason through this geographically:


      1. Queens County is one of the five boroughs of New York City, located in the
      state of New York, which is on the east coast of the United States.


      2. San Diego County is located in the state of California, which is on the west

      York state on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      - San Diego County is located in southern California on the western coast of
      the United States.


      Step 2: Consider continental geography.

      - The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west).

      - New York is on the Atlantic (east) side of the country.

      - California is on the Pacific (west) side of the country.


      Step 3: Compare longitudinal positions.

      - Moving from east to west across the US, you would go from New York to California,
      not the other way around.

      - Therefore, Queens County must be east of San Diego County, not west of it.

    f8b61257-e2b8-47aa-ac4e-5c89cd3e8030: '<think>Let me solve this step by step.


      1. First, I need to identify where Cook County, IL and King County, WA are located.


      Cook County, IL is the county that contains Chicago, Illinois. Illinois is in
      the Midwest region of the United States.


      King County, WA is the county that contains Seattle, Washington. Washington
      state is in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, on the west coast.


      2. Now I need to determine which is more westerly (which has the more westerly
      longitude).


      The United States generally spans from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the
      Pacific Ocean in the west. Washington state borders the Pacific Ocean, which
      puts it on the western edge of the contiguous United States. Illinois is in
      the Midwest, which is east of the western states like Washington.


      3. To be more precise:

      - Washington state is one of the westernmost states in the continental US

      - Illinois is much further east, in the Midwest region


      4. So King County, WA would be west of Cook County, IL.


      5. The question asks if Cook County, IL is west of King County, WA. The answer
      is no - it''s the opposite. Cook County is EAST of King County.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative positions of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Cook County, IL contains Chicago and is located in northeastern Illinois.

      - King County, WA contains Seattle and is located in western Washington state.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Illinois and Washington state.

      - Washington state is on the Pacific coast in the northwestern United States.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region, significantly east of Washington.


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Washington state is one of the westernmost states in the contiguous United
      States.

      - Illinois is much further east, roughly in the middle of the country.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion about the specific counties.

      - Since King County is in western Washington, and Cook County is in Illinois,
      King County must be west of Cook County.

      Ocean (west), and:

      - Palm Beach County is on the Atlantic (east) side

      - Napa County is on the Pacific (west) side


      Palm Beach County, FL would be EAST of Napa County, CA, not west.

      Step 2: Compare their positions on the east-west axis.

      - Florida is on the east coast of the United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific
      Ocean.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positioning.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, California is significantly west
      of Florida.

      - Therefore, Palm Beach County (in Florida) is east of Napa County (in California),
      not west of it.

      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1. Palm Beach County is in Florida (FL), which is a state on the southeastern
      coast of the United States.

      2. Napa County is in California (CA), which is a state on the western coast
      of the United States.

      3. Generally, the United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to
      the Pacific Ocean on the west.

      4. Florida is on the eastern side of the country, bordering the Atlantic Ocean.

      5. California is on the western side of the country, bordering the Pacific Ocean.

      6. When we say something is "west" of something else in the US, we typically
      mean it''s closer to the Pacific Ocean, while "east" means closer to the Atlantic
      Ocean.


      Given this information, Palm Beach County, FL is on the eastern side of the
      United States, while Napa County, CA is on the western side. Therefore, Palm

      Pacific Ocean (west).

      - Florida is in the southeastern part of the country.

      - California is in the western part of the country, bordering the Pacific Ocean.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      - Moving from east to west across the United States, you would go from Florida
      toward California.

      - Therefore, Palm Beach County (FL) is east of Napa County (CA), not west of
      it.

      part of the United States.

      - Sacramento County is in the state of California (CA), which is on the west
      coast of the United States.


      The United States generally has states ordered from west to east, with the west
      coast (including California) being the westernmost part of the contiguous United
      States, and the east coast (including states like Georgia) being the easternmost
      part.


      Since California is on the west coast and Georgia is in the southeast, California
      is generally west of Georgia. This means that Sacramento County, CA would be
      west of Fulton County, GA - not the other way around.


      So, the question asks if Fulton County, GA is located west of Sacramento County,

      First, let''s identify where these counties are:

      - Fulton County, GA: This is a county in the state of Georgia (GA), which is
      in the eastern part of the United States.

      - Sacramento County, CA: This is a county in the state of California (CA), which
      is on the west coast of the United States.


      Generally speaking:

      - Georgia is in the eastern United States

      - California is in the western United States


      Since California is on the west coast of the United States and Georgia is in
      the eastern part of the country, Sacramento County, CA would be west of Fulton

      To think about this in terms of longitude (east-west position):

      - Areas in the western US have lower (more negative) longitude values

      - Areas in the eastern US have higher (less negative or positive) longitude
      values


      Since Sacramento County, CA is in the western US and Fulton County, GA is in
      the eastern US, Sacramento County has a lower longitude value than Fulton County,
      meaning it is west of Fulton County.

      First, I need to determine the locations of both counties:


      1. Nassau County, NY is located on Long Island in the state of New York, which
      is on the East Coast of the United States.


      2. Los Angeles County, CA is located on the West Coast of the United States
      in the state of California.


      Now I need to determine which one is farther west. In the United States, the
      western areas have higher longitude values (when using negative values for western
      hemisphere longitudes, they have smaller absolute values than eastern areas).


      The East Coast, where Nassau County is located, is definitely east of the West
      Coast, where Los Angeles County is located. This means that Nassau County is
      east of Los Angeles County, not west of it.


      So, to answer the question "Is Nassau County, NY located west of Los Angeles
      County, CA?", the answer is NO. Nassau County is located east of Los Angeles
      County.</think># Is Nassau County, NY located west of Los Angeles County, CA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two counties on a map of
      the United States.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Nassau County is located on Long Island in New York state on the East Coast
      of the United States

      - Los Angeles County is located in California on the West Coast of the United
      States


      ## Step 2: Compare their positions

      The continental United States spans from east to west, with the East Coast (including
      New York) being on the eastern side and the West Coast (including California)
      being on the western side.


      ## Step 3: Determine relative position

      Since Nassau County is on the East Coast and Los Angeles County is on the West
      Coast, Nassau County is located EAST of Los Angeles County, not west.


      NO'

      1. I need to determine the relative positions of Nassau County, NY and Los Angeles
      County, CA.


      2. Nassau County is located in New York state, on Long Island, east of New York
      City. New York is on the east coast of the United States.


      3. Los Angeles County is located in California, on the west coast of the United
      States.


      4. The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to
      the Pacific Ocean on the west.


      5. Generally speaking, locations in New York are east of locations in California,
      because New York is on the east coast and California is on the west coast.


      6. Therefore, Nassau County, NY, being on the east coast, would be east of Los
      Angeles County, CA, which is on the west coast.


      7. The question asks if Nassau County is located west of Los Angeles County.
      Since Nassau County is east of Los Angeles County, not west, the answer would
      be NO.


      So the answer is NO, Nassau County, NY is not located west of Los Angeles County,
      CA. It is located east of Los Angeles County.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two counties.

      - Nassau County is located in New York state, on Long Island, on the east coast
      of the United States.

      - Los Angeles County is located in California, on the west coast of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the
      Pacific Ocean (west).

      - New York is on the east coast, while California is on the west coast.

      - Therefore, locations in New York are generally east of locations in California.


      Step 3: Make the final determination.

      - Since Nassau County, NY is on the east coast and Los Angeles County, CA is
      on the west coast, Nassau County is located east of Los Angeles County, not
      west of it.

      coast of the United States.

      2. Los Angeles County is located in the state of California (CA), which is on
      the west coast of the United States.

      3. Generally speaking, locations in New York are east of locations in California,
      because the United States extends from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west), with New York near the Atlantic and California near the Pacific.


      To answer the specific question about whether Nassau County, NY is west of Los
      Angeles County, CA:

      - West means toward or at the west (the direction of the setting sun).

      - If we go from east to west across the United States, we''d go from the east

      because the continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to
      the Pacific Ocean (west).


      To be more specific:

      - Broward County is in southeastern Florida, containing Fort Lauderdale

      - Santa Clara County is in northern California, containing San Jose and part
      of Silicon Valley


      Since California is on the west coast and Florida is on the east coast, Broward
      County (FL) is located EAST of Santa Clara County (CA), not west.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Broward County, FL is NOT located west of Santa
      Clara County, CA. It is located EAST of Santa Clara County, CA.</think># Step-by-Step
      Reasoning


      First, I need to identify the locations of both counties:

      - Broward County is in Florida (FL)

      - Santa Clara County is in California (CA)


      Next, I need to determine their relative positions on the east-west axis:

      - Florida is located on the east coast of the United States

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States


      Since the continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the
      Atlantic Ocean (east), and California borders the Pacific while Florida borders
      the Atlantic:

      - All of Florida, including Broward County, is east of California

      - All of California, including Santa Clara County, is west of Florida


      Therefore, Broward County, FL is located EAST of Santa Clara County, CA, not
      west of it.

      step.


      The question is: Is Broward County, FL located west of Santa Clara County, CA?


      First, I need to determine the general locations of these counties:


      1. Broward County, FL: Broward County is in Florida, which is in the southeastern
      United States. Florida extends along the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast of
      the US.


      2. Santa Clara County, CA: Santa Clara County is in California, which is on
      the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific Ocean.


      Now, to determine which is more westerly, I need to think about the relative
      positions of Florida and California in the United States:


      - California is the westernmost contiguous state in the US, located on the Pacific
      coast.

      - Florida is in the southeastern US, with its eastern border on the Atlantic
      Ocean.


      When we think about east-west positioning in the US, the general pattern is:

      - West Coast (Pacific Ocean) - including California

      - Mountain West

      - Great Plains

      - Midwest

      - South/Southeast - including Florida

      - East Coast (Atlantic Ocean)


      California is significantly west of Florida on a map of the United States. Since
      Broward County is in Florida and Santa Clara County is in California, it follows
      that Santa Clara County is west of Broward County.


      Therefore, Broward County, FL is NOT located west of Santa Clara County, CA.
      Rather, it''s the opposite: Broward County is EAST of Santa Clara County.


      The answer is NO.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic
      locations of both counties and compare their east-west positioning.


      Step 1: Identify where these counties are located.

      - Broward County is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States.

      - Santa Clara County is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Compare their locations on an east-west axis.

      - California forms part of the western border of the contiguous United States,
      along the Pacific Ocean.

      - Florida is in the southeastern US, extending into the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      - The continental United States spans from west (Pacific coast) to east (Atlantic
      coast).

      - California is on the western side of this span, while Florida is on the eastern
      side.

      - Therefore, Santa Clara County in California is west of Broward County in Florida,
      not the other way around.


      NO, Broward County, FL is not located west of Santa Clara County, CA. It is
      located east of it.'

      To determine which is further west, I need to think about the relative positions
      of Florida and California in the United States.


      Florida is on the east coast of the United States, extending into the Atlantic
      Ocean and Gulf of Mexico.

      California is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific
      Ocean.


      Generally speaking, any location in California will be west of any location
      in Florida, because California as a state is west of Florida as a state.


      Broward County is in southeastern Florida, in the Miami metropolitan area.

      Santa Clara County is in the San Francisco Bay Area of California.


      Since California is west of Florida, Santa Clara County (in California) would
      be west of Broward County (in Florida), not the other way around.


      So, is Broward County, FL located west of Santa Clara County, CA?


      No, Broward County is not west of Santa Clara County. Broward County is in Florida

      4. Florida borders the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico on the eastern/southeastern
      side of the country.


      5. California borders the Pacific Ocean on the western edge of the country.


      6. Any location in mainland Florida will be east of any location in mainland
      California.


      Therefore, Broward County, FL is located EAST of Santa Clara County, CA, not

      - California is the westernmost state in the contiguous United States.

      - Florida is one of the easternmost states in the United States.

      - When looking at a map of the US, California is on the left (west) and Florida
      is on the right (east).


      Step 3: Determine the answer.

      Since Broward County is in Florida (east) and Santa Clara County is in California
      (west), Broward County is east of Santa Clara County, not west of it.

      relative locations of two US counties: Miami-Dade County, FL and Dallas County,
      TX. Specifically, it''s asking whether Miami-Dade County is located west of
      Dallas County.


      To answer this, I need to recall the geographic locations of these counties:


      1. Miami-Dade County is in the southeastern part of Florida, on the Atlantic
      coast. Florida itself is in the southeastern United States.


      2. Dallas County is in north-central Texas. Texas is in the south-central United
      States, bordering Mexico to the south.


      When comparing east-west positions in the US, I need to think about their relative
      longitudes:


      - Florida is generally east of Texas on a map of the United States.

      - Miami is on the eastern coast of Florida, facing the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Dallas is in the eastern half of Texas, but Texas as a whole is significantly
      west of Florida.


      So Miami-Dade County, FL is located EAST of Dallas County, TX - not west.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Miami-Dade County is not west of Dallas County.</think>To

      - Dallas County is located in north-central Texas.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of Florida and Texas.

      - Florida is in the southeastern United States.

      - Texas is in the south-central United States, significantly west of Florida.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Miami is on the eastern coast of Florida, which puts it quite far east in
      the continental US.

      - Dallas is in the eastern half of Texas, but Texas as a whole lies west of
      Florida.


      NO, Miami-Dade County, FL is not located west of Dallas County, TX. It is located

      Philadelphia County is in Pennsylvania, which is on the eastern side of the
      United States.


      Orleans Parish is in Louisiana, which is in the southern part of the United
      States.


      To determine which is farther west, I need to consider their longitude values.
      Places that are more west have higher longitude values in the western hemisphere
      (or more negative values, since western hemisphere longitudes are typically
      expressed as negative numbers).


      Let me recall the approximate locations:

      - Philadelphia, PA is on the east coast of the US, roughly in the northeastern
      part of the country.

      - Orleans Parish, LA (which contains the city of New Orleans) is on the Gulf
      Coast in the southern part of the US.


      When comparing east-west positioning, New Orleans (Orleans Parish) is significantly

      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Philadelphia County is in Pennsylvania (PA), which is located on the eastern
      seaboard of the United States.

      - Orleans Parish is in Louisiana (LA), which is located in the southern United
      States along the Gulf of Mexico.


      ## Step 2: Consider their longitudes

      - Philadelphia is positioned in the northeastern part of the US, very close
      to the Atlantic Ocean.

      - New Orleans (in Orleans Parish) is positioned along the Mississippi River
      delta near the Gulf of Mexico, significantly inland from the eastern seaboard.


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis

      Looking at a US map, Philadelphia County is clearly situated on the eastern
      coast, while Orleans Parish is much farther west in the central-southern part
      of the country.


      NO - Philadelphia County, PA is NOT located west of Orleans Parish, LA. It is

      relative positions of two US counties: Bronx County, NY and San Francisco County,
      CA. Let me think about where these counties are located.


      Bronx County is one of the five boroughs of New York City, located in the state
      of New York, which is on the East Coast of the United States.


      San Francisco County is in California, which is on the West Coast of the United
      States.


      The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the
      Pacific Ocean on the west. New York is near the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast,
      while California is near the Pacific Ocean on the west coast.


      In terms of longitude (east-west position), the eastern states like New York
      are east of the western states like California. So Bronx County, being in New
      York, is east of San Francisco County, which is in California.


      To be "west of" San Francisco County, Bronx County would need to have a longitude
      value that is more westerly (i.e., a greater negative number, since longitudes
      in the Western Hemisphere are given as negative values) than San Francisco County.
      But since Bronx County is on the East Coast and San Francisco County is on the
      West Coast, Bronx County is actually east of San Francisco County, not west.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Bronx County, NY located west of San
      Francisco County, CA?" is NO.</think># Is Bronx County, NY located west of San

      Let me think about the geographical locations of these two counties:


      1. Bronx County is located in New York state, on the East Coast of the United
      States.

      2. San Francisco County is located in California, on the West Coast of the United
      States.

      3. In the United States, the East Coast is east of the West Coast.

      4. When considering longitude (east-west positioning), New York is significantly
      east of California.


      Since Bronx County is on the East Coast and San Francisco County is on the West
      Coast, Bronx County is located to the east of San Francisco County, not to the
      west.

      to determine whether the District of Columbia, DC is located west of Maricopa
      County, AZ. I''ll solve this by identifying the locations of both places and
      comparing their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - District of Columbia (DC) is on the east coast of the United States, between
      Maryland and Virginia.

      - Maricopa County is in Arizona (AZ), which is in the southwestern United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on the east-west axis.

      In the United States, locations are generally considered "west" if they have
      a higher longitude value (more negative, since the U.S. is in the western hemisphere).
      The east coast has less negative (or smaller absolute value) longitude than
      the west coast.


      - DC is on the east coast, so it''s relatively far east in the continental United
      States.

      - Arizona is in the southwest, much closer to the west coast than DC.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      DC is on the east coast, while Maricopa County, AZ is in the southwestern part
      of the country. This means that DC is east of Maricopa County, not west of it.


      Therefore, the District of Columbia is NOT located west of Maricopa County,
      AZ.</think># Is District of Columbia, DC located west of Maricopa County, AZ?

      - Maricopa County is located in Arizona (AZ), which is in the southwestern United
      States.


      ## Step 2: Compare their east-west positions

      - The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west).

      - DC is on the Atlantic (eastern) side of the country.

      - Arizona is much closer to the Pacific side, in the southwestern region.


      ## Step 3: Draw a conclusion

      Since DC is on the east coast and Maricopa County is in the southwest, DC is
      east of Maricopa County, not west of it.

      Kings County is the official name for Brooklyn, which is one of the five boroughs
      of New York City, located on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify what Denver County, CO is.

      Denver County is coterminous with the City of Denver, the capital of Colorado,
      located in the western/central United States in the Rocky Mountain region.

      The United States generally spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west). New York is on the Atlantic coast, while Colorado is considerably
      further west in the continental interior.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since New York is on the east coast and Colorado is much further west, Kings
      County (Brooklyn) is EAST of Denver County, not west of it.

      First, let me identify these counties:

      - Kings County, NY is in New York state. It''s actually another name for Brooklyn,
      which is one of the five boroughs of New York City, located on the eastern coast
      of the United States.

      - Denver County, CO is in Colorado, which is in the western part of the United
      States, in the Rocky Mountain region.


      Now, to determine which is further west, I need to consider the general geography
      of the US:

      - New York is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Colorado is in the interior western part of the United States

      - The United States generally runs from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west)


      New York is on the East Coast, while Colorado is much further west. Even though
      Denver is not on the West Coast (states like California, Oregon, and Washington
      are further west), Denver is still substantially west of any point in New York
      state.


      Therefore, Kings County (Brooklyn) in NY cannot be west of Denver County, CO.
      Instead, Kings County is east of Denver County.

      City, located on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      - Denver County, CO contains the city of Denver and is located in Colorado in
      the Rocky Mountain region of the western United States.

      Kings County, NY is a county in New York state. It''s actually the official
      name for Brooklyn, which is one of the five boroughs of New York City. New York
      City is located on the east coast of the United States.


      Denver County, CO is a county in Colorado state, and it encompasses the city
      of Denver, which is the capital of Colorado. Colorado is located in the western/central
      part of the United States, in the Rocky Mountain region.


      2. Now I need to determine which one is further west.


      The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean
      in the west. New York is on the Atlantic (east) coast, while Colorado is much
      further inland, towards the middle/western part of the country.


      In terms of longitude (which measures east-west position), locations further
      west have higher longitude values in the western hemisphere. Since Kings County

      No, Kings County, NY (Brooklyn) is not west of Denver County, CO. It''s actually
      considerably to the east of Denver County.


      I should actually correct my point about longitude values. In the western hemisphere
