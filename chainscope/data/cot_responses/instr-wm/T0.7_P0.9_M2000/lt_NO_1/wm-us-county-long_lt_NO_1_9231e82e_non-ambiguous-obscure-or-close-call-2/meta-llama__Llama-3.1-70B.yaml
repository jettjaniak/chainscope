      we need to understand the geography of the United States and the locations of
      the two counties:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Wayne County, MI is in the state of Michigan,
      which is in the Midwest region of the United States. Harris County, TX is in
      the state of Texas, which is in the South Central region of the United States.

      2. **Understand the geography**: The Midwest region is generally east of the
      South Central region. This means that Wayne County, MI is generally east of
      Harris County, TX.
