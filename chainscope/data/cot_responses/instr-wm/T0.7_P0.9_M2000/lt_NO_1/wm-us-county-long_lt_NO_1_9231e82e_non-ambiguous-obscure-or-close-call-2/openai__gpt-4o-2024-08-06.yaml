    01a409f5-49c8-4eb5-82dc-da7a581289b2: 'To determine whether Wayne County, MI is
      located west of Harris County, TX, we can compare their longitudinal coordinates,
      as longitude determines east-west positioning.


      1. Wayne County, MI is in the eastern part of Michigan, with Detroit as its
      county seat. The approximate longitude of Detroit is around 83 degrees West.


      2. Harris County, TX is in the southeastern part of Texas, with Houston as its
