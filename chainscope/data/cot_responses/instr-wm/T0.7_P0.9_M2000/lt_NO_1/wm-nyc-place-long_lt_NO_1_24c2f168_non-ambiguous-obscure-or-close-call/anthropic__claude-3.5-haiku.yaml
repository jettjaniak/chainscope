      3. Determine relative geographic positions:

      - JFK Airport is in southeastern Queens

      - NYU School of Law is in Lower Manhattan

      - Manhattan is west of Queens


      4. Check the specific west/east positioning:

      - Queens is east of Manhattan

      - JFK Airport in Queens is further east than NYU Law School in Manhattan


      5. Therefore, JFK Terminals 1, 2, 3 GAR are NOT west of NYU Law School.


      Answer: NO'
    e9dbe725-f991-4c50-b439-eeee963343a1: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate JFK Airport Terminals 1, 2, 3 GAR:

      - These terminals are located in Queens, New York

      - They are at the southeastern part of Queens, near Jamaica Bay


      2. Locate New York University School of Law:

      - This is located in Manhattan

      - Specifically, it''s in Greenwich Village, in the lower/southwestern part of
      Manhattan


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - JFK Airport is in southeastern Queens

      - NYU School of Law is in southwestern Manhattan

      - Manhattan is west of Queens


      4. Determine relative positioning:

      - Since Queens is east of Manhattan, and JFK is in southeastern Queens

      - JFK Terminals 1, 2, 3 GAR would be east of NYU School of Law, not west


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO'

      1. First, locate JFK Airport''s Terminals 1, 2, 3 GAR in Queens

      - These terminals are located in southeastern Queens

      - They are situated in the southeastern part of New York City


      2. Next, locate NYU School of Law in Manhattan

      - NYU School of Law is located in Greenwich Village, Lower Manhattan

      - Specifically, it''s at 40 Washington Square South


      3. Compare the geographical positions

      - JFK Airport is in southeastern Queens

      - NYU Law School is in Lower Manhattan

      - Manhattan is west of Queens


      4. Determine the relative west/east positioning

      - Queens is east of Manhattan

      - JFK Airport (in Queens) is therefore east of NYU Law School (in Manhattan)


      5. Answer the specific question: Is JFK Terminals 1, 2, 3 GAR west of NYU Law

      1. First, locate the Gucci Store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan

      - This is located near 54th Street on 5th Avenue


      2. Next, locate the High Line W 16 St Entrance

      - The High Line is an elevated park on Manhattan''s west side

      - The W 16 St entrance is in the Chelsea neighborhood


      3. Compare their geographical positions

      - The Gucci Store on 5th Avenue is in Midtown Manhattan, which is east of the
      High Line

      - The High Line runs along the west side of Manhattan


      4. Determine relative positions

      - The Gucci Store is east of the High Line W 16 St entrance

      - "West of" would mean being further west than the High Line entrance


      5. Therefore, the Gucci Store is NOT west of the High Line W 16 St entrance

      - Grand Central Terminal is located in Midtown Manhattan

      - Its address is 89 E 42nd Street

      - It is situated east of 5th Avenue


      2. Next, let''s locate Brooklyn Bridge EN RP Pearl St:

      - Brooklyn Bridge spans the East River between Manhattan and Brooklyn

      - The Pearl Street referenced is in Lower Manhattan

      - This location is in Lower Manhattan, which is south and west of Midtown


      3. Comparing their relative positions:

      - Grand Central Terminal is east of Pearl Street

      - Pearl Street is west of Grand Central Terminal


      4. Reasoning about west/east positioning:

      - Since Grand Central Terminal is east of the Pearl Street location, it is NOT
      west of the Brooklyn Bridge EN RP Pearl St location


      5. Therefore, the answer to "Is GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL, Manhattan located west
      of BROOKLYN BRIDGE EN RP PEARL ST, Manhattan?" is:

      - It is located in Midtown Manhattan, which is in the central part of the island


      3. Since Ellis Island is not in Manhattan proper, and is located to the south/southwest
