      Beatles:

      - This song was released in May 1970, as part of the "Let It Be" album

      - This song was released in 1985 as part of her debut album "Whitney Houston"


      2. Next, I''ll find the release date of Selena Gomez''s "Come & Get It":

      - This song was released in 2013 as part of her album "Stars Dance"


      3. Comparing the two dates:

      - 1985 is much earlier than 2013

      - Whitney Houston''s song was released 28 years before Selena Gomez''s song


      4. The question asks: Was Selena Gomez''s song released earlier?

      - No, it was not. Whitney Houston''s song was released much earlier.

      2. Next, I''ll find the release date of "Love on the Brain" by Rihanna

      - This song was released in 2016, on her album "ANTI"


      3. Compare the two dates

      - 1963 is much earlier than 2016

      - Therefore, "I Saw Her Standing There" was released BEFORE "Love on the Brain"


      4. The question asks if Rihanna''s song was released earlier, which is NOT true


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

    cfcbeb4e-dcb5-48df-b8da-fa211eec78e5: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s find the release date of "Layla (Acoustic)":

      - The original "Layla" was released in 1970 by Derek and the Dominos

      - The acoustic version was part of Eric Clapton''s "Unplugged" album

      - The "Unplugged" album was released in 1992


      2. Now, let''s find the release date of "I Get Around" by The Beach Boys:

      - "I Get Around" was released in 1964


      3. Comparing the two release dates:

      - "Layla (Acoustic)" was released in 1992

      - "I Get Around" was released in  1964

      - 1992 is later than 1964


      4. Therefore, "Layla (Acoustic)" was NOT released earlier than "I Get Around"

      - "Please Me" was released on February 15, 2019


      2. Next, let''s find the release date of Madonna''s "Crazy for You":

      - "Crazy for You" was released on February 20, 1985


      3. Compare the dates:

      - Cardi B''s song: February 15, 2019

      - Madonna''s song: February 20, 1985


      4. Determine which came first:

      - Madonna''s song was released in 1985

      - Cardi B''s song was released in 2019

      - Therefore, Madonna''s song came out much earlier


      The answer is: NO (Cardi B''s "Please Me" was NOT released earlier than Madonna''s
      "Crazy for You")'
