      "Fear of the Dark" is the title track from Iron Maiden''s 1992 album, which
      means it was released in 1992.


      3. Now, comparing the two release dates: 1967 for "Higher and Higher" and 1992
      for "Fear of the Dark".


      Since 1967 is earlier than 1992, Jackie Wilson''s "(Your Love Keeps Lifting
      Me) Higher and Higher" was indeed released earlier than Iron Maiden''s "Fear
      of the Dark".


      The answer is: YES'

      we need to know the release dates of both songs.


      1. **Identify the release date of Elton John''s "Bennie and the Jets":** "Bennie
      and the Jets" was released in 1975 on Elton John''s album "Goodbye Yellow Brick
      Road" (though it was released as a single in February 1976 in the United States,
      it was part of the album released in October 1973 in the UK, and the song itself
      was written and recorded in 1972-1973).


      2. **Identify the release date of The Beatles''s "The Long and Winding Road":**
      "The Long and Winding Road" was released in 1970 on The Beatles''s album "Let
      It Be".


      Given these release dates:

      - "The Long and Winding Road" by The Beatles was released in 1970.

      - "Bennie and the Jets" by Elton John, while written and recorded around 1972-1973,
      was officially part of an album released in 1973 and as a single in 1976.


      Since "The Long and Winding Road" was released in 1970 and "Bennie and the Jets"
      was part of an album released in 1973 (and later as a single in 1976), "Bennie
      and the Jets" was released after "The Long and Winding Road".


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Release Year of Dan + Shay''s "10,000 Hours":** "10,000 Hours"
      is a song by Dan + Shay (with Justin Bieber), and it was released in 2019.


      2. **Identify the Release Year of System of a Down''s "Toxicity":** However,
      System of a Down does not have a song called "Toxicity" as a single release.
      "Toxicity" is actually the title of their second studio album, released in 2001.
      The album does contain several notable singles, but "Toxicity" itself refers
      to the album, not a specific song. It seems there might be confusion with Britney
      Spears'' song "Toxic," which was released in 2003.


      3. **Clarify the Comparison:** Since "Toxicity" is an album by System of a Down
      and not a song, and considering the question likely intended to compare song
      release dates, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the question''s premise.
      However, if we consider the release of the album "Toxicity" by System of a Down
      in 2001 as the point of comparison (since it''s the closest relevant release),
      we can proceed under the assumption the question meant to compare the release

      4. **Compare the Release Dates:** Given that "10,000 Hours" was released in

      Hours" was released much later than "Toxicity."

      is a song by Dan + Shay, featuring Justin Bieber. It was released on October
      4, 2019.


      2. **Identify the Release Date of "Toxicity" by System of a Down**: "Toxicity"
      is an album by System of a Down, but it seems there might be a bit of confusion
      in the question since "Toxicity" is the title of the album, not a song. However,
      System of a Down does have a song titled "Toxicity" which is part of the album
      of the same name. The album "Toxicity" was released on September 4, 2001. The
      song "Toxicity" would have been released around the same time as the album.


      3. **Compare the Release Dates**: Now, we compare the release dates of the two.
      "10,000 Hours" was released on October 4, 2019, and "Toxicity" (the song or
      the album) was released on September 4, 2001.


      Given these dates, "Toxicity" by System of a Down was released earlier than
      "10,000 Hours" by Dan + Shay.


      The answer to whether "10,000 Hours" was released earlier than "Toxicity" is:
      **NO**'

      we need to determine the release dates of both "10,000 Hours" by Dan + Shay
      and "Toxicity" by System of a Down.


      1. **Identify the Release Date of "10,000 Hours"**: "10,000 Hours" is a song
      by Dan + Shay (with Justin Bieber), and according to various music sources,
      it was released on October 4, 2019.


      2. **Identify the Release Date of "Toxicity"**: "Toxicity" is an album by System
      of a Down, not a single song. However, assuming the question refers to the album
      "Toxicity" rather than a song titled "Toxicity" (since System of a Down does
      not have a song by that name, but Britney Spears does), "Toxicity" the album
      was released on September 4, 2001.


      Given these dates:

      - "Toxicity" (the album) by System of a Down was released on September 4, 2001.

      - "10,000 Hours" by Dan + Shay (with Justin Bieber) was released on October
      4, 2019.


      Since 2001 is before 2019, "Toxicity" (the album) was released earlier than

      1. **Identify the Release Date of "10,000 Hours"**: "10,000 Hours" is a song
      by Dan + Shay, featuring Justin Bieber. It was released on October 4, 2019.

      because "Toxicity" is the title of an album, not a song. System of a Down does
      have a song called "Toxicity" within this album, but the title track "Toxicity"
      was indeed released as part of the album in 2001.


      Given the information:

      - "10,000 Hours" was released in 2019.

      - "Toxicity" (the album and presumably the song) was released in 2001.


      Since 2001 is earlier than 2019, we can conclude that "Toxicity" by System of
      a Down was released earlier than "10,000 Hours" by Dan + Shay.


      The answer to the question "Was Dan + Shay''s 10,000 Hours released earlier

    bbf71c8f-56b1-4792-aed0-eb36cd5667bf: '<think></think>To answer this question,
      we need to establish the release dates of both "10,000 Hours" by Dan + Shay
      and "Toxicity" by System of a Down.


      1. **Identify the release date of "10,000 Hours" by Dan + Shay**: "10,000 Hours"
      is a song by Dan + Shay (feat. Justin Bieber), and it was released on October
      4, 2019.


      2. **Identify the release date of "Toxicity" by System of a Down**: "Toxicity"
      is an album by System of a Down, released on September 4, 2001. However, it
      seems there might be a bit of confusion in the question since "Toxicity" is
      the title of an album, not a song. The album does contain a song called "Toxicity,"
      but the album itself is what''s commonly referred to by that name.


      3. **Clarification on "Toxicity"**: Assuming the question refers to the album
      "Toxicity" and considering one of its most popular tracks shares the same name,
      we should note the album was released in 2001. One of the most famous songs
      from this album is actually "Chop Suey!" or the title track "Toxicity," both
      released in 2001.


      Given these release dates:


      - "10,000 Hours" by Dan + Shay was released on October 4, 2019.

      - "Toxicity" (the album and its title track) by System of a Down was released
      on September 4, 2001.


      Since "Toxicity" (whether referring to the album or its song) was released in
      2001 and "10,000 Hours" was released in 2019, "10,000 Hours" was not released
      earlier than "Toxicity."


      The answer is: **NO**'
    e754f331-4a40-4cda-b08b-29081fcca682: '<think></think>To answer this question,
      let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Identify the Release Year of "10,000 Hours" by Dan + Shay**: The song "10,000
      Hours" is a collaboration between Dan + Shay and Justin Bieber. It was released
      on October 4, 2019.


      2. **Identify the Release Year of "Toxicity" by System of a Down**: "Toxicity"
      is an album by System of a Down, released on September 4, 2001. The question
      seems to refer to the album rather than a song titled "Toxicity" (since the
      album has a song called "Toxicity" but it''s more likely asking about the album
      given the context). However, to clarify, the song "Toxicity" from the album
      of the same name was also released in 2001.


      3. **Compare the Release Years**: Now, we compare the release years of both.
      "10,000 Hours" was released in 2019, and "Toxicity" (album or song) was released
      in 2001.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since 2001 is earlier than 2019, "Toxicity" (whether referring
      to the album or the song) by System of a Down was released earlier than "10,000
      Hours" by Dan + Shay (and Justin Bieber).

      that "Mr. Jones" by Counting Crows was released before "Walk It Talk It" by

      we need to consider the release dates of the two songs by Taylor Swift: "Exile"
      and "Our Song".


      1. **Identify the albums**: "Exile" is a song from the album "Folklore", which
      is a collaboration between Taylor Swift and Bon Iver. "Our Song" is a song from
      Taylor Swift''s second studio album, "Fearless".


      2. **Determine the release dates of the albums**: The album "Fearless" was released
      on November 11, 2008. The album "Folklore" was released on July 23, 2020.


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Since "Fearless" was released in 2008 and
      "Folklore" was released in 2020, any song from "Fearless", including "Our Song",
      was released earlier than any song from "Folklore", including "Exile".


      Based on this reasoning, the answer to whether "Exile" was released earlier
      than "Our Song" is NO.'

    df6809b7-5007-481d-9f53-a96c7ab94580: '<think></think>To answer this question,
      we need to compare the release dates of the two songs: "Angel" by Sarah McLachlan
      and "Gin and Juice" by Snoop Dogg.


      1. **Identify the release year of "Gin and Juice"**: Snoop Dogg''s "Gin and
      Juice" was released in 1994. It was a single from his debut album "Doggystyle",
      which came out on November 23, 1993, but "Gin and Juice" itself was released
      as a single in January 1994.


      2. **Identify the release year of "Angel"**: Sarah McLachlan''s "Angel" was
      released in 1993. It was a single from her album "Surfacing", but initially,
      it appeared on the soundtrack for the film "City of Angels" in 1998. However,
      the song itself was written and first released in 1993 on the "Surfacing" album,
      which came out on July 28, 1997, in some regions, but the song was initially
      conceived and written before its official release.


      Given the confusion around the exact release timing of "Angel" due to its inclusion
      on different albums and soundtracks, the key detail is recognizing that "Angel"
      was indeed part of McLachlan''s work before 1998. However, considering the actual
      release of "Surfacing" happened in 1997, and "Gin and Juice" was out in 1994,
      we need to focus on when "Angel" was first publicly available, which was after
      "Gin and Juice".


      So, comparing the release dates:

      - "Gin and Juice" was released in 1994.

      - "Angel" was part of McLachlan''s work before its official release on "Surfacing"
      in 1997, making it seem like it could be earlier, but the actual public release
      was later.


      Given this, the correct sequence based on public release dates is that "Gin
      and Juice" came out before "Angel" was officially released on the "Surfacing"
      album.


      Therefore, the answer to whether "Angel" was released earlier than "Gin and
      Juice" is: **NO**.'

      "Angel" was released earlier than Snoop Dogg''s "Gin and Juice," we need to

      1. **Identify the Release Date of "Gin and Juice":** Snoop Dogg''s "Gin and
      Juice" was released in 1994. It was a single from his debut album "Doggystyle,"
      which came out on November 23, 1993, but "Gin and Juice" itself was released
      as a single on January 15, 1994.


      2. **Identify the Release Date of "Angel":** Sarah McLachlan''s "Angel" was
      released in 1993. It was part of her album "Surfacing," but "Angel" was initially
      released as a single in 1993, after being featured on the soundtrack of the
      film "City of Angels" is not correct as that was in 1998, "Angel" was actually
      first released on the album "Surfacing" in 1997 in some markets but initially
      as part of a soundtrack in 1993 for "Touch - Songs For The Sense Of" and then
      it gained popularity after the death of Smashing Pumpkins keyboardist Jonathan
      Melvoin and then widely released in 1998-1999 in some markets but initially
      released in 1993.


      Given these steps, we can conclude that "Angel" was initially released in 1993,
      and "Gin and Juice" was released in 1994.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'

      of Swing" was released in 1978.

      2. Next, identify the release date of "Safe and Sound" by Capital Cities. "Safe

    52daff3f-ebc3-494c-bd6a-8ac6495c70dd: '<think></think>To determine if Elton John''s
      Sacrifice was released earlier than The Pogues''s Fairytale of New York, let''s
      look at the release dates of the two songs.


      1. The Pogues''s Fairytale of New York was released in 1987.

      2. Elton John''s Sacrifice was released in 1989, initially as a single from
      the album Sleeping with the Past, but it gained popularity and became a hit
      in 1990 after being re-released.


      Given these release dates, we can conclude that Fairytale of New York was released
      before Sacrifice.


      So, the answer to the question is: NO'

      of New York" was released before "Sacrifice".


      Given these steps, the answer to whether Elton John''s "Sacrifice" was released

      June for the album and October for the single in some countries).


      2. The Pogues''s Fairytale of New York: This song was released in 1987 as a
      single from The Pogues'' album "If I Should Fall from Grace with God".


      Now, comparing the release dates:

      - Fairytale of New York was released in 1987.

      - Sacrifice was released in 1989.


      Since 1987 is earlier than 1989, Fairytale of New York was released before Sacrifice.
