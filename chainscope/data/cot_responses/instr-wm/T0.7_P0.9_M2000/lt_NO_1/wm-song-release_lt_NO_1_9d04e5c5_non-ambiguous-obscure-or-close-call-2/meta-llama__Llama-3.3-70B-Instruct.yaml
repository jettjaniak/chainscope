      2013.

      1. **Identify the Release Date of "10,000 Hours"**: "10,000 Hours" is a song
      by Dan + Shay (with Justin Bieber), and according to various music sources,
      it was released on October 4, 2019.


      2. **Identify the Release Date of "Toxicity"**: "Toxicity" is an album by System
      of a Down, not a single song. However, assuming the question refers to the album
      "Toxicity" rather than a song titled "Toxicity" (since System of a Down does
      not have a song by that name, but Britney Spears does), "Toxicity" the album
      was released on September 4, 2001.


      Given these dates:

      - "Toxicity" (the album) by System of a Down was released on September 4, 2001.

      - "10,000 Hours" by Dan + Shay (with Justin Bieber) was released on October
      4, 2019.

      because "Toxicity" is the title of an album, not a song. System of a Down does
      have a song called "Toxicity" within this album, but the title track "Toxicity"
      was indeed released as part of the album in 2001.


      Given the information:

      we need to establish the release dates of both "10,000 Hours" by Dan + Shay

      1. **Identify the release date of "10,000 Hours" by Dan + Shay**: "10,000 Hours"
      is a song by Dan + Shay (feat. Justin Bieber), and it was released on October
      4, 2019.


      2. **Identify the release date of "Toxicity" by System of a Down**: "Toxicity"
      is an album by System of a Down, released on September 4, 2001. However, it
      seems there might be a bit of confusion in the question since "Toxicity" is
      the title of an album, not a song. The album does contain a song called "Toxicity,"
      but the album itself is what''s commonly referred to by that name.


      3. **Clarification on "Toxicity"**: Assuming the question refers to the album
      "Toxicity" and considering one of its most popular tracks shares the same name,
      we should note the album was released in 2001. One of the most famous songs
      from this album is actually "Chop Suey!" or the title track "Toxicity," both
      released in 2001.


      Given these release dates:


      - "10,000 Hours" by Dan + Shay was released on October 4, 2019.

      - "Toxicity" (the album and its title track) by System of a Down was released
      on September 4, 2001.


      Since "Toxicity" (whether referring to the album or its song) was released in
      2001 and "10,000 Hours" was released in 2019, "10,000 Hours" was not released
      earlier than "Toxicity."

      Hours" is a collaboration between Dan + Shay and Justin Bieber. It was released
      on October 4, 2019.


      2. **Identify the Release Year of "Toxicity" by System of a Down**: "Toxicity"
      is an album by System of a Down, released on September 4, 2001. The question
      seems to refer to the album rather than a song titled "Toxicity" (since the
      album has a song called "Toxicity" but it''s more likely asking about the album
      given the context). However, to clarify, the song "Toxicity" from the album
      of the same name was also released in 2001.


      3. **Compare the Release Years**: Now, we compare the release years of both.
      "10,000 Hours" was released in 2019, and "Toxicity" (album or song) was released
      in 2001.

      released in 2004 as a single from Destiny''s Child''s fourth and final studio
      album, "Destiny Fulfilled".

      it appeared on the soundtrack for the film "City of Angels" in 1998. However,
      the song itself was written and first released in 1993 on the "Surfacing" album,
      which came out on July 28, 1997, in some regions, but the song was initially
      conceived and written before its official release.


      Given the confusion around the exact release timing of "Angel" due to its inclusion
      on different albums and soundtracks, the key detail is recognizing that "Angel"
      was indeed part of McLachlan''s work before 1998. However, considering the actual
      release of "Surfacing" happened in 1997, and "Gin and Juice" was out in 1994,
      we need to focus on when "Angel" was first publicly available, which was after
      "Gin and Juice".


      So, comparing the release dates:

      - "Gin and Juice" was released in 1994.

      - "Angel" was part of McLachlan''s work before its official release on "Surfacing"
      in 1997, making it seem like it could be earlier, but the actual public release
      was later.


      Given this, the correct sequence based on public release dates is that "Gin
      and Juice" came out before "Angel" was officially released on the "Surfacing"
      album.


      Therefore, the answer to whether "Angel" was released earlier than "Gin and
      Juice" is: **NO**.'

      "Angel" was released earlier than Snoop Dogg''s "Gin and Juice," we need to
      consider the release dates of both songs.


      1. **Identify the Release Date of "Gin and Juice":** Snoop Dogg''s "Gin and
      Juice" was released in 1994. It was a single from his debut album "Doggystyle,"
      which came out on November 23, 1993, but "Gin and Juice" itself was released
      as a single on January 15, 1994.


      2. **Identify the Release Date of "Angel":** Sarah McLachlan''s "Angel" was
      released in 1993. It was part of her album "Surfacing," but "Angel" was initially
      released as a single in 1993, after being featured on the soundtrack of the
      film "City of Angels" is not correct as that was in 1998, "Angel" was actually
      first released on the album "Surfacing" in 1997 in some markets but initially
      as part of a soundtrack in 1993 for "Touch - Songs For The Sense Of" and then
      it gained popularity after the death of Smashing Pumpkins keyboardist Jonathan
      Melvoin and then widely released in 1998-1999 in some markets but initially
      released in 1993.


      Given these steps, we can conclude that "Angel" was initially released in 1993,
      and "Gin and Juice" was released in 1994.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'

      song "Take Me to Church" was released in 2013. It was a single from his debut
      EP "Take Me to Church" and later included on his self-titled album "Hozier"

      Race" was released in 2017. It gained popularity after the artist was arrested

      Given these release dates:


      - Hozier''s "Take Me to Church" was released in 2013.

      - Tay-K''s "The Race" was released in 2017.
