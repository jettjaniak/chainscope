      we need to look at the release dates for both songs:


      1. "Sweet Child o'' Mine" by Guns N'' Roses was released as a single in August
      1988. The song is from their debut studio album, "Appetite for Destruction,"
      which was released in July 1987.


      2. "My Generation" by The Who was released as a single in October 1965. It is
      also the title track of their debut studio album, which was released in December
      1965.


      Comparing the release years, "My Generation" was released in 1965, while "Sweet
      Child o'' Mine" was released in 1988.
