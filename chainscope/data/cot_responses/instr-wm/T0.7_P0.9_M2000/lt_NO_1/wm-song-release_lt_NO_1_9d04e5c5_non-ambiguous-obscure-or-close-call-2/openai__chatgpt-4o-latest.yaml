      Got a Gun" was released earlier than Van Halen''s "Panama," we need to determine
      the release years of both songs.


      Step 1: Determine the release year of Van Halen''s "Panama."

      - "Panama" was released as a single from Van Halen''s album "1984," which came
      out in 1984.


      Step 2: Determine the release year of Aerosmith''s "Janie''s Got a Gun."

      - "Janie''s Got a Gun" was released as a single from Aerosmith''s album "Pump,"
      which came out in 1989.


      Step 3: Compare the two release years.

      - Van Halen''s "Panama": 1984

      - Aerosmith''s "Janie''s Got a Gun": 1989


      Since 1984 is earlier than 1989, "Panama" was released earlier than "Janie''s

      \ Answer: NO**  \nMichael Jackson's \"Thriller\" was not released earlier than\
      \ Marvin Gaye's \"You're All I Need to Get By\"."
    97a2fc26-d7cb-479a-923f-6043e5ffca77: 'To determine the correct answer, we need
      to find the release dates of both songs and compare them.


      Step 1: Determine the release date of Michael Jackson''s "Thriller".


      - "Thriller" is a song from the album of the same name by Michael Jackson.

      - The album "Thriller" was released on November 30, 1982.

      - The single "Thriller" was released later on January 23, 1984.


      Step 2: Determine the release date of Marvin Gaye''s "You''re All I Need to
      Get By".


      - "You''re All I Need to Get By" is a duet by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell.

      - It was released in 1968.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.


      - 1968 (Marvin Gaye) vs. 1984 (Michael Jackson''s single) or 1982 (Thriller
      album).


      Since 1968 is earlier than both 1982 and 1984, Marvin Gaye''s "You''re All I
      Need to Get By" was released earlier than Michael Jackson''s "Thriller".


      Final Answer: **NO**.'
