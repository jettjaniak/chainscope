    85445a52-6bfa-46fa-b5bd-ce60ddf691bc: 'To determine if Bon Jovi''s
      "Wanted Dead or Alive" was released earlier than Chicago''s "You''re the Inspiration",
      we need to compare their release dates.


      1. First, we need to find the release date of "Wanted Dead or Alive" by Bon
      Jovi.

      The song "Wanted Dead or Alive" was released on March 2, 1987, as part of the
      album "Slippery When Wet".


      2. Next, we need to find the release date of "You''re the Inspiration" by Chicago.

      The song "You''re the Inspiration" was released in 1984, as part of the album
      "Chicago 17".


      3. Now, we compare the release dates to determine which song was released earlier.

      Since 1984 is earlier than 1987, Chicago''s "You''re the Inspiration" was released
      earlier than Bon Jovi''s "Wanted Dead or Alive".


      So, considering the question asks if "Wanted Dead or Alive" was released earlier
      than "You''re the Inspiration", the answer would be based on whether "Wanted
      Dead or Alive" came out before "You''re the Inspiration".


      The answer is: NO

      1. First, we need to find the release date of 21 Savage''s "Runnin". According
      to online sources, "Runnin" was released on July 10, 2020.


      2. Next, we need to find the release date of Arctic Monkeys''s "R U Mine??"
      According to online sources, "R U Mine??" was released on February 27, 2012.


      3. Now, we compare the release dates to determine which song was released earlier.
      Since 2012 is before 2020, Arctic Monkeys''s "R U Mine??" was released earlier
      than 21 Savage''s "Runnin".


      So, considering the question asks if "Runnin" was released earlier than "R U
      Mine??", the answer would be based on whether "Runnin" came out before "R U
      Mine??".


      The answer is: NO

      in the Attic".


      4. Now, we compare the release dates to determine which song was released earlier.


      Since 1975 is before 2005, "Sweet Emotion" was released earlier than "Mayor
      Que Yo".


      So, considering the question asks if "Mayor Que Yo" was released earlier than
      "Sweet Emotion", the answer would be based on whether "Mayor Que Yo" came out
      before "Sweet Emotion".


      The answer is: NO
