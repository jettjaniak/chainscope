      - Travis Scott''s "Butterfly Effect" was released in 2017 (specifically May
      2017)

      Scott''s song

      earlier

      NO (Lady Gaga''s song was not released earlier than The Beatles'' song)'
    f1072dfe-fc52-4ed9-b6a8-96cb32342f0e: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s identify when "Always Remember Us This Way" was released

      - This song was released in 2018 as part of the "A Star Is Born" soundtrack


      2. Next, let''s identify when "Across the Universe" was released

      - The Beatles released this song in 1969 on their album "Let It Be"

      - It was recorded in 1968


      3. Now let''s compare:

      - 1969 comes before 2018

      - Therefore, "Across the Universe" was released earlier than "Always Remember
      Us This Way"

      - The question asks if Lady Gaga''s song was released earlier, which is the
      opposite


      NO'
