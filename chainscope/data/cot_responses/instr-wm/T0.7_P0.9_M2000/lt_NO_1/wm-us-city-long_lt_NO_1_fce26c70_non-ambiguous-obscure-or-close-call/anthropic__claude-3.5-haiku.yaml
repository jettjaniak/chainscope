      1. First, let''s consider the geographic locations of Bronx, NY and Atlanta,
      GA on a map of the United States.


      2. Bronx is located in New York, which is in the northeastern part of the United
      States.


      3. Atlanta is located in Georgia, which is in the southeastern part of the United
      States.


      4. When we look at a map, New York is east of Georgia.


      5. Therefore, the Bronx is east of Atlanta, not west.


      6. The question asks if the Bronx is west of Atlanta.


      7. Since the Bronx is actually east of Atlanta, the answer is NO.


      Answer: NO'
