      1. First, let''s identify when Selena Quintanilla lived:

      - Selena was a Mexican-American singer

      - She was born on April 16, 1971

      - She was tragically murdered on March 31, 1995

      - So she lived from 1971 to 1995


      2. Now, let''s identify when Leonardo da Vinci lived:

      - Leonardo da Vinci was an Italian Renaissance artist and polymath

      - He was born on April 15, 1452

      - He died on May 2, 1519

      - So he lived from 1452 to 1519


      3. Comparing their lifespans:

      - Leonardo da Vinci died in 1519

      - Selena Quintanilla died in 1995

      - This means Selena died much later than Leonardo da Vinci


      4. The question is: Did Selena die earlier than Leonardo?

      - No, she did not. Leonardo died centuries before Selena was even born.


      Answer: NO'
