      \ west of the Teton Range, WY, let's analyze their geographical locations step\
      \ by step:\n\n1. **Location of Lake Erie, OH**:\n   - Lake Erie is one of the\
      \ Great Lakes and borders the northern part of Ohio.\n   - The city of Cleveland,\
      \ OH, sits on its southern shore, and this area lies in the eastern part of\
      \ the United States.\n   - Approximate longitude of Lake Erie near Ohio: around\
      \ 81\xB0W.\n\n2. **Location of the Teton Range, WY**:\n   - The Teton Range\
      \ is located in northwestern Wyoming.\n   - It includes Grand Teton National\
      \ Park.\n   - Approximate longitude of the Teton Range: around 110\xB0W.\n\n\
      3. **Comparing Longitudes**:\n   - The lower the longitude number (more negative\
      \ in the western hemisphere), the farther west it is.\n   - 110\xB0W (Teton\
      \ Range) is farther west than 81\xB0W (Lake Erie).\n\n**Conclusion**:\nSince\
      \ 81\xB0W (Lake Erie) is east of 110\xB0W (Teton Range), Lake Erie is located\
      \ east \u2014 not west \u2014 of the Teton Range.\n\n**Answer**: NO."

      \ west of the Teton Range, WY, let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Locate\
      \ Lake Erie, OH**:\n   - Lake Erie is one of the five Great Lakes and forms\
      \ part of the boundary between the United States and Canada.\n   - The portion\
      \ referred to as Lake Erie, OH, suggests the part of the lake adjacent to the\
      \ state of Ohio, which is in the northeastern part of the U.S.\n   - Ohio is\
      \ in the Eastern Time Zone and is generally considered part of the Midwest or\
