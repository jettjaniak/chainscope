      1) First, let me recall the general locations:

      - Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, located on the northern border of Ohio

      - The Teton Range is in northwestern Wyoming


      2) To compare east-west positions, I need to think about their approximate longitudes:

      - Lake Erie/Ohio is roughly in the eastern third of the continental US

      - Wyoming is in the western portion of the continental US

      - The Tetons specifically are in the western part of Wyoming


      3) Therefore:

      - Lake Erie is significantly EAST of the Teton Range

      - The Teton Range is significantly WEST of Lake Erie


      Answer: NO, Lake Erie is not west of the Teton Range. It is east of it.'
