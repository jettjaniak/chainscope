      Ohio is located west of the Teton Range in Wyoming. Let me think about the geographic
      locations of these two places.


      1. Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, located on the northern border of Ohio
      (and also borders Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan, and the Canadian province
      of Ontario).


      2. The Teton Range is a mountain range in western Wyoming, part of the Rocky
      Mountains.


      In terms of east-west geography in the United States:

      - Generally, Wyoming is significantly west of Ohio.

      - The Teton Range is in the western part of Wyoming.

      - Lake Erie forms part of the northeastern border of Ohio.


      So geographically speaking, Lake Erie is located in the eastern part of the
      US, while the Teton Range is located in the western part of the US.


      Therefore, Lake Erie would be EAST of the Teton Range, not west.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the east-west relationship between these
      two geographic features.


      Step 1: Let me identify where Lake Erie, OH is located.

      Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes on the northern border of Ohio, in the eastern
      part of the United States.


      Step 2: Now let me identify where the Teton Range, WY is located.

      The Teton Range is a mountain range in western Wyoming, which is in the western
      part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      United States geography generally runs with lower longitudes (degrees west)
      on the east coast, increasing as you move westward. Ohio is significantly east
      of Wyoming. Lake Erie is on the eastern side of the country, while the Teton
      Range is much farther west in the Rocky Mountains.


      NO, Lake Erie, OH is not located west of Teton Range, WY. It is located east
      of it.'
    0af2e131-c4de-4261-95af-65d5f5333ab8: '<think>I need to determine the relative
      positions of Lake Erie, OH and the Teton Range, WY in the United States.


      Step 1: Let me recall where Lake Erie is located. Lake Erie is one of the Great
      Lakes, located in the northeastern part of the United States. It borders Ohio
      (OH) on its southern shore, but also borders Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan,
      and the Canadian province of Ontario.


      Step 2: Let me recall where the Teton Range is located. The Teton Range is a
      mountain range in Wyoming (WY), specifically in the western part of Wyoming,
      within Grand Teton National Park.


      Step 3: Now I need to determine which is further west. The United States generally
      has eastern states to the right (east) and western states to the left (west)
      when looking at a map.


      Step 4: Ohio is in the eastern/midwestern part of the United States, while Wyoming
      is in the western part of the United States. Wyoming is definitely west of Ohio.


      Step 5: Since Lake Erie is on the northern border of Ohio, and the Teton Range
      is in western Wyoming, the Teton Range must be west of Lake Erie.


      Therefore, Lake Erie, OH is NOT west of the Teton Range, WY. Rather, Lake Erie
      is EAST of the Teton Range.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two geographic features in the US.


      Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes located on the northern border of Ohio
      (OH) in the northeastern/midwestern United States.

      - The Teton Range is a mountain range located in western Wyoming (WY), part
      of the Rocky Mountains.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on the east-west axis

      - Ohio is in the eastern half of the United States

      - Wyoming is in the western half of the United States, significantly west of
      Ohio

      - Since Lake Erie borders Ohio and the Teton Range is in Wyoming, the lake must
      be east of the mountain range


      Step 3: Make a conclusion

      Since Lake Erie is in the eastern part of the country and the Teton Range is
      in the western part, Lake Erie is east (not west) of the Teton Range.

      1. Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, located in the northeastern United States.
      It borders Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan, and the Canadian province
      of Ontario.


      2. The Teton Range is a mountain range in western Wyoming, part of the Rocky

      To determine which is further west, I need to think about the general east-west
      geography of the United States:

      - The Great Lakes region is in the eastern/northeastern part of the US

      - Wyoming is in the western part of the US, with the Rocky Mountains (including
      the Teton Range) running through it


      Wyoming is definitely west of Ohio, and the Teton Range is in western Wyoming.
      Lake Erie is along the northern border of Ohio.


      So Lake Erie in Ohio would be east of the Teton Range in Wyoming, not west of
      it.</think>I need to determine if Lake Erie, OH is west of the Teton Range,
      WY by comparing their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Consider Lake Erie''s location. Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes
      located in the northeastern United States. It borders Ohio along Ohio''s northern
      edge.


      Step 2: Consider the Teton Range''s location. The Teton Range is a mountain
      range located in western Wyoming, part of the Rocky Mountains.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions. The United States generally has the
      following west-to-east arrangement:

      - Western states (including Wyoming) are closer to the Pacific Ocean

      - Eastern states (including Ohio) are closer to the Atlantic Ocean


      Step 4: Wyoming is substantially west of Ohio on any US map. Since Lake Erie
      borders Ohio and the Teton Range is in Wyoming, Lake Erie must be east of the
      Teton Range, not west.

      relative geographic locations of two US natural features:

      1. Lake Erie, which is located in Ohio (OH) and other states

      2. Teton Range, which is located in Wyoming (WY)


      Let me think about the locations of these places on a US map:


      Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes located in the northeastern/north-central
      United States. It forms part of the border between the US and Canada, and touches
      several states including Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and Michigan. Ohio is
      in the eastern half of the US.


      The Teton Range is a mountain range in Wyoming, which is in the western United
      States. The Tetons are part of the Rocky Mountains and are located in western
      Wyoming, near the Idaho border. Grand Teton National Park contains much of this
      range.


      In terms of east-west orientation in the US:

      - Wyoming is considerably west of Ohio

      - The Teton Range is in western Wyoming

      - Lake Erie is on the eastern edge of Ohio


      So if we''re comparing their east-west positions:

      Lake Erie, OH is in the eastern part of the US

      Teton Range, WY is in the western part of the US


      This means Lake Erie is EAST of the Teton Range, not west of it.</think>I need
      to determine the relative east-west positions of Lake Erie, OH and the Teton
      Range, WY.


      Step 1: Consider Lake Erie''s location. Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes
      located in the northeastern/north-central United States. It borders Ohio on
      its southern shore. Ohio is located in the eastern half of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the Teton Range''s location. The Teton Range is a mountain
      range located in western Wyoming. Wyoming is in the western United States, significantly
      west of Ohio.


      Step 3: Compare their positions. On a west-to-east orientation across the United
      States, Wyoming is considerably west of Ohio. Therefore, the Teton Range in
      western Wyoming is west of Lake Erie.


      Step 4: Answer the specific question. The question asks if Lake Erie is west
      of the Teton Range, which is the opposite of their actual positions.

      1. Lake Erie, which borders Ohio (among other states)

      2. The Teton Range in Wyoming


      I need to determine which one is further west.


      Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes in the northeastern United States. It borders

      Ohio is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region.


      The Teton Range is a mountain range in Wyoming, which is in the western United

      When comparing east-west positions in the US:

      - Wyoming is much further west than Ohio

      - The Teton Range is in western Wyoming

      - Lake Erie is on the eastern edge of Ohio (though it extends to other states
      as well)


      So the Teton Range in Wyoming would be significantly west of Lake Erie.</think>#
      Is Lake Erie, OH located west of Teton Range, WY?


      Let me think about the geographic locations of these two natural features:


      1) Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes located in the northeastern/midwestern
      United States. Ohio borders Lake Erie on its southern shore, along with other
      states like Pennsylvania and New York. Ohio is in the eastern half of the continental
      US.


      2) The Teton Range is a mountain range located in western Wyoming. Wyoming is
      in the western United States, specifically in the Rocky Mountain region.


      3) In terms of east-west positioning, Wyoming is significantly west of Ohio.
      On a map of the United States, Wyoming is several states to the west of Ohio.
