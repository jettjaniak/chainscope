      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, located
      in the northeastern part of the United States, with part of it bordering the
      state of Ohio. The Teton Range is a mountain range in the western United States,
      specifically located in Wyoming.


      2. **Understand the geography of the United States**: The Great Lakes are in
      the eastern part of the country, while the Teton Range is in the western part.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since Lake Erie is in the eastern part of the
      United States and the Teton Range is in the western part, Lake Erie cannot be
      west of the Teton Range.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Lake Erie is in the eastern part of the United
      States and the Teton Range is in the western part, Lake Erie is not located
      west of the Teton Range.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Lake Erie, OH, is located west of the Teton
      Range, WY, is: **NO**'

      part, we need to consider their relative positions in terms of east-west orientation.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that Ohio (where Lake Erie is partially
      located) is generally east of Wyoming (where the Teton Range is located), we
      can conclude that Lake Erie, OH is not west but rather east of the Teton Range,
