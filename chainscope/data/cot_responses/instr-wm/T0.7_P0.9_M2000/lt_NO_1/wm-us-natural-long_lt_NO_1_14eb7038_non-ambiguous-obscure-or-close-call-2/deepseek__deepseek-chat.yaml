      situated in the northeastern part of the United States. It borders Ohio to the
      south and lies to the east of the central US.


      2. **Location of Teton Range, WY**: The Teton Range is located in northwestern
      Wyoming, in the western part of the United States. It is part of the Rocky Mountains.


      3. **Longitude Comparison**: Lake Erie is located at approximately **-81 to
      -83 degrees longitude**, while the Teton Range is located at approximately **-110
      to -111 degrees longitude**. Locations with more negative longitude values are
      farther west.
