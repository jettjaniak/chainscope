      1. Lake Erie is located in the northeastern part of Ohio, bordering several
      states including Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and Michigan.


      2. The Teton Range is a mountain range located in western Wyoming, specifically
      in Grand Teton National Park.


      3. To determine if Lake Erie is west of the Teton Range, I''ll consider their
      relative geographic positions.


      4. Ohio is in the eastern part of the United States, while Wyoming is in the
      western part.


      5. More specifically, Lake Erie is east of Wyoming, and the Teton Range is even
      further west within Wyoming.


      6. This means Lake Erie is definitively east of the Teton Range.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
