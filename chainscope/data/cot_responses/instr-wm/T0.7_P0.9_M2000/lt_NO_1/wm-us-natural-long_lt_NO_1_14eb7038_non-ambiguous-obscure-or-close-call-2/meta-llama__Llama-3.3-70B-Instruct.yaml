      let''s break down the locations and their relative positions in the United States.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Lake Erie is a Great Lake located in the northeastern
      part of the United States, and it borders the state of Ohio among others. The
      Teton Range, on the other hand, is a mountain range in Wyoming, which is in
      the western United States.


      2. **Understand the geography**: The Great Lakes are in the eastern and midwestern
      parts of the United States, with Lake Erie being the southernmost of the Great
      Lakes. The Teton Range is part of the Rocky Mountains, which are in the western
      United States.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that Lake Erie is in the northeastern part
      of the U.S. (specifically bordering Ohio) and the Teton Range is in the western
      U.S. (in Wyoming), we need to determine their relative east-west positions.


      4. **Determine if Lake Erie is west of the Teton Range**: Since Lake Erie is
      located in the eastern part of the United States and the Teton Range is in the
      western part, Lake Erie cannot be west of the Teton Range. Instead, it is east
      of the Teton Range.


      Based on the steps above, the answer to whether Lake Erie, OH, is located west
      of the Teton Range, WY, is **NO**.'

      1. **Identify the locations**: Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, located

      The Teton Range is a mountain range in the western United States, specifically
      located in Wyoming.


      2. **Determine the general geographical direction**: Since Lake Erie is in the
      northeastern part of the United States and the Teton Range is in the western
      part, we need to consider their relative positions in terms of east-west orientation.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that Ohio (where Lake Erie is partially
      located) is generally east of Wyoming (where the Teton Range is located), we
      can conclude that Lake Erie, OH is not west but rather east of the Teton Range,
      WY.


      Based on the step-by-step analysis, the answer to whether Lake Erie, OH is located
      west of the Teton Range, WY is: **NO**'
