      \ of the United States. It borders the state of Ohio to the south.\n\n2. **Location\
      \ of Teton Range, WY**: The Teton Range is a mountain range of the Rocky Mountains,\

      let''s break down the locations and their relative positions in the United States.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Lake Erie is a Great Lake located in the northeastern
      part of the United States, and it borders the state of Ohio among others. The
      Teton Range, on the other hand, is a mountain range in Wyoming, which is in
      the western United States.


      2. **Understand the geography**: The Great Lakes are in the eastern and midwestern
      parts of the United States, with Lake Erie being the southernmost of the Great
      Lakes. The Teton Range is part of the Rocky Mountains, which are in the western
      United States.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that Lake Erie is in the northeastern part
      of the U.S. (specifically bordering Ohio) and the Teton Range is in the western
      U.S. (in Wyoming), we need to determine their relative east-west positions.


      4. **Determine if Lake Erie is west of the Teton Range**: Since Lake Erie is
      located in the eastern part of the United States and the Teton Range is in the
      western part, Lake Erie cannot be west of the Teton Range. Instead, it is east
      of the Teton Range.

      3. **Compare the locations**: Given that Ohio (where Lake Erie is partially

      can conclude that Lake Erie, OH is not west but rather east of the Teton Range,
