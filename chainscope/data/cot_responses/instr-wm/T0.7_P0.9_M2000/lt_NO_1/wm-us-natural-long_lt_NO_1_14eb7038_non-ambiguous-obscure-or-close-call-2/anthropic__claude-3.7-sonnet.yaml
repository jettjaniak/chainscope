      positions of Lake Erie, OH and the Teton Range, WY.


      Step 1: Let me identify the general locations.

      - Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, bordering Ohio (as well as Pennsylvania,
      New York, Michigan, and Ontario, Canada).

      - The Teton Range is a mountain range in western Wyoming.


      Step 2: Consider their positions on the US map.

      - Ohio is in the eastern part of the United States, in the Midwest/Great Lakes
      region.

      - Wyoming is in the western part of the United States, in the Rocky Mountain
      region.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - States in the eastern US (like Ohio) have longitudes further east (higher
      negative numbers or lower positive numbers) than states in the western US (like
      Wyoming).

      - Lake Erie is positioned along the northern border of Ohio, in the eastern
      part of the country.

      - The Teton Range is in western Wyoming, which is significantly further west
      than Ohio.


      Therefore, Lake Erie, OH is located EAST of the Teton Range, WY, not west of
      it.


      NO'

      positions of Lake Erie, OH and the Teton Range, WY.


      Step 1: Let me identify the general locations.

      - Lake Erie borders Ohio on the north side of the state.

      - The Teton Range is located in western Wyoming.


      Step 2: Consider the states'' relative positions.

      - Ohio is in the eastern part of the United States.

      - Wyoming is in the western part of the United States, significantly west of
      Ohio.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within their states.

      - Even though Lake Erie is on the northern edge of Ohio, this doesn''t change
      its east-west position relative to Wyoming.

      - The Teton Range, being in western Wyoming, is even further west than the eastern
      border of Wyoming.


      Step 4: Make the final comparison.

      - Since Ohio is east of Wyoming, and Lake Erie is in Ohio while the Teton Range
      is in Wyoming, Lake Erie must be east of the Teton Range.


      NO, Lake Erie, OH is not located west of Teton Range, WY. It is located east
      of the Teton Range.'

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations mentioned.

      - Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, located in the northeastern United States.
      It borders Ohio (OH) on its southern shore.

      - The Teton Range is a mountain range in Wyoming (WY), located in the western
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west geography of the United States.

      - The eastern United States includes states like Ohio, which borders Lake Erie.

      - The western United States includes states like Wyoming, where the Teton Range
      is located.

      - Generally, Wyoming is significantly west of Ohio.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Lake Erie is in the northeastern/eastern part of the country.

      - The Teton Range is in the western part of the country.

      - Moving from east to west across the US, you would encounter Lake Erie first,
      then much later the Teton Range.


      Step 4: Make the determination about "west of" relationship.

      - Since Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range, Lake Erie is NOT west of the Teton
      Range.


      NO'
