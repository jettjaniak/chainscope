      west of Teton Range, WY, we can break this down into a few steps:


      1. Identify the location of Lake Erie: Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes and
      is located to the north of Ohio. It is situated in the northeastern part of
      the United States.


      2. Identify the location of the Teton Range: The Teton Range is a mountain range
      located in the western part of Wyoming, which is in the northwestern region
      of the United States.


      3. Compare the relative positions: Ohio is located to the east of Wyoming. Therefore,
      Lake Erie, which is in Ohio, is also to the east of the Teton Range in Wyoming.


      Based on this analysis, Lake Erie, OH is located east of the Teton Range, WY.


      The answer is: NO.'

    2f89cde9-c08b-48ff-addf-3e85cc3c81e5: 'To determine whether Lake Erie in Ohio
      is located west of the Teton Range in Wyoming, we need to compare their longitudinal
      positions:


      1. **Location of Lake Erie, OH**: Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes and is
      situated in the northeastern part of Ohio. The approximate longitude for the
      central part of Lake Erie is around 81 to 83 degrees west.


      2. **Location of the Teton Range, WY**: The Teton Range is located in northwestern
      Wyoming. The approximate longitude for the Teton Range is around 110 to 111
