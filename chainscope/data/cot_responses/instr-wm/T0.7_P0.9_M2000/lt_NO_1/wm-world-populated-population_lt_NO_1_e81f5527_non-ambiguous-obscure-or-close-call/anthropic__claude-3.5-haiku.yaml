    f87f0de1-0a65-4dbc-9691-4a6b91de200a: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s find the population of Casablanca:

      - Casablanca is a major city in Morocco

      - Its population is approximately 3.7 million in the urban area


      2. Next, let''s find the population of the Urban agglomeration of Montreal:

      - Montreal is a major city in Canada

      - Its urban agglomeration population is approximately 4.1 million


      3. Comparing the two populations:

      - Casablanca: ~3.7 million

      - Montreal urban agglomeration: ~4.1 million

      - 3.7 million is less than 4.1 million


      4. The question asks: Is Casablanca less populous than Urban agglomeration of
      Montreal?


      Since 3.7 million is indeed less than 4.1 million, the answer is:


      YES'

      1. First, let''s consider Singapore Island:

      - Singapore is a sovereign city-state and island nation

      - Its total population is approximately 5.7 million people (as of 2022)


      2. Now, let''s consider Coney Island:

      - Coney Island is a peninsula in Brooklyn, New York

      - It is not a separate island with its own permanent population

      - Its population is part of Brooklyn''s population

      - The area around Coney Island has a population density, but Coney Island itself
      is mostly a recreational area and amusement park
