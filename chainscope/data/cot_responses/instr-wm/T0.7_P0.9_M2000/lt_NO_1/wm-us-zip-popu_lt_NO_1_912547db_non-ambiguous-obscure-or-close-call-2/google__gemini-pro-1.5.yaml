      11201 corresponds to Brooklyn, NY, and 02554 corresponds to Onset, MA.

      2. **Consider general population density:** Brooklyn is a densely populated
      urban area within New York City. Onset is a much smaller, less densely populated
      coastal town in Massachusetts.

      3. **Infer population difference:**  It is highly likely that a specific zip
      code within Brooklyn (11201) would have a larger population than a zip code
      encompassing a small town like Onset (02554).

      2. **Recognize the need for population data:** To compare populations, we need
      data on how many people live in each zip code.

      3. **Research the populations:**  A quick online search (using a site like the
      U.S. Census Bureau or similar resources) is necessary to find population estimates
      for each zip code.

      Assuming a search reveals 11201 to have a significantly higher population than
      02554 (which is likely, as 11201 is in Brooklyn, NY, a densely populated area,

      is a highly populated urban area. Onset, MA is a much smaller coastal town in
      Massachusetts.  It''s likely Brooklyn has a higher population density and therefore
      the specific zip code would be more populous.

      these specific zip codes from a reliable source like the U.S. Census Bureau.  A
      general comparison of Brooklyn vs. a small Massachusetts town isn''t precise
      enough. *(I can''t access external websites or specific data sources.)*

      wealthy suburban town.  While precise numbers can be difficult to get at the

      significantly higher populations than affluent suburban areas like Atherton.

      Orleans, while a major city, has a considerably lower population density than
      Manhattan.

      10024 corresponds to a zip code in New York City, specifically the Upper East
      Side of Manhattan. 70112 corresponds to a zip code in New Orleans, Louisiana.


      2. **Consider population density:** Manhattan is known for its extremely high
      population density. New Orleans, while a city, has a lower population density
      than Manhattan.


      3. **Reasoning:** Given the drastically higher population density of Manhattan
      compared to New Orleans, it''s highly likely that a zip code in Manhattan (10024)
      would have a larger population than a zip code in New Orleans (70112).
