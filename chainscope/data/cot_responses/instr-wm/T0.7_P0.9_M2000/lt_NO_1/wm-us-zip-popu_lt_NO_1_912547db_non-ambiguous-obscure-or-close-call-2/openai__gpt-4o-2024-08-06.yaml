      1. **94301, CA**: This zip code is located in Palo Alto, California, which is
      part of the San Francisco Bay Area. Palo Alto is known for being a major hub
      in Silicon Valley and is relatively densely populated.


      2. **11954, NY**: This zip code corresponds to Montauk, New York, located at
      the eastern tip of Long Island. Montauk is known as a tourist destination, particularly
      popular in the summer months, but it has a smaller year-round population compared
      to urban areas.


      Based on these characteristics:


      - Palo Alto (94301) is an urban area with a significant population due to its
      location in Silicon Valley.

      - Montauk (11954) is more rural and primarily a seasonal tourist destination,
      with a smaller permanent population.


      Given these considerations, 94301 in Palo Alto, CA, is more populous than 11954
      in Montauk, NY.

      1. **10003, NY**: This zip code covers parts of the East Village, Greenwich
      Village, and Union Square in Manhattan, New York City. These areas are known
      for their high population density due to the urban environment and the presence
      of residential buildings, commercial areas, and cultural attractions.


      2. **33139, FL**: This zip code encompasses South Beach, a neighborhood in Miami
      Beach, Florida. South Beach is a highly popular tourist destination and is densely
      populated, particularly due to its appeal to tourists and residents alike.


      Given the nature of both areas:

      - **10003, NY** is located in Manhattan, which is one of the most densely populated
      places in the United States.

      - **33139, FL** is a significant tourist destination with a high residential
      population but may not match the overall density and residential numbers found
      in Manhattan.


      Considering these factors, it''s reasonable to conclude that 10003, NY, likely
      has a higher population than 33139, FL.
