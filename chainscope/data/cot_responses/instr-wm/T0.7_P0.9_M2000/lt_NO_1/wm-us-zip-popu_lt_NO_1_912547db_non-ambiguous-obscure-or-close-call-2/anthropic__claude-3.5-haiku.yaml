      1. First, I recognize these are zip codes for specific areas in New York (10025)
      and Louisiana (70116).


      2. To compare their populations, I would need to look up demographic data for
      these specific zip codes.


      3. 10025 is in Manhattan, New York City, specifically the Upper West Side area

      4. 70116 is in New Orleans, Louisiana, covering parts of the French Quarter

      York City.
