      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 11201 is in Brooklyn, New York

      Step 2: Consider the characteristics of these locations.

      - Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs of New York City, known to be densely
      populated

      - Nantucket is a small island off the coast of Massachusetts, primarily a seasonal/tourist
      destination


      Step 3: Look at typical population patterns.

      - Brooklyn zip codes typically have tens of thousands of residents

      - Nantucket is much smaller with a year-round population of around 11,000 for
      the entire island


      Step 4: Specific zip code populations.

      - 11201 (Brooklyn Heights/DUMBO area) has approximately 50,000-60,000 residents

      - 02554 (Nantucket) has likely fewer than 10,000 year-round residents

      - Malibu is primarily a spread-out beach community with larger lot sizes and
      lower density housing.


      Step 4: Make a determination based on typical urban vs. coastal community patterns.

      - NYC ZIP codes, especially in Manhattan, generally have significantly higher
      populations than beach communities like Malibu.

      - The West Village, while not the most densely populated part of Manhattan,
      still has urban density far exceeding typical beach communities.

      - 94027 is the zip code for Atherton, California, which is a small, wealthy

      Comparing population:

      - 10001 is in Manhattan, one of the most densely populated areas in the United

      Manhattan including Tribeca and parts of SoHo.

      - 70130 is a zip code in Louisiana, covering parts of New Orleans, including
      portions of the Central Business District and French Quarter.

      - Lower Manhattan (10013) is in New York City, the most populous city in the
      US, and Manhattan is very densely populated.

      - The New Orleans area (70130) is in a much smaller city overall compared to
      NYC, though this specific zip code covers central areas.


      Step 3: Estimate relative populations.

      - Manhattan zip codes, especially in areas like Tribeca/SoHo, typically have
      very high population densities.

      - While 70130 covers central New Orleans areas that are significant, they generally
      don''t match the extreme density of Manhattan neighborhoods.

      - 90028 is in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California

      - 89109 is in Las Vegas, Nevada (includes part of the Las Vegas Strip)


      Step 2: Consider the population characteristics.

      - 90028 (Hollywood) is a dense urban residential and commercial area in Los

      of zip code 55425 in Minnesota is less than the population of zip code 10007
      in New York.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 55425 is a zip code in Minnesota, likely in the Minneapolis-Bloomington area.

      - 10007 is a zip code in New York, specifically in Lower Manhattan in New York
      City.


      Step 2: Consider what I know about these areas.

      - 10007 is in downtown Manhattan, which includes parts of the Financial District,
      an area with high-rise office buildings but relatively fewer residents compared
      to other parts of NYC.

      - 55425 is likely in a suburban area of Minneapolis, which would typically have
      moderate population density.


      Step 3: Consider typical population patterns.

      - Downtown business districts often have fewer residents than suburban residential
      areas.

      - However, Manhattan is extremely dense overall, even in its business districts.

      - Minnesota suburbs typically have lower population density than any part of
      Manhattan.


      Step 4: Make a reasoned judgment.

      - 10007, being in the heart of Manhattan, likely has a higher population density
      but covers a very small area.

      - 55425, being a suburban zip code, likely covers more area but with lower density.

      - Manhattan zip codes, even in business districts, typically have substantial
      residential populations due to high-rise apartment buildings.


      Based on this reasoning, zip code 10007 in Manhattan, New York City likely has
      more residents than zip code 55425 in Minnesota.


      YES, 55425, MN is less populous than 10007, NY.'

      - 55425 appears to be in the Minneapolis area of Minnesota

      - 10007 is in Manhattan, New York City


      Step 3: Think about the population density of these areas.

      - Manhattan (10007) is one of the most densely populated areas in the United
      States, located in the heart of New York City

      - 55425 in Minnesota is likely in a suburban area near Minneapolis, which would
      typically have lower population density than Manhattan


      Step 4: Consider specific characteristics of these zip codes.

      - 10007 covers part of the Financial District in Lower Manhattan, which includes
      both commercial buildings and residential areas

      - 55425 includes parts of Bloomington, MN (based on my knowledge), which is
      less densely populated than Manhattan


      Step 5: Make a reasoned comparison.

      - Manhattan zip codes typically have very high population density

      - Suburban Minnesota areas typically have much lower population density


      Based on this analysis, 55425 in Minnesota is very likely less populous than
      10007 in New York.

      - Manhattan''s Upper West Side (10024) is a densely populated residential area
      in one of America''s most populous cities

      - Downtown New Orleans (70112) includes business districts, some residential
      areas, and parts of the medical district, but is not as densely residential

      Step 4: Compare the approximate populations.

      - ZIP code 10024 (Upper West Side) typically has around 60,000-65,000 residents

      - ZIP code 70112 (Downtown New Orleans) typically has around 10,000-15,000 residents

      Let me think step by step:


      1) 10024 is a ZIP code on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City,
      NY.

      2) 70112 is a ZIP code in New Orleans, Louisiana (LA).

      3) To compare population, I need to consider the residential density of these
      areas.

      4) Manhattan''s Upper West Side (10024) is one of the most densely populated
      residential areas in the US.

      5) 70112 in New Orleans includes parts of the Central Business District and
      medical district, which has fewer full-time residents compared to a primarily
      residential area like the Upper West Side.

      6) New York City ZIP codes, especially in Manhattan, typically have very high
      population densities.

      7) While 70112 is in an urban area (New Orleans), it doesn''t have the same
      residential density as Manhattan neighborhoods.


      Based on these considerations of urban geography and typical population patterns
      in these areas, 10024 in Manhattan would likely have a higher population than
      70112 in New Orleans.

      Step 3: Compare typical population patterns.

      - Manhattan zip codes are generally among the most densely populated in the
      country.

      - While New Orleans has dense areas, they typically don''t reach the population
      density of Manhattan neighborhoods.

      - The Upper West Side (10024) is a primarily residential area with many high-rise
      apartment buildings.

      - The downtown New Orleans area (70112) includes business districts, some residential
      areas, and public facilities.
