    e7b2578d-ee43-4489-aa9d-a0422a2ac695: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Wayne County is in Michigan, which is located in the Midwestern United States.


      2. Cook County is in Illinois, also in the Midwestern United States.


      3. Michigan is east of Illinois on a US map.


      4. Therefore, Wayne County (in Michigan) is east of Cook County (in Illinois).


      5. Since the question asks if Wayne County is west of Cook County, and we know
      it is actually east, the answer is NO.
