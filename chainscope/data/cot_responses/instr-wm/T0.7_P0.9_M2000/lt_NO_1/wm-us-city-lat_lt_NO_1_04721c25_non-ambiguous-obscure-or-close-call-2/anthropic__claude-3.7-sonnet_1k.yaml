      Let me think about the geographic locations of these cities in the United States:


      Seattle is in Washington state, which is in the Pacific Northwest of the United
      States, near the Canadian border.


      Los Angeles is in California, which is on the west coast of the United States,
      south of Washington state.


      Specifically:

      - Seattle is located in the northern part of Washington state

      - Los Angeles is located in the southern part of California


      In terms of north-south positioning:

      - Washington state is north of California

      - Seattle is therefore north of Los Angeles


      So Seattle is NOT south of Los Angeles. Seattle is north of Los Angeles.</think>To
      determine if Seattle, WA is located south of Los Angeles, CA, I need to think
      about the geographic positions of these cities within the United States.


      Step 1: Consider the states. Washington (WA) is a state in the Pacific Northwest
      region, while California (CA) is located along the west coast, south of Washington.


      Step 2: Within these states, Seattle is in the northern part of Washington state,
      near the Canadian border. Los Angeles is in the southern part of California.


      Step 3: Looking at the north-south axis, Washington state is entirely north
      of California, which means Seattle must be north of Los Angeles.

      In terms of north-south positioning:

      the United States.

      - Los Angeles is located in California, specifically in the southern part of
      the state.


      Step 2: Consider their latitudes (which measure north-south position).

      - Seattle is positioned much farther north, near the Canadian border.

      - Los Angeles is positioned in Southern California, much closer to the Mexican
      border.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Seattle is in the northern part of the west coast.

      - Los Angeles is in the southern part of the west coast.

      - When traveling from Seattle to Los Angeles, you would travel southward.

      - When traveling from Los Angeles to Seattle, you would travel northward.


      Therefore, Seattle is located NORTH of Los Angeles, not south of it.

      Seattle is located in Washington state, which is in the Pacific Northwest region

      Los Angeles is located in California, which is on the west coast of the United
      States, bordering Mexico to the south.

      - Going north means moving to higher latitudes (bigger numbers)

      Los Angeles is in California, which is also on the west coast but further south.

      Washington state is entirely north of California. Seattle is in the northern
      part of Washington, while Los Angeles is in the southern part of California.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on these positions.

      Since Seattle is in a state that''s north of California, and specifically Seattle
      is in the northern part of Washington, Seattle must be north of Los Angeles.
