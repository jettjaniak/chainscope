      the United States.


      2. Denver is located in Colorado, which is in the western part of the United
      States.

      \n5. Chicago is at approximately 41.8781\xB0 N latitude.\n\n6. Atlanta is at\
      \ approximately 33.7490\xB0 N latitude.\n\n7. Since Chicago's latitude is higher\
      \ (further north) than Atlanta's latitude, Chicago is NORTH of Atlanta.\n\n\
      8. Therefore, Chicago is NOT south of Atlanta.\n\nAnswer: NO"

    057a033b-8c29-4e39-9f44-a23c4a4e62bc: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s locate Yosemite Valley, CA:

      - Yosemite Valley is in California, in the western part of the United States

      - California is a western state


      2. Next, let''s locate Nashville, TN:

      - Nashville is in Tennessee, which is in the southeastern part of the United
      States


      3. Comparing their latitudes:

      - California is west of Tennessee

      - California is generally at a more northern latitude than Tennessee

      - Yosemite Valley specifically is quite far north in California


      4. So if Yosemite Valley is north of Nashville''s latitude, it cannot be south
      of Nashville.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO'
