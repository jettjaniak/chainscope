      1. First, let''s consider the geographical locations of Denver and Orlando in
      the United States.


      2. Denver is located in Colorado, which is in the western part of the United
      States.

      \n5. Chicago is at approximately 41.8781\xB0 N latitude.\n\n6. Atlanta is at\
      \ approximately 33.7490\xB0 N latitude.\n\n7. Since Chicago's latitude is higher\
      \ (further north) than Atlanta's latitude, Chicago is NORTH of Atlanta.\n\n\
      8. Therefore, Chicago is NOT south of Atlanta.\n\nAnswer: NO"

    057a033b-8c29-4e39-9f44-a23c4a4e62bc: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s locate Yosemite Valley, CA:

      - Yosemite Valley is in California, in the western part of the United States

      - California is a western state


      2. Next, let''s locate Nashville, TN:

      - Nashville is in Tennessee, which is in the southeastern part of the United
      States


      3. Comparing their latitudes:

      - California is west of Tennessee

      - California is generally at a more northern latitude than Tennessee

      - Yosemite Valley specifically is quite far north in California


      4. So if Yosemite Valley is north of Nashville''s latitude, it cannot be south
      of Nashville.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO'
