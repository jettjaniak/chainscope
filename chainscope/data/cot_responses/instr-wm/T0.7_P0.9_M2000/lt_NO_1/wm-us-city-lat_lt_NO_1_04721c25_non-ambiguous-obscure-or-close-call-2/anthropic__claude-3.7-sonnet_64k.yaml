      WA is located south of Los Angeles, CA. Let me think about the geographic locations
      of these two cities.


      Seattle is located in Washington state, which is in the Pacific Northwest of
      the United States. Washington state borders Canada to the north and Oregon to
      the south.


      Los Angeles is located in California state, which is on the west coast of the
      United States. California is south of Oregon.


      So the order from north to south is:

      - Washington state (where Seattle is)

      - Oregon

      - California (where Los Angeles is)


      This means that Seattle is located north of Los Angeles, not south of it.


      So the answer is NO, Seattle is not located south of Los Angeles. Seattle is
      north of Los Angeles.</think>To answer this question, I need to consider the

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both cities.

      - Seattle is located in Washington state, in the Pacific Northwest region of
      the United States.

      - Los Angeles is located in California, on the west coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider their positions relative to each other.

      - Washington state is north of California on the west coast.

      - The west coast states from north to south are: Washington, Oregon, then California.


      Step 3: Compare the specific city locations.

      - Seattle is in the northern part of Washington state.

      - Los Angeles is in the southern half of California.


      Therefore, Seattle is positioned significantly north of Los Angeles, not south
      of it.
