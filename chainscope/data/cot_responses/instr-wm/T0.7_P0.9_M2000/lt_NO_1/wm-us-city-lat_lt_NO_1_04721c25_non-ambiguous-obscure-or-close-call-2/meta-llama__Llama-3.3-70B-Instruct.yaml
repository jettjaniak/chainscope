      PA is located south of Washington, DC, let''s consider the geographical locations
      of both cities.


      1. **Identify the general location of each city**: Philadelphia is in the state
      of Pennsylvania, and Washington, DC is the capital district, not part of any
      state but located between Maryland and Virginia.


      2. **Consider the north-south orientation**: Generally, the northeastern United
      States includes states like Pennsylvania, New York, and Massachusetts, while
      states like Florida, Texas, and California are in the south or southwest.


      3. **Specific locations of Philadelphia and Washington, DC**: Philadelphia is
      in southeastern Pennsylvania. Washington, DC is situated just south of Maryland,
      directly on the Potomac River, which forms the border between Maryland and Virginia.


      4. **Compare their positions**: Philadelphia, PA is north of Washington, DC
      because Pennsylvania is located north of both Maryland and Virginia, where Washington,
      DC is positioned.


      Based on these steps, the conclusion is that Philadelphia, PA is not south of
      Washington, DC; it is actually north.

      let''s break down the steps of reasoning needed:


      1. **Identify the locations**: We need to know the locations of Philadelphia,
      PA, and Washington, D.C.

      2. **Determine their relative positions**: Specifically, we need to figure out
      if Philadelphia is south of Washington, D.C.

      3. **Use geographical knowledge or references**: Knowing the general geography
      of the East Coast of the United States can help. Washington, D.C. is located
      near the southern part of the state of Maryland, close to the border with Virginia.
      Philadelphia, PA, is located in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania.

      4. **Compare latitudes**: A more precise method to determine their relative
      positions is by comparing their latitudes. Latitude is a measure of distance
      north or south of the Equator. The city with the lower latitude is located south
      of the city with the higher latitude.

      5. **Apply knowledge of US geography**: Philadelphia, PA, is generally known
      to be northeast of Washington, D.C., based on the geography of the northeastern
      United States.


      Given these steps, we can determine that Philadelphia, PA, is not south of Washington,
      D.C., but rather north and slightly east.


      The answer is: NO'
