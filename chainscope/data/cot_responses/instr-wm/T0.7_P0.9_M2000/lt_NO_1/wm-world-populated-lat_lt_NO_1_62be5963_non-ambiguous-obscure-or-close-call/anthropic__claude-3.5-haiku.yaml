    c4f037af-3147-4c6f-963d-6b32f89500a5: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s recall the geographic location of Los Angeles and San Diego
      in California.


      2. Both cities are located in Southern California, along the Pacific coast.


      3. San Diego is located in the southernmost part of California, near the border
      with Mexico.


      4. Los Angeles is located north of San Diego along the California coastline.


      5. If you were to draw a line from north to south on a map of California, Los
      Angeles would be positioned north of San Diego.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, Los Angeles is NOT located south of San Diego.'
