      6. Since Johns Hopkins is east of Chicago, it is NOT west of the University
      of Chicago


      Answer: NO'
    e193ba44-0bfc-469f-b2e7-4701ec5edf16: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland (east coast)


      2. University of Chicago is located in Chicago, Illinois (midwest, specifically
      in the eastern part of Illinois)


      3. Baltimore, MD is east of Chicago, IL

      \ let's locate the states:\n\u2022 University of Virginia is in Virginia (VA)\n\
      \u2022 University of Georgia is in Georgia (GA)\n\n2. Virginia is located in\
      \ the eastern part of the United States\n\u2022 It is part of the Mid-Atlantic\
      \ region\n\u2022 Its coordinates are roughly around 37\xB0N latitude, 78\xB0\
      W longitude\n\n3. Georgia is located in the southeastern part of the United\
      \ States\n\u2022 It is further south and east compared to Virginia\n\u2022 Its\
      \ coordinates are roughly around 33\xB0N latitude, 83\xB0W longitude\n\n4. Comparing\
      \ their geographical positions:\n\u2022 Virginia is more north and slightly\
      \ west of Georgia\n\u2022 This means the University of Virginia is geographically\
