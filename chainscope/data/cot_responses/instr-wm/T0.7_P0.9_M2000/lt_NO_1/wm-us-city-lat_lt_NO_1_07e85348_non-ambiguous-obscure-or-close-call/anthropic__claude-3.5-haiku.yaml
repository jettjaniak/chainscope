      \ if Philadelphia is south of Atlanta, we need to compare their latitudes.\n\
      \n5. Philadelphia's latitude is approximately 39.9\xB0 N.\n\n6. Atlanta's latitude\
      \ is approximately 33.7\xB0 N.\n\n7. Since Philadelphia's latitude is higher\
      \ (more northward) than Atlanta's latitude, Philadelphia is actually NORTH of\
      \ Atlanta, not south.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: NO."
