      \ in Manhattan, one of the most densely populated urban areas in the United\
      \ States, it is likely to have a very high population density.\n   - 02554,\
      \ while in a populated region, is less likely to match the extreme density of\
      \ Manhattan.\n\nBased on these steps and general knowledge, it's reasonable\
      \ to deduce that 10023, NY is more densely populated than 02554, MA, due to\
      \ its location in Manhattan, one of the most densely populated areas in the\
      \ US.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether 10023, NY is less densely populated\
      \ than 02554, MA is: **NO**"
