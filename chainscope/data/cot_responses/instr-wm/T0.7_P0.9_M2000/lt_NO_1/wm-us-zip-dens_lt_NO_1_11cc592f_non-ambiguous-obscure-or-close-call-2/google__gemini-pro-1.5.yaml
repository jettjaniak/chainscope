    0a783f38-4a1c-4273-bf0f-9c61ff3a330f: '1. **Identify the locations:**
      90210 is Beverly Hills, California, a wealthy and relatively densely populated
      area. 11954 is Sag Harbor, New York, a town in the Hamptons, also relatively
      wealthy but likely with more open space than Beverly Hills.


      2. **Consider density factors:** Beverly Hills is known for its tightly packed
      luxury homes and high-rise buildings, suggesting high population density. Sag
      Harbor, while having expensive properties, is likely to have larger plots of
      land and more open areas, suggesting lower population density.


      3. **Compare likely densities:**  Beverly Hills is likely more densely populated
      than Sag Harbor.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

      and large properties, suggesting lower population density. Sag Harbor, while
      also relatively affluent, is a village in the Hamptons, which tends to have
      a mix of housing densities.  It''s likely less spread out than Beverly Hills.

      90210 is Beverly Hills, California. 11954 is Sag Harbor, New York.

      2. **Consider population density:** Population density refers to the number

      also known for large properties, but perhaps less concentrated wealth.

      3. **Hypothesize:**  Beverly Hills *might* be less dense due to larger lot sizes
      for homes.  However, it''s also a city center with apartments and businesses,
      which could increase density. Sag Harbor is likely more spread out, but with
      less commercial development.

      higher population density than Sag Harbor.

      90210 is Beverly Hills, California. 11954 is Sag Harbor, New York.

      2. **Consider population density:** Population density is a measure of people
      per unit of area.  Beverly Hills is a city known for its affluence and likely
      has larger lots and more open space than a typical city. Sag Harbor is a village
      in the Hamptons, also known for large properties and wealth.

      3. **Hypothesize:**  Both areas likely have lower population densities than
      major city centers. However, Sag Harbor, being a smaller village within a less
      densely populated overall region (Long Island outside NYC) than Los Angeles
      County, might be less dense than Beverly Hills.

      4. **Research (optional, but ideal for accuracy):** A quick search could confirm
      this.  While finding exact current figures might be difficult without specific
      data sources, general comparisons should suffice.


      5. **Conclusion:**  Likely YES, 90210 is less densely populated than 11954.  (While
      both are affluent areas, Beverly Hills is part of a much larger and denser urban
      area than Sag Harbor.)  Further research would be needed to confirm definitively.

      2. **Consider the nature of these locations:** Beverly Hills is a famously affluent
      and densely populated urban area. Sag Harbor, while a popular and relatively

      90210 refers to Beverly Hills, California, a wealthy and relatively low-density
      residential area. 11954 refers to Sag Harbor, New York, a town in the Hamptons,
      also known for being affluent with a mix of residential areas, including some
      larger estates.


      2. **Consider population density factors:**  While both are affluent areas,
      Beverly Hills is known for its large lots and single-family homes.  Sag Harbor,
      while having some larger properties, likely has a more varied mix of housing,
      potentially including some higher-density areas.

      urban area. 11954 corresponds to Sag Harbor, New York, a village located at
      the eastern end of Long Island.


      2. **Consider factors influencing population density:**  Population density
      is influenced by factors such as land area and total population. Wealthy areas
      often have larger properties and lower density, even within urban environments.  Sag
      Harbor, while not a major city, is likely to have a mix of housing types and
      potentially higher density compared to a wealthy area known for large estates.


      3. **Formulate a hypothesis:** Beverly Hills (90210) is likely less densely
      populated than Sag Harbor (11954).

      zip code.

      3. **Realize we need external data:** We can''t determine population density

      Long Island where 11976 is located) tend to be more densely populated than many
      areas of California, even coastal ones like 90291 (Venice, CA). While Venice
      Beach is a bustling area, Long Island zip codes often represent suburban communities
      with tighter housing.
