      1. First, 10007 is a zip code in Lower Manhattan, New York City

      - Manhattan is extremely densely populated

      - This is a downtown/financial district zip code

      - Very compact urban area with many high-rise buildings


      2. 90028 is a zip code in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California

      - Hollywood is also a dense urban area

      - But it has somewhat more spread-out buildings compared to Manhattan

      - Less vertical density than Manhattan


      3. Comparing population density:

      - Manhattan is one of the most densely populated areas in the United States

      - Lower Manhattan specifically is extremely compact

      - Hollywood, while dense, has lower population density per square mile


      4. Specific comparison:

      - 10007 zip code area is extremely dense

      - 90028 zip code area is less dense by comparison


      Therefore, the answer is: NO (10007, NY is NOT less densely populated than 90028,
