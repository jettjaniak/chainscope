      in California is less densely populated than 11954 in New York, we need to consider
      the population density of each area. Population density is typically calculated
      as the number of people per square mile.


      **Step 1: Identify the areas represented by the zip codes.**

      - 90210 is primarily associated with Beverly Hills, California.

      - 11954 is associated with Montauk, New York.


      **Step 2: Consider the characteristics of each location.**

      - Beverly Hills (90210) is an urban area known for its affluent residential
      neighborhoods and commercial districts. Urban areas typically have higher population
      densities.

      - Montauk (11954) is a hamlet at the eastern tip of Long Island, known for its
      beaches, state parks, and more rural, spread-out residential areas. Rural areas
      typically have lower population densities.


      **Step 3: Research or recall data on population density if available.**

      - Beverly Hills has a relatively high population density due to its urban setting.

      - Montauk, being more rural and less developed, generally has a lower population
      density.


      **Conclusion:**

      Given that Beverly Hills is an urban area and Montauk is more rural, it is reasonable
      to conclude that 90210 is more densely populated than 11954.

      \   - Manhattan is one of the most densely populated areas in the United States,\
      \ with thousands of people per square mile.\n   - Nantucket, being an island\
      \ and a more rural area, generally has a lower population density compared to\
      \ urban areas like Manhattan.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that Manhattan\
      \ (where 10023 is located) has one of the highest population densities in the\
      \ country and that Nantucket (where 02554 is located) is less densely populated,\
      \ it is reasonable to conclude that 10023 is more densely populated than 02554.\n\
      \nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Is 10023, NY less densely populated\
      \ than 02554, MA?\" is **NO**."
    cf58185a-2aac-4623-a250-d9ed58188085: "To determine whether the zip code 10023\
      \ in New York is less densely populated than 02554 in Massachusetts, we need\
      \ to consider the population density of both areas.\n\n1. **Identify the Locations:**\n\
      \   - 10023 is a zip code in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City.\n\
      \   - 02554 is a zip code for Nantucket, Massachusetts.\n\n2. **Consider Typical\
      \ Population Density:**\n   - Manhattan is known for its high population density,\
      \ with thousands of people per square mile.\n   - Nantucket, being an island\
      \ and known for its seasonal population fluctuations, typically has a lower\
      \ population density compared to urban areas like Manhattan.\n\n3. **Research\
      \ and Compare:**\n   - According to available data, zip code 10023 in Manhattan\
      \ has a very high population density due to the urban environment and residential\
      \ buildings.\n   - Zip code 02554, covering Nantucket, has a significantly lower\
      \ population density. Even at peak tourist seasons, it does not reach the density\
      \ levels of Manhattan neighborhoods.\n\nBased on these considerations, the answer\
      \ is:\n\n**NO**, 10023, NY is not less densely populated than 02554, MA."
