      2. Let me recall what I know about these areas:

      - Venice is a densely populated beachfront neighborhood in Los Angeles

      - Water Mill is a small, affluent hamlet in Southampton, known for being a relatively
      sparse, rural/suburban area

      4. Comparing the numbers:

      11,000+ per sq mile > 400 per sq mile

      1. 10023 is a zip code in Manhattan''s Upper West Side, New York

      2. 02554 is a zip code in Nantucket, Massachusetts


      3. Manhattan''s Upper West Side (10023):

      - Is an urban area in one of the most densely populated parts of NYC

      - Contains many high-rise residential buildings

      - Has approximately 60,000 people per square mile


      4. Nantucket (02554):

      - Is an island community

      - Mostly consists of single-family homes and seasonal residences

      - Has approximately 250 people per square mile


      5. Comparing the population densities:

      60,000 people/sq mile (10023) vs 250 people/sq mile (02554)

      10023 is clearly much more densely populated


      NO - 10023, NY is not less densely populated than 02554, MA. It is actually
      much more densely populated.'
