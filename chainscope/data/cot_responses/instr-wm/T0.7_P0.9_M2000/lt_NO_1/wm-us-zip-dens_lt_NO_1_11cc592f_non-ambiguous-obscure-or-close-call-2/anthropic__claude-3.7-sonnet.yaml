      - 90210 is Beverly Hills, California

      - 11954 is Mattituck, New York


      Step 2: Consider what I know about population density in these areas.

      - Beverly Hills (90210) is a wealthy residential area in Los Angeles County,
      known for large homes on spacious lots and a relatively low population density
      for an urban area.

      - Mattituck (11954) is a small hamlet on the North Fork of Long Island, NY,
      with a rural/suburban character.


      Step 3: Compare the characteristics.

      - Beverly Hills is part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area but maintains lower
      density due to large lot sizes and zoning for luxury homes.

      - Mattituck is a much more rural area with farmland, vineyards, and scattered
      residential development.


      Step 4: Make a determination based on typical population patterns.

      - Despite being in a major metropolitan area, Beverly Hills has intentionally
      maintained lower density through zoning.

      - However, Mattituck is significantly more rural with much more open space and
      agricultural land.


      Based on these considerations, Mattituck (11954, NY) is likely to be less densely
      populated than Beverly Hills (90210, CA).

    1d65af61-d8dc-48aa-aebb-10d08c4f70eb: 'I''ll solve this step by step to determine
      which zip code is more densely populated.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10023 is a zip code in New York, NY (specifically in Manhattan''s Upper West
      Side)

      - 02554 is a zip code in Massachusetts, MA (specifically in Nantucket)


      Step 2: Consider population density characteristics.

      - 10023 is in Manhattan, which is known for being extremely densely populated
      with high-rise apartment buildings and urban development

      - 02554 is in Nantucket, which is an island with primarily vacation homes, seasonal
      population, and much more spread-out development


      Step 3: Compare typical population densities.

      - Manhattan zip codes typically have population densities of tens of thousands
      of people per square mile

      - Nantucket is much more sparsely populated, with likely under 2,000 people
      per square mile


      Step 4: Make a determination.

      Based on these characteristics, 10023 in Manhattan would have a significantly
      higher population density than 02554 in Nantucket.


      NO (10023, NY is NOT less densely populated than 02554, MA)'

      - 10023 is in Manhattan, which is one of the most densely populated urban areas
      in the United States

      - 02554 is on Nantucket Island, which is a vacation destination with a relatively
      small year-round population spread across an island


      Step 3: Compare typical density patterns.

      - Manhattan zip codes typically have extremely high population densities (often
      exceeding 50,000 people per square mile)

      - Nantucket is a relatively rural/suburban island community with much lower
      density


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on these facts.

      - 10023 (Manhattan) would have significantly higher population density than
      02554 (Nantucket)
