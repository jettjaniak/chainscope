      1. First, let''s recall the location of the Atlantic Ocean:

      - The Atlantic Ocean is located between the Americas to the west and Europe
      and Africa to the east

      - It spans from the Arctic Ocean in the north to Antarctica in the south


      2. Now, let''s consider the location of the South China Sea:

      - The South China Sea is located in Southeast Asia

      - It is part of the Pacific Ocean

      - It is east of countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines

      - It is west of the Pacific Ocean
