      1. First, I''ll find the page count for Stephen King''s The Dark Tower V: Wolves
      of the Calla

      - This book is approximately 714 pages long


      2. Next, I''ll find the page count for Tomi Adeyemi''s Children of Blood and

      3. Compare the page counts:

      - The Dark Tower V is 714 pages

      - Children of Blood and Bone is 531 pages

      - 714 is LARGER than 531


      4. The question asks: Is The Dark Tower V shorter than Children of Blood and
      Bone?

      - Since 714 is NOT shorter than 531, the answer is NO

      - "It" is a very long novel

      - It''s one of King''s longest and most substantial works


      2. Next, I''ll check the length of Janet Evanovich''s "One for the Money":

      - This is a relatively short mystery/comedy novel

      - It''s typically around 300-350 pages

      - It''s a quick, light read compared to most of King''s works


      3. Comparing the two:

      - "It" is significantly longer than "One for the Money"
