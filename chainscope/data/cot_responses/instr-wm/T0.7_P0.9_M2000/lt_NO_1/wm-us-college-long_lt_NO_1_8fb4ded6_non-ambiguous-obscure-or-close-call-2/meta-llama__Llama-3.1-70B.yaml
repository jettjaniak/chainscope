      States.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since both universities are located in the eastern
      part of the United States, we need to consider their specific locations within
      their respective states to determine which one is west.


      4. **Compare the specific locations**: Cambridge, Massachusetts, is generally
      considered to be east of Syracuse, New York. This is because Cambridge is located
      closer to the Atlantic Ocean, while Syracuse is more inland.


      Therefore, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is not west of Syracuse
      University.
