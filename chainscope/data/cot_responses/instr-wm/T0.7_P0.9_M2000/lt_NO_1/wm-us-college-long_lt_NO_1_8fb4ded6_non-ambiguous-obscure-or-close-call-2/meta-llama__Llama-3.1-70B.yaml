      States.


      2. **Identify the location of Syracuse University**: Syracuse University is

      States.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since both universities are located in the eastern
      part of the United States, we need to consider their specific locations within
      their respective states to determine which one is west.


      4. **Compare the specific locations**: Cambridge, Massachusetts, is generally
      considered to be east of Syracuse, New York. This is because Cambridge is located
      closer to the Atlantic Ocean, while Syracuse is more inland.


      Therefore, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is not west of Syracuse
      University.

      \n1. **Identify the locations**:\n   - Graduate School of Duke University: Located\
      \ in Durham, North Carolina.\n   - University of Texas at Austin College of\
      \ Liberal Arts: Located in Austin, Texas.\n\n2. **Determine the general geographical\
      \ direction**:\n   - North Carolina (Duke University) is generally east of Texas\
      \ (University of Texas at Austin).\n\n3. **Compare the longitudes**:\n   - Duke\
      \ University (Durham, NC) has a longitude of approximately 78.9\xB0 W.\n   -\
      \ University of Texas at Austin (Austin, TX) has a longitude of approximately\
      \ 97.7\xB0 W.\n\nSince Duke University is at 78.9\xB0 W and the University of\
      \ Texas at Austin is at 97.7\xB0 W, Duke University is east of the University\
      \ of Texas at Austin because it has a smaller longitude value, indicating it\
      \ is farther east.\n\nGiven these steps, the answer to whether the Graduate\
      \ School of Duke University, NC is located west of the University of Texas at\
      \ Austin College of Liberal Arts, TX is:\n\nNO"
