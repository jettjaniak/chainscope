      step.


      Step 1: I need to determine the locations of both institutions.

      - University of Chicago is in Chicago, Illinois (IL)

      - California Institute of Technology (Caltech) is in Pasadena, California (CA)


      Step 2: I need to determine their relative geographic positions in terms of
      east-west orientation.

      - The United States generally has states arranged with the west coast (including
      California) on the left (west) side of the country, and then as you move right
      (east), you encounter states like Illinois.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Illinois is in the midwest region, significantly east of California


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Since California is on the west coast and Illinois is in the midwest, California
      is west of Illinois.

      - Therefore, Caltech (in California) is west of the University of Chicago (in
      Illinois).

      - Conversely, the University of Chicago is east of Caltech.


      The question asks if the University of Chicago is west of Caltech, which is
      not true - it''s east of Caltech.</think>To answer this question, I need to

      - California Institute of Technology (Caltech) is located in Pasadena, California
      (CA).


      Step 2: Determine their relative east-west positions.

      - On a US map, California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region, significantly east of California.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Since California is on the west coast and Illinois is in the Midwest, Caltech
      (in California) is west of the University of Chicago (in Illinois).

      - Therefore, the University of Chicago is east of Caltech, not west.

      geographical positions of College of the University of Chicago, IL and California
      Institute of Technology (Caltech), CA.


      Let''s break this down:

      1. The University of Chicago is located in Chicago, Illinois (IL).

      2. California Institute of Technology (Caltech) is located in Pasadena, California
      (CA).


      Now I need to determine which is further west.


      The United States spans from east to west, with the East Coast being on the
      Atlantic Ocean and the West Coast being on the Pacific Ocean.


      Illinois is in the Midwest region, while California is on the West Coast.


      Going from east to west across the continental US, you would encounter:

      - East Coast states

      - Midwest states (including Illinois)

      - Mountain states

      - West Coast states (including California)


      Therefore, California is west of Illinois. Since the University of Chicago is
      in Illinois and Caltech is in California, Caltech is west of the University
      of Chicago.


      So, is the University of Chicago west of Caltech? No, it''s the opposite. Caltech
      is west of the University of Chicago.</think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the geographical locations of both institutions and compare their
      positions east-to-west.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both colleges.

      - College of the University of Chicago is located in Chicago, Illinois (IL)

      - California Institute of Technology (Caltech) is located in Pasadena, California
      (CA)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on the U.S. map.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - California is on the West Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Moving west across the continental United States, you would encounter Illinois
      before California

      - California is the westernmost state on the U.S. mainland, while Illinois is
      much further east


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on this geographical relationship.

      - Since California is west of Illinois, California Institute of Technology is
      west of the University of Chicago, not the other way around

      locations of these two universities.


      Florida State University is located in Tallahassee, Florida, which is in the
      southeastern United States.


      University of Phoenix is headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, which is in the
      southwestern United States.


      When we consider locations in the United States in terms of east and west, we
      typically refer to their relative longitudes. States that are further east have
      larger (more positive) longitude values, while states that are further west
      have smaller (more negative) longitude values.


      Florida is on the east coast of the United States, while Arizona is in the western
      part of the country. Therefore, Florida (including Tallahassee where Florida
      State University is located) is east of Arizona (including Phoenix where the
      University of Phoenix is located).


      So, Florida State University is located east of University of Phoenix, not west.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of

      - Florida is on the east coast of the United States

      - Arizona is in the southwestern part of the United States


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      - States on the east coast (like Florida) are east of states in the southwest
      (like Arizona)

      - Moving from Arizona to Florida means traveling eastward, not westward


      NO


      Florida State University is not west of University of Phoenix. It''s actually
      east of it, as Florida is located on the eastern side of the United States while
      Arizona is located in the western portion.'

      3) Florida is on the eastern side of the United States

      First, let me think about the geographical locations of these two states:

      - Florida is on the east coast of the United States

      - Arizona is in the southwestern part of the United States


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - Florida is further east in the United States

      - Arizona is further west in the United States


      So Florida State University (being in Florida) would be east of University of

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Florida State University is in Tallahassee, Florida

      - University of Phoenix is in Phoenix, Arizona


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positioning of Florida and Arizona within
      the United States.

      - Florida is located on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern part of the country


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis (longitude).

      - Florida is significantly further east in the continental United States

      - Arizona is positioned much further west


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Florida is east of Arizona on the map of the United States, Florida State
      University must be east of (not west of) the University of Phoenix.

      To answer this, I need to recall the relative positions of Florida and Arizona
      in the United States:


      - Florida is on the southeastern coast of the United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States, bordering California to the
      west and New Mexico to the east.


      When considering east-west positioning in the US:

      - States on the east coast (like Florida) are eastern states

      Arizona is located in the southwestern United States. It''s landlocked but is
      quite far west in the country, bordering California on its western edge.


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - Florida is roughly around 80-87 degrees West longitude

      - Arizona is roughly around 109-114 degrees West longitude


      Since degrees of western longitude increase as you move westward from the prime

      Let me reason through this step by step:


      1) The School of International and Public Affairs is part of Columbia University,
      which is located in Manhattan, New York City, in the southeastern part of New
      York State.


      2) Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine is located in Ithaca, New
      York, which is in the central/western part of New York State.


      3) Geographically, Ithaca (Cornell) is west of Manhattan (Columbia) in New York
      State.


      4) Since Cornell is west of Columbia, Columbia cannot be west of Cornell.

      To determine which one is more west (or east), I need to identify their locations:


      Columbia University is located in New York City, specifically in Manhattan''s
      Morningside Heights neighborhood. The School of International and Public Affairs
      would be on Columbia''s main campus.


      Cornell University''s main campus is in Ithaca, NY, which is in the Finger Lakes
      region in upstate New York. The College of Veterinary Medicine would be on Cornell''s
      main campus in Ithaca.


      Now I need to determine which is further west. Looking at a mental map of New
      York state:

      - New York City is in the southeastern part of New York state

      - Ithaca is in the central/western part of New York state


      Generally speaking, Ithaca is west of New York City. Therefore, Cornell University
      (in Ithaca) would be west of Columbia University (in NYC).

      Virginia is generally east of Tennessee on a map of the United States. Virginia
      borders the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern side, while Tennessee is further inland.


      If we look at a map:

      - Virginia is positioned to the east of Tennessee

      - Even though Virginia Tech is in western Virginia, it would still be east of
      most of Tennessee

      - Nashville, where Vanderbilt is located, is in the central part of Tennessee


      Therefore, Virginia Tech would be east of Vanderbilt University, not west of
      it.</think>I need to determine the geographic locations of these two universities
      and compare them.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Virginia Tech is in Blacksburg, Virginia, in the western part of the state.

      - Vanderbilt University is in Nashville, Tennessee, in the central part of that
      state.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of Virginia and Tennessee.

      - Generally, Virginia is east of Tennessee on the U.S. map.

      - Virginia borders the Atlantic Ocean on its east side, while Tennessee is more
      inland.


      Step 3: Determine east-west positioning.

      - Even though Virginia Tech is in western Virginia, the entire state of Virginia
      is positioned east of Tennessee.

      - Nashville (Vanderbilt''s location) is in central Tennessee.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Virginia Tech must be east of Vanderbilt University, not west.

      - Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland (MD), which is
      on the east coast of the United States

      - Stanford University is located in Stanford, California (CA), which is on the
      west coast of the United States


      In the United States, the states on the east coast (like Maryland) are east
      of the states on the west coast (like California). This is because the continental
      United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific Ocean
      on the west.


      So Johns Hopkins University in Maryland is east of Stanford University in California,
      not west of it.</think>To determine if Johns Hopkins University is located west
      of Stanford University, I need to consider their geographical locations in the
      United States.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland (MD), which is
      on the east coast of the United States.

      - Stanford University is located in Stanford, California (CA), which is on the
      west coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the continental United States.

      - The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west).

      - Maryland is an east coast state near the Atlantic Ocean.

      - California is a west coast state along the Pacific Ocean.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - California is located significantly west of Maryland on any US map.

      - Moving from Maryland to California requires traveling westward across the
      country.


      NO, Johns Hopkins University is not located west of Stanford University. It
      is located east of Stanford University.'

      - Maryland is an East Coast state bordering the Atlantic Ocean.

      - California is a West Coast state bordering the Pacific Ocean.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

    6f7cbbb4-9ce6-4230-a4c8-3d7c8dececa2: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to think about the geographical locations of University of Virginia (in Virginia)
      and Texas A&M University (in Texas).


      First, let me consider the general geographic position of these states:

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the United States

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the United States, bordering the Gulf
      of Mexico


      In terms of east-west positioning, Virginia is significantly east of Texas.
      On a map of the US, Virginia is several states to the east of Texas.


      Since University of Virginia is in Virginia (specifically in Charlottesville,
      VA) and Texas A&M is in Texas (specifically in College Station, TX), the University
      of Virginia would be east of Texas A&M, not west.


      So the answer is NO, University of Virginia is not located west of Texas A&M
      University. It''s actually east of Texas A&M.</think>I need to determine the
      east-west relationship between these two universities.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Virginia is located in Charlottesville, Virginia

      - Texas A&M University is located in College Station, Texas


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of Virginia and Texas.

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the United States

      - Texas is in the south-central United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions (east-west).

      - Virginia is significantly east of Texas on the US map

      - All of Virginia is east of all of Texas


      Step 4: Since the universities are in their respective states, University of
      Virginia must be east of Texas A&M University, not west of it.


      NO, University of Virginia is not located west of Texas A&M University. It is
      located east of it.'

      to determine the geographic locations of the University of Virginia (UVA) in
      Virginia and Texas A&M University in Texas, and compare their east-west positions.


      1. The University of Virginia is located in Charlottesville, Virginia, which
      is on the eastern side of the United States.

      2. Texas A&M University is located in College Station, Texas, which is in the
      southern central part of the United States.


      In terms of longitude (east-west position):

      - Virginia is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Texas is significantly west of Virginia


      So if we''re asking if UVA is west of Texas A&M, we need to determine if Virginia
      is west of Texas, which it is not. Virginia is east of Texas on a map of the
      United States.


      Therefore, the University of Virginia is NOT located west of Texas A&M University.
      It is located EAST of Texas A&M University.</think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Virginia (UVA) is located in Charlottesville, Virginia

      - Texas A&M University is located in College Station, Texas


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states on the US map.

      - Virginia is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Texas is in the south-central part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes (east-west positions).

      - Virginia is significantly east of Texas on the US map

      - All of Virginia is east of all of Texas


      Step 4: Since the University of Virginia is in Virginia (east) and Texas A&M
      is in Texas (west), UVA must be east of Texas A&M, not west.


      NO'

      of Virginia (UVA) is located west of Texas A&M University, I need to compare
      their geographic locations, specifically their longitudes.


      University of Virginia is located in Charlottesville, Virginia, which is on
      the east coast of the United States.


      Texas A&M University is located in College Station, Texas, which is in the southern
      central part of the United States.


      Comparing these two locations:

      - Virginia is on the east coast

      - Texas is in the central/southern region, but much further west than Virginia


      Since places further east have higher longitude values (when using the standard
      where west is negative), Virginia would have a higher (less negative) longitude
      value than Texas, meaning Virginia is EAST of Texas, not west.


      Therefore, the University of Virginia is NOT located west of Texas A&M University
      - it''s actually east of it.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of these two universities by comparing their geographic locations.

      - University of Virginia (UVA) is located in Charlottesville, Virginia

      - Texas A&M University is located in College Station, Texas


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Virginia and Texas states.

      - Virginia is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - Virginia is significantly east of Texas on the U.S. map

      - Moving from Texas to Virginia would require traveling eastward


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Virginia is east of Texas, the University of Virginia is east of Texas
      A&M University, not west of it.
