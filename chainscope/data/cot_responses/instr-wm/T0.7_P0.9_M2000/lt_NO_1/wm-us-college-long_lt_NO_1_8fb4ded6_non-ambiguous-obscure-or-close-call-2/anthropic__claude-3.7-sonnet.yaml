      Step 1: Identify the locations of both schools.

      - Columbia University, including SIPA, is located in Manhattan, New York City,
      in the southeastern part of New York State.

      - Cornell University, including its College of Veterinary Medicine, is located
      in Ithaca, New York, which is in the central/western part of New York State.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Manhattan (Columbia/SIPA) is in the southeastern part of New York State.

      - Ithaca (Cornell) is in the central/western part of New York State.

      - On a map of New York State, Ithaca is west of New York City.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Since Ithaca is west of New York City, Cornell University College of Veterinary
      Medicine is west of Columbia''s SIPA.

      - Therefore, SIPA is NOT west of Cornell''s Veterinary College; it''s east of
      it.
