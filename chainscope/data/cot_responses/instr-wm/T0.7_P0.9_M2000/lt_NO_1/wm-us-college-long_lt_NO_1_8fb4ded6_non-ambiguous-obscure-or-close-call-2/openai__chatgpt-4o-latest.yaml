      \ the locations of the universities:**\n   - The University of Virginia (UVA)\
      \ is located in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n   - Texas A&M University is located\
      \ in College Station, Texas.\n\n2. **Understand US geography:**\n   - Virginia\

      \ in the south-central region of the United States.\n\n3. **Compare the longitudes:**\n\
      \   - Charlottesville, VA, is approximately at longitude 78\xB0W.\n   - College\
      \ Station, TX, is approximately at longitude 96\xB0W.\n\n4. **Interpret the\
      \ longitudes:**\n   - A smaller (less negative) longitude means the location\
