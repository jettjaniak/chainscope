    045d23da-cea5-4eba-949e-685d8df297d2: 'To answer this question,
      let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Locate the College of the University of Chicago, IL**: The University of
      Chicago is located in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago is in the Midwestern United
      States.


      2. **Locate the California Institute of Technology, CA**: The California Institute
      of Technology (Caltech) is located in Pasadena, California. California is on
      the West Coast of the United States.


      3. **Compare their geographic positions**: Chicago, Illinois, is east of Pasadena,
      California. The United States extends from east to west, with the West Coast
      being the westernmost part of the country.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Chicago, Illinois, is east of Pasadena, California,
      the College of the University of Chicago is **not** west of the California Institute
      of Technology.

      let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Locate Duke University''s Graduate School**: Duke University is located
      in Durham, North Carolina, which is in the southeastern United States.


      2. **Locate the University of Texas at Austin College of Liberal Arts**: The
      University of Texas at Austin is located in Austin, Texas, which is in the southern
      central United States.


      3. **Compare the geographic positions**: North Carolina (where Duke is located)
      is east of Texas (where UT Austin is located). Therefore, Duke University''s
      Graduate School is east of the University of Texas at Austin College of Liberal
      Arts.


      4. **Answer the question**: Since Duke University is east of UT Austin, it is
      **not** west of UT Austin.
