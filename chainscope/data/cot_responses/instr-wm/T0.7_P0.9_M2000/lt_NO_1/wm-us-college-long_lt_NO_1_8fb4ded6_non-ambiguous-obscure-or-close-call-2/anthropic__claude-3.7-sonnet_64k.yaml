      University of Chicago, IL is located west of the California Institute of Technology
      (Caltech), CA, I need to know the geographic locations of both institutions.


      1. The University of Chicago is located in Chicago, Illinois.

      2. The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) is located in Pasadena,
      California.


      Now I need to determine which one is further west. In the United States, when
      comparing the east-west positioning:

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - California is on the West Coast of the United States


      Geographically, California is further west than Illinois. In fact, California
      is one of the westernmost states in the continental United States, while Illinois
      is more in the middle-eastern part of the country.


      Therefore, the College of the University of Chicago (in Illinois) is NOT located
      west of the California Institute of Technology (in California). It is actually
      east of Caltech.


      So the answer is NO.</think>I need to determine the geographic locations of
      both institutions and compare their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - The University of Chicago is located in Chicago, Illinois.

      - California Institute of Technology (Caltech) is located in Pasadena, California.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - California is on the West Coast of the United States.

      - When looking at a map of the US, California is significantly further west
      than Illinois.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      - Since California is west of Illinois, the University of Chicago (in Illinois)
      must be east of Caltech (in California).

      - Therefore, the University of Chicago is NOT west of Caltech.


      NO'

      Florida State University is located in Tallahassee, Florida, which is in the
      northern part of Florida.

      The University of Phoenix is headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, which is centrally
      located in Arizona.


      Since Arizona is west of Florida on a map of the United States, the University
      of Phoenix in Arizona would be west of Florida State University in Florida.


      Therefore, Florida State University is NOT west of the University of Phoenix.
      Instead, it''s east of the University of Phoenix.


      The answer is NO.</think># Is Florida State University, FL located west of University
      of Phoenix, AZ?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Locate the states

      - Florida (FL) is on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Arizona (AZ) is in the southwestern United States


      ## Step 2: Consider their relative positions

      - On a US map, Florida is on the far eastern side of the country

      - Arizona is on the western side of the country

      - Moving from east to west across the US, you would encounter Florida before
      Arizona


      ## Step 3: Determine the specific locations

      - Florida State University is in Tallahassee, Florida

      - University of Phoenix is headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona

      - All of Florida, including Tallahassee, is east of all of Arizona


      Since Florida is east of Arizona, Florida State University must be east of (not
      west of) the University of Phoenix.

      To determine if FSU is west of University of Phoenix, I need to compare their
      locations on a map, specifically looking at their longitudes.


      Let me think about the general geographical positions:

      - Florida is on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Arizona is in the southwestern part of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      \ in New York City, specifically in Manhattan (in the Morningside Heights neighborhood).\n\
      \n2. Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine is part of Cornell University,\

      \ State, near the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIthaca is located in the central/western\
      \ part of New York State, in the Finger Lakes region.\n\nWhen comparing east-west\
      \ positions in the United States, lower longitude numbers indicate more western\
      \ locations. In this case:\n- New York City (Manhattan) is approximately at\
      \ longitude 74\xB0 W\n- Ithaca is approximately at longitude 76.5\xB0 W\n\n\
      Since 76.5 is greater than 74, Ithaca is further west than New York City.\n\n\
      Therefore, the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University\
      \ (in NYC) is NOT located west of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine\
      \ (in Ithaca). In fact, it's the opposite - the Cornell University College of\
      \ Veterinary Medicine is west of the School of International and Public Affairs.\n\
      \nI need to double-check this to make sure I haven't made an error in my reasoning\
      \ about east-west directions. In the United States:\n- East Coast is at approximately\
      \ 70-80\xB0 W longitude\n- West Coast is at approximately 120-125\xB0 W longitude\n\
      \nWhen moving from east to west in the US, longitude numbers increase from the\
      \ prime meridian (0\xB0) until 180\xB0 (the International Date Line). Wait,\
      \ that's not right. When moving east to west, longitude numbers increase from\
      \ 0\xB0 to 180\xB0, but in the Western Hemisphere (where the US is located),\
      \ longitude is expressed as degrees West, so the numbers actually decrease as\
      \ you move west to east.\n\nLet me verify this again:\n- Eastern US (e.g., Maine)\
      \ is around 67-70\xB0 W\n- Western US (e.g., Washington) is around 120-125\xB0\
      \ W\n\nSo when comparing east-west positions in the US, higher longitude numbers\
      \ (e.g., 76.5\xB0 W) indicate more eastern locations than lower numbers (e.g.,\
      \ 120\xB0 W).\n\nLet me correct my previous reasoning:\n- New York City (Manhattan)\
      \ is approximately at longitude 74\xB0 W\n- Ithaca is approximately at longitude\
      \ 76.5\xB0 W\n\nSince 76.5\xB0 W is a higher number than 74\xB0 W when expressed\
      \ as \"degrees West,\" Ithaca is actually further EAST than New York City.\n\
      \nWait, that's still not correct. Let me be more precise about how longitude\
      \ works:\n\nLongitude is measured in degrees east or west of the prime meridian\
      \ (0\xB0). In the Western Hemisphere (where the US is located):\n- Values are\
      \ expressed as \"degrees West\" or with negative numbers\n- The East Coast is\
      \ approximately 65-80\xB0 W\n- The West Coast is approximately 120-125\xB0 W\n\
      \nSo the HIGHER the \"degrees West\" number, the FURTHER WEST a location is.\n\
      \nLet me check the specific coordinates:\n- Columbia University (NYC): approximately\
      \ 73.96\xB0 W\n- Cornell University (Ithaca): approximately 76.48\xB0 W\n\n\
      Since 76.48 > 73.96, Cornell is FURTHER WEST than Columbia.\n\nTherefore, the\
      \ School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University is NOT located\
      \ west of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. It is located EAST\
      \ of Cornell.\n\nActually, wait, let me make sure I have the directions correct.\
      \ In the Western Hemisphere:\n- Longitude increases from 0\xB0 at the prime\
      \ meridian as you go west\n- Longitude is typically expressed as degrees West\
      \ (\xB0W)\n- Higher numbers of degrees West indicate locations further west\n\
      \nFor example:\n- New York City: ~74\xB0W\n- Chicago: ~87\xB0W\n- Denver: ~105\xB0\
      W\n- Los Angeles: ~118\xB0W\n\nSo higher degrees West means further west in\
      \ North America.\n\nLet's confirm the locations again:\n- Columbia University\
      \ (NYC): approximately 73.96\xB0 W\n- Cornell University (Ithaca): approximately\
      \ 76.48\xB0 W\n\nSince 76.48 > 73.96, Cornell is FURTHER WEST than Columbia.\n\
      \nTherefore, the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University\
      \ is NOT located west of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\
      \nThe answer is NO.\n\nActually, I'm still confused about the directions. Let\
      \ me try once more, step by step:\n\nLongitude is measured in degrees east or\
      \ west of the prime meridian (0\xB0). \n- Locations in the Western Hemisphere\
      \ have west longitude (\xB0W)\n- Moving west from the prime meridian, longitude\
      \ values increase from 0\xB0 to 180\xB0\n- In the Western Hemisphere, as you\
      \ move west, the longitude value (degrees West) increases\n\nExamples in the\

      W\n- Chicago: ~87\xB0W\n- Denver: ~105\xB0W\n- Los Angeles: ~118\xB0W\n\nSo\
      \ higher degrees West (\xB0W) means further west in North America.\n\nLet's\
      \ check the locations one more time:\n- Columbia University (NYC): approximately\
      \ 73.96\xB0 W\n- Cornell University (Ithaca): approximately 76.48\xB0 W\n\n\
      Since 76.48 > 73.96, Cornell is FURTHER WEST than Columbia.\n\nTherefore, the\
      \ School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University is NOT located\
      \ west of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nThe answer is\
      \ NO.\n\nWait, I think I've been making this confusing. Let me simplify. For\
      \ places in the US:\n\n- East Coast cities have lower west longitude numbers\
      \ (Boston ~71\xB0W, NYC ~74\xB0W)\n- West Coast cities have higher west longitude\

      Cornell University''s main campus is located in Ithaca, NY. The Cornell University
      College of Veterinary Medicine is part of Cornell University and is located
      on the main campus in Ithaca.


      Now, I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two locations.


      New York City (Manhattan) is located in southeastern New York state, close to
      the Atlantic Ocean.


      Ithaca, NY is located in the Finger Lakes region in central New York state.


      On a map, Manhattan (where Columbia University and SIPA are located) is to the

      Now, I need to determine which is further west:


      New York City (where Columbia University/SIPA is located) is in southeastern
      New York State.

      Ithaca (where Cornell University/College of Veterinary Medicine is located)

      Wait, I should double-check this. Let me think about the geography of New York
      State:

      - New York City is in the southeastern corner of New York State.

      - Ithaca is upstate, in the central/western part of the state.


      Looking at a mental map of New York State:

      - NYC is close to the Atlantic Ocean on the east

      - Ithaca is more inland and west


      Actually, I need to be careful here. While Cornell''s main campus is in Ithaca,
      I should verify that the College of Veterinary Medicine is also in Ithaca, and
      not at some satellite campus. Similarly, I should verify that the School of
      International and Public Affairs is at Columbia''s main campus in Manhattan.


      The Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine is indeed located on Cornell''s
      main campus in Ithaca, NY.


      The School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) is located on Columbia
      University''s main campus in Manhattan, New York City.


      So now I can compare:

      - SIPA at Columbia is in Manhattan (NYC), which is in southeastern New York
      State

      - Cornell''s College of Veterinary Medicine is in Ithaca, which is in central/western
      New York State


      If we look at a west-to-east orientation, Ithaca is to the west of New York

      New York State.

      - Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine is located on Cornell''s
      main campus in Ithaca, NY, which is in the central/western part of New York
      State in the Finger Lakes region.


      ## Step 2: Compare east-west positions

      - New York City (where Columbia University is) is in the southeastern portion
      of New York State, close to the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Ithaca (where Cornell University is) is significantly west of NYC, more inland
      in the state.


      ## Step 3: Determine relative position

      - Cornell''s College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca is west of Columbia''s
      SIPA in Manhattan.

      - Columbia''s SIPA is east of Cornell''s College of Veterinary Medicine.


      Therefore, the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University
      is NOT located west of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.

      whether the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University
      in New York is located west of the Cornell University College of Veterinary
      Medicine in New York.


      To answer this question, I need to know the locations of both institutions:


      1. School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University - This is
      located in New York City, specifically in Manhattan.


      2. Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine - This is located in Ithaca,
      New York, which is in the central part of New York State.


      Now I need to determine which one is more west (or more east).


      New York City (where Columbia University is located) is in the southeastern
      part of New York State, on the Atlantic coast.


      Ithaca (where Cornell University is located) is in the central part of New York
      State, in the Finger Lakes region.


      Geographically, Ithaca is west of New York City. If you look at a map of New
      York State, New York City is closer to the eastern edge of the state, while
      Ithaca is more inland and westward.


      Therefore, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine (in Ithaca) is
      west of the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University
      (in NYC).


      So, is the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University,
      NY located west of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, NY?


      No, it''s the opposite. The School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia
      University is east of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.</think>#
      Step-by-Step Reasoning


      First, I need to identify the locations of both institutions:


      1. The School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University is
      located in New York City, specifically in Manhattan, which is in the southeastern
      part of New York State.


      2. Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine is located in Ithaca, NY,
      which is in the central/western part of New York State in the Finger Lakes region.


      Looking at the geography of New York State:

      - New York City (Columbia) is near the Atlantic coast on the eastern side of
      the state

      - Ithaca (Cornell) is significantly inland and to the west of NYC


      On a map, Ithaca is approximately 200 miles northwest of New York City. Therefore,
      Cornell''s College of Veterinary Medicine is west of Columbia''s School of International
      and Public Affairs, not the other way around.

      \ University): approximately 74\xB0W longitude\n- Ithaca, NY (Cornell University):\
      \ approximately 76.5\xB0W longitude\n\nSince longitude increases as you go west,\
      \ the higher number (76.5\xB0W) is further west than the lower number (74\xB0\
      W). This confirms that Cornell is west of Columbia, not the other way around.\n\

      MIT is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is in the eastern part of
      Massachusetts, near Boston.


      Step 2: Determine the location of Syracuse University.

      Syracuse University is located in Syracuse, New York, which is in central New
      York state.


      Step 3: Consider the general geography of the northeastern United States.

      Massachusetts is east of New York state. Specifically, Massachusetts forms part
      of the eastern seaboard of the US, while New York extends from the eastern seaboard
      westward toward the Great Lakes.


      Step 4: Compare the specific locations.

      Cambridge (where MIT is located) is in eastern Massachusetts, near the Atlantic
      coast.

      Syracuse is in central New York state, which is west of Massachusetts.

      First, let''s identify the locations:

      1. Boston University is located in Boston, Massachusetts, which is on the East
      Coast of the United States.

      2. University of California, San Francisco is located in San Francisco, California,
      which is on the West Coast of the United States.


      In the United States, the East Coast is generally to the east (right side on
      a typical map) and the West Coast is to the west (left side on a typical map).
      This means that:

      - California is located to the west of Massachusetts

      - San Francisco, CA is located to the west of Boston, MA

      - Therefore, University of California, San Francisco is located to the west
      of Boston University


      Now, to answer the specific question: "Is Boston University, MA located west
      of University of California, San Francisco, CA?"


      Since Boston University is on the East Coast and University of California, San
      Francisco is on the West Coast, Boston University is located EAST (not west)
      of University of California, San Francisco.


      So the answer is NO, Boston University is not located west of University of

      Coast of the United States.


      2) University of California, San Francisco is located in San Francisco, California,
      which is on the West Coast of the United States.


      3) In the continental United States, the West Coast (California) is west of

      - The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) is located in San Francisco,

      - The west coast is on the western side of the country, facing the Pacific Ocean.


      Generally, locations on the west coast (like California) are west of locations

      - University of California, San Francisco is in San Francisco, California, which
      is on the West Coast of the United States


      In the United States, the continental geography runs such that:

      - The East Coast (including Massachusetts) is on the eastern side of the country

      - The West Coast (including California) is on the western side of the country


      When comparing east-west positions in the continental US, California is always

    5d95e043-4855-46e8-8054-4cc1bfde993c: '<think>This question is asking about the
      relative geographical locations of two US universities: Harvard Summer School
      in Massachusetts and Arizona State University in Arizona. Specifically, it''s
      asking whether Harvard Summer School is located west of Arizona State University.


      Let me think about the locations of these universities:


      1. Harvard Summer School is in Massachusetts (MA), which is on the East Coast
      of the United States.

      2. Arizona State University is in Arizona (AZ), which is in the southwestern
      United States.


      Now, I need to determine which one is further west.


      The United States generally extends from east to west, with the East Coast (including
      Massachusetts) being on the eastern edge and states like California, Oregon,
      and Washington forming the western edge. The southwestern states, including
      Arizona, are closer to the western side of the country than the East Coast states.


      So, Massachusetts is on the East Coast, and Arizona is in the Southwest. In
      terms of geography, Massachusetts is east of Arizona, not west of it. This means
      that Harvard Summer School (in Massachusetts) is east of Arizona State University
      (in Arizona), not west of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Harvard Summer School, MA is not located west of
      Arizona State University, AZ. It is located east of Arizona State University.</think>#
      Is Harvard Summer School, MA located west of Arizona State University, AZ?


      To answer this question, I need to consider the geographic locations of both

      1. Harvard Summer School is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts (MA), which
      is on the East Coast of the United States.


      2. Arizona State University is located in Tempe, Arizona (AZ), which is in the
      southwestern United States.


      3. Geographically, the United States extends from the Atlantic Ocean (east)
      to the Pacific Ocean (west). Massachusetts is on the eastern seaboard, while
      Arizona is much farther west.


      4. On a map of the United States, Massachusetts is clearly east of Arizona.


      Therefore, Harvard Summer School is located EAST of Arizona State University,
      not west of it.

      School is located west of Arizona State University.


      To answer this, I need to know the relative locations of Massachusetts and Arizona
      in the United States.


      Massachusetts is located in the northeastern part of the United States, on the
      East Coast.

      Arizona is located in the southwestern part of the United States.


      When we say "west" in geography, we''re typically referring to longitude, where
      places further west have a greater longitude (going westward from the Prime
      Meridian until we reach the International Date Line).


      In the United States, states on the East Coast (like Massachusetts) are east
      of states in the Southwest (like Arizona). This means that Massachusetts is
      east of Arizona, not west.


      Therefore, Harvard Summer School, which is in Massachusetts, is located east
      of Arizona State University, which is in Arizona. It is not located west of
      Arizona State University.

      2) Arizona State University is located in Tempe, Arizona, which is in the southwestern

      Coast.

      2. Illinois (IL) is located in the midwestern United States, bordering Lake

      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Georgia is generally located to the east of Illinois.

      - This means that University of Georgia is likely east of Northwestern University,
      not west.


      To be more precise:

      - The University of Georgia is located in Athens, Georgia, which is in the northeastern
      part of Georgia.

      - Northwestern University is located in Evanston, Illinois, which is in the

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Georgia is located in Athens, Georgia (GA)

      - Northwestern University is located in Evanston, Illinois (IL)


      Step 2: Consider the general east-west positioning of these states.

      - Georgia is a southeastern state, bordering the Atlantic Ocean

      - Illinois is a midwestern state, much further inland


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on a U.S. map.

      - Georgia is positioned significantly east of Illinois

      - When moving from Illinois to Georgia, you would travel eastward, not westward


      Step 4: Make the final determination based on longitude.

      - Georgia''s longitude is farther east (smaller negative number) than Illinois

      - Therefore, University of Georgia is east of Northwestern University, not west

      The United States generally has states arranged from west to east as you move
      from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean. Let me think about where Virginia
      and Texas are located relative to each other:


      - Virginia is a state on the East Coast of the United States, bordering the
      Atlantic Ocean.

      - Texas is in the southern part of the United States, bordering the Gulf of
      Mexico, and is much further west than Virginia.


      In terms of longitude (which measures east-west position), Texas is definitely
      west of Virginia. This means that institutions in Texas would generally be west
      of institutions in Virginia.


      Therefore, Texas A&M University, which is in Texas, would be west of the University
      of Virginia, which is in Virginia.


      To answer the specific question: "Is University of Virginia, VA located west

      - Texas A&M University is in College Station, Texas

      - Virginia is on the East Coast

    f31ebdad-01ff-4ffd-ba73-5b911bf512a7: '<think>To determine whether the University
      of Virginia (UVA) in Virginia is located west of Texas A&M University in Texas,
      I need to compare their geographical locations.


      First, let''s think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Virginia is a state on the East Coast of the United States

      - Texas is located in the southern United States, significantly west of Virginia


      Given this general knowledge, I can already infer that Virginia is east of Texas,
      not west of it.


      To be more specific:

      - The University of Virginia is in Charlottesville, Virginia

      - Texas A&M University is in College Station, Texas


      Since Virginia is east of Texas, UVA would be east of Texas A&M, not west of
      it.


      So to answer the question "Is University of Virginia, VA located west of Texas
      A&M University, TX?" - the answer is clearly NO.</think>I need to determine
      the relative locations of these two universities by considering their state
      locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Virginia (UVA) is in Charlottesville, Virginia

      - Texas A&M University is in College Station, Texas


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Virginia and Texas within the United
      States.

      - Virginia is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Texas is located in the southern central part of the United States, significantly
      west of Virginia


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - Virginia is approximately 1,200-1,500 miles east of Texas

      - Therefore, UVA would be east of Texas A&M, not west of it


      NO, the University of Virginia is not located west of Texas A&M University.
      It is located east of it.'
