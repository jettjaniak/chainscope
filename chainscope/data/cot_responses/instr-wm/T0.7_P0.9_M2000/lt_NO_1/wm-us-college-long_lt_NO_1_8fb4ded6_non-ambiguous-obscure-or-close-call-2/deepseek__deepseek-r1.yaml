    1140b7f5-2ea8-468a-ae0c-9b78ac9607f9: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure this out.\
      \ The question is asking if the College of the University of Chicago in Illinois\
      \ is located west of the California Institute of Technology in California. Hmm,\
      \ at first glance, that seems a bit counterintuitive because California is on\
      \ the west coast, and Chicago is in the Midwest. But maybe there's some trick\
      \ here I'm missing. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm\
      \ the locations of both institutions. The University of Chicago is in Chicago,\
      \ IL. Chicago is a major city in Illinois, which is in the central part of the\
      \ United States. The California Institute of Technology, commonly known as Caltech,\
      \ is located in Pasadena, California. California is on the west coast, so Caltech\
      \ is definitely in the western part of the US.\n\nNow, the question is about\
      \ which one is farther west. To determine this, I need to compare the longitudes\
      \ of Chicago and Pasadena. Longitude measures how far east or west a location\
      \ is. The Prime Meridian is 0 degrees, and locations to the west have negative\
      \ longitudes in the Western Hemisphere. The more negative the longitude, the\
      \ farther west it is. Wait, no, actually in the US, which is west of the Prime\
      \ Meridian, the longitude values are negative. So a smaller (more negative)\
      \ longitude value would be further west. Wait, that might be confusing. Let\
      \ me think again: longitude increases as you go east from the Prime Meridian.\
      \ So, for example, the longitude of Chicago is around 87.6 degrees West (which\
      \ would be -87.6), and Pasadena is around 118.1 degrees West (-118.1). Wait,\
      \ so if a place is further west, its longitude is a larger negative number.\
      \ So, -118 is more west than -87.6. Therefore, Caltech in Pasadena is further\
      \ west than the University of Chicago. So the answer is NO, the University of\
      \ Chicago is not west of Caltech. Caltech is further west.\n\nBut wait, just\
      \ to double-check, let me confirm the approximate longitudes. Quick search in\
      \ my mind: Chicago is around 41.8\xB0 N latitude, 87.6\xB0 W longitude. Pasadena,\
      \ CA is approximately 34.1\xB0 N latitude, 118.1\xB0 W longitude. So comparing\
      \ the longitudes: 87.6\xB0 W vs. 118.1\xB0 W. Since the longitude of Caltech\
      \ is higher in the west direction (118.1 is west of 87.6), that means Caltech\
      \ is further west. Therefore, Chicago is east of Caltech. So the answer is NO.\n\
      </think>NO  \nThe University of Chicago, IL, is located at approximately **87.6\xB0\
      \ W** longitude, while the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena,\
      \ CA, is at **118.1\xB0 W** longitude. Since lower (more westerly) longitude\
      \ values extend further west, Caltech is west of Chicago. Thus, the University\
      \ of Chicago is not west of Caltech."

      \ So, we need to determine if the College of the University of Chicago in Illinois\

      \ okay. Let's start by recalling where these two institutions are.\n\nFirst,\
      \ the University of Chicago is in Chicago, IL. Chicago is a major city in the\
      \ Midwest, known for being on Lake Michigan. I'm pretty sure Chicago is in the\
      \ northern part of Illinois. On the other hand, Caltech is in Pasadena, California,\
      \ which is near Los Angeles. Southern California, right? \n\nNow, the question\
      \ is about their longitude because west and east are determined by longitude.\
      \ Places with a higher longitude (more to the west) have higher west coordinates,\
      \ but wait, longitude actually increases as you go east from the prime meridian.\
      \ Wait, no, the prime meridian is 0\xB0, and longitude west of it is west longitude\
      \ (like the Americas) and east is east longitude (like Europe, Asia). But in\
      \ the US, all longitudes are west, so they're measured as degrees west of the\
      \ prime meridian. So higher longitude west would mean further west. Wait, no,\
      \ actually, in terms of decimal degrees, west longitudes are negative when using\
      \ the common format where east is positive. Wait, maybe I should just look up\
      \ the approximate longitudes for both cities.\n\nFrom what I remember, Chicago\
      \ is around 41.8781\xB0 N latitude and 87.6298\xB0 W longitude. Caltech in Pasadena\
      \ is approximately 34.1478\xB0 N, 118.1445\xB0 W. So, comparing their longitudes:\
      \ Chicago is at about 87.6\xB0 W, and Pasadena is at 118.1\xB0 W. Wait, longitude\
      \ is measured from 0\xB0 at the prime meridian going west to 180\xB0. So, the\
      \ higher the longitude degree (in the west), the further west the location is.\
      \ So 118\xB0W is further west than 87\xB0W. Therefore, Pasadena (Caltech) is\
      \ west of Chicago. That would mean Chicago is east of Caltech, so the answer\
      \ would be NO, the College of the University of Chicago is not west of Caltech.\
      \ Instead, it's east.\n\nWait, but wait, let me confirm the longitudes again\
      \ to be safe. Maybe I mixed up the numbers. Chicago's longitude is around 87.6\xB0\
      \ West, and Pasadena is around 118.1\xB0 West. Since longitude increases as\
      \ you go west, 118 is more west than 87. So Caltech is further west, meaning\
      \ Chicago is east of it. Therefore, the answer is NO.\n</think>The University\

      \ California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, CA, is at about\
      \ 118.1\xB0 W. Since longitude increases westward, a higher numerical value\
      \ (118.1\xB0 W) indicates a more westerly location. Therefore, Caltech is west\
      \ of the University of Chicago. \n\n**Answer: NO**"

      \nNow, I know that the United States is generally divided into east and west\
      \ with the Mississippi River sometimes considered a rough dividing line, but\
      \ more accurately, longitude plays a role here. So I should check the longitude\

      \ their longitudinal positions. The one further west would have a higher longitude\
      \ value if we're using the standard where west longitudes are negative, but\
      \ I might need to check the actual coordinates. Wait, no\u2014actually, in the\
      \ US, all longitudes are west of the Prime Meridian, so they're negative values.\
      \ The further west you go, the more negative the longitude becomes. So, for\
      \ example, California is further west than Illinois, so its longitude would\
      \ be more negative (i.e., a lower numerical value if you ignore the negative\
      \ sign, but technically a smaller number because -118 is less than -87). Wait,\
      \ no\u2014I think longitude coordinates for Chicago would be around -87.6 degrees,\
      \ and for Pasadena, around -118 degrees. Since -118 is more to the west than\
      \ -87.6, that means Caltech is west of the University of Chicago. Therefore,\
      \ the University of Chicago would be east of Caltech. So the answer should be\
      \ NO, the College of the University of Chicago is not west of Caltech. It's\

      \ of Caltech. So the original question is asking if Chicago's college is west\
      \ of Caltech\u2014so the answer is NO. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should visualize\
      \ a map. The US map has California on the West Coast, and Illinois is in the\
      \ Midwest. So moving from east to west, you go from the East Coast, then the\
      \ Midwest (including Illinois), then the Mountain states, then the West Coast\

      \ Since lower longitudes (more negative) indicate positions further west, Caltech\

    d3735877-ae4d-43ed-9ac8-df4eac9af45a: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure out if\
      \ the College of the University of Chicago in Illinois is west of the California\
      \ Institute of Technology in California. Hmm, first, I need to know where these\
      \ two institutions are located geographically.\n\nThe University of Chicago\
      \ is in Chicago, Illinois. I know Chicago is in the Midwest, on the shore of\
      \ Lake Michigan. California Institute of Technology, or Caltech, is in Pasadena,\
      \ California. Pasadena is near Los Angeles, so that's on the West Coast of the\
      \ US. \n\nNow, the question is about their longitude. The one further west would\
      \ have a higher longitude if we're using the standard coordinate system where\
      \ west longitudes are negative numbers, but actually, wait, in the US, all longitudes\
      \ are west of the Prime Meridian, so they're all negative. So the more negative\
      \ the longitude, the further west it is. Wait, no, because when you go west\
      \ from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0), the longitude becomes negative, but moving\
      \ west beyond 0\xB0 makes the numbers increase in the negative direction. Wait,\
      \ I might be getting confused here. Let me clarify: Longitude is measured from\
      \ 0\xB0 at the Prime Meridian (Greenwich) going east to 180\xB0 East and west\
      \ to 180\xB0 West, but in terms of coordinates, locations in the Americas have\
      \ west longitudes, which are typically represented as negative numbers (e.g.,\
      \ 87\xB0W is -87\xB0, 118\xB0W is -118\xB0). So, the more negative the longitude\
      \ (i.e., the smaller the number when considering negative values), the further\
      \ east it is. Conversely, a less negative number (closer to zero) would be further\
      \ west. Wait, no. Wait, if you have -80\xB0 longitude (80\xB0W) and -120\xB0\
      \ longitude (120\xB0W), which is further west? Let's think: 120\xB0W is further\
      \ west than 80\xB0W because 120 is a larger number when measured west from the\
      \ Prime Meridian. But in terms of the numeric value as negative, -120 is less\
      \ than -80. So, when comparing longitude coordinates, a more negative value\
      \ (like -120) is actually further west than a less negative value (like -80).\
      \ So for example, Los Angeles is around -118.4\xB0 longitude, and Chicago is\
      \ around -87.6\xB0 longitude. Since -118.4 is less than -87.6 (because it's\
      \ more negative), Los Angeles (Caltech) is further west than Chicago. Therefore,\
      \ Chicago's longitude is -87.6, which is not as far west as Pasadena's -118.4.\
      \ So the University of Chicago is east of Caltech. Therefore, the answer would\
      \ be NO, the College of the University of Chicago is not west of Caltech.\n\
      </think>The University of Chicago is located in Illinois at approximately 87.6\xB0\
      W longitude, while Caltech in Pasadena, California, is at approximately 118.4\xB0\
      W longitude. Since lower (more negative) longitude values indicate positions\
      \ further west, Caltech (118.4\xB0W) is west of the University of Chicago (87.6\xB0\
      W). Therefore, the University of Chicago is east of Caltech.\n\nAnswer: NO"

      \ whether Florida State University in Florida is located west of the University\
      \ of Phoenix in Arizona. Hmm, that's interesting. I need to figure out the geographic\
      \ locations of both universities and compare their longitudes. \n\nFirst, I\
      \ should recall where each university is located. Florida State University (FSU)\
      \ is in Florida, right? The main campus is in Tallahassee, I think. And the\
      \ University of Phoenix is a for-profit online university, but they have a physical\
      \ campus in Arizona. Wait, but where exactly? main administrative main administrative\
      \ main administrative main administrative main administrative main administrative\
      \ location is there. \n\nNow, I need to determine the longitude of Tallahassee,\
      \ FL, and Phoenix, AZ. Since the question is about being west, longitude is\
      \ the key. The further west a location is, the higher its longitude value (in\
      \ the Western Hemisphere, longitude is measured as west, so higher negative\
      \ numbers if we're using the convention where east is positive). Wait, no, actually,\
      \ longitude in the Americas is measured in degrees west of the Prime Meridian,\
      \ so they would be negative values if using the -180 to +180 system. For example,\
      \ locations in the US have negative longitudes. So Phoenix, AZ, is in the Mountain\
      \ Time Zone, which is west of the Eastern Time Zone where Florida is. So Phoenix\
      \ should be further west than Tallahassee.\n\nBut let me confirm. Let me think:\
      \ Florida is on the East Coast of the US, so Tallahassee is in the panhandle\
      \ of Florida, which is the northwestern part of the state. But Arizona is in\
      \ the Southwest. So Phoenix is definitely west of Tallahassee. Therefore, the\
      \ University of Phoenix in Arizona would be west of Florida State University\
      \ in Florida. Wait, but the question is phrased as \"Is FSU located west of\
      \ University of Phoenix?\" So if Phoenix is west of Tallahassee, then FSU is\
      \ east of Phoenix. Therefore, the answer would be NO.\n\nBut maybe I should\
      \ check the exact longitudes. Let me try to recall approximate longitudes. Tallahassee,\
      \ FL: I know that the state of Florida extends from around 80 degrees west (like\
      \ Miami) to about 87 degrees west in the panhandle. Tallahassee is in the panhandle,\
      \ so maybe around 84 degrees west longitude? Phoenix, AZ, is in the southwestern\
      \ part of the US. Arizona is in the Mountain Time Zone, which is UTC-7, while\
      \ Florida is in Eastern Time (UTC-5). The central meridian for Mountain Time\
      \ is 105 degrees west, but Phoenix is actually a bit west of that. Wait, no,\
      \ Arizona mostly doesn't observe daylight saving time, but their standard time\
      \ is UTC-7. The approximate longitude for Phoenix is around 112 degrees west.\
      \ Wait, that seems too far. Let me think: The US spans from about 67 degrees\
      \ west (east coast) to 125 degrees west (west coast). For example, Los Angeles\
      \ is around 118 degrees west. Phoenix is in Arizona, which is west of Texas.\
      \ Texas's westernmost point is around 106 degrees west. Arizona is next, so\
      \ Phoenix is around 112 degrees west? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think:\
      \ The approximate longitude of Phoenix, AZ is 112\xB0W? Or maybe 111\xB0W? Let\
      \ me check mentally. For example, Denver is around 105\xB0W. Phoenix is southwest\
      \ of Denver, so maybe around 112\xB0W. Whereas Tallahassee, FL is around 84\xB0\
      W. So 84\xB0W vs 112\xB0W. Since longitude increases as you go west in the Western\
      \ Hemisphere (but with negative values when using the decimal system where east\
      \ is positive), but when considering absolute west direction, the higher the\
      \ numerical value (in degrees west), the further west. So Phoenix at 112\xB0\
      W is further west than Tallahassee at 84\xB0W. Therefore, FSU (in Tallahassee)\
      \ is east of University of Phoenix (Phoenix, AZ). Therefore, the answer is NO,\
      \ FSU is not west of University of Phoenix.\n</think>To determine if Florida\

      \ State University is in Florida, and the University of Phoenix is in Arizona.\
      \ But where exactly are their campuses? \n\nWait, FSU's main campus is in Tallahassee,\
      \ which is the capital of Florida. The University of Phoenix has multiple locations,\

      \ \n\nFlorida's longitude: The state of Florida spans from about 80\xB0W to\

      \ longitude (more negative, i.e., 112\xB0W is 112 degrees west of Greenwich,\
      \ which is -112 in decimal). Tallahassee at 84\xB0W (-84). Since -112 is smaller\

      \ position, a higher longitude value (more west) would mean a location is further\
      \ west.\n\nLet me look up the longitude coordinates. Tallahassee's coordinates\
      \ are approximately 84.28\xB0 W. Phoenix, AZ is around 112.07\xB0 W. Wait, longitude\
      \ is measured from the prime meridian, which is 0\xB0 at Greenwich. So the more\
      \ westward a place is, the higher the longitude value in the western hemisphere\
      \ (since it's west longitude). So Phoenix, being at 112.07\xB0 W, is much further\
      \ west than Tallahassee, which is at 84.28\xB0 W. \n\nBut wait, Phoenix's longitude\
      \ is 112\xB0 W, which is a larger number than 84\xB0 W. So that means Phoenix\
      \ is west of Tallahassee. Therefore, Florida State University (in Tallahassee)\
      \ is east of the University of Phoenix (in Phoenix). Therefore, the answer would\
      \ be NO, FSU is not west of University of Phoenix. \n\nLet me double-check to\
      \ make sure I didn't mix up east and west. Since the Earth is a sphere, but\
      \ when comparing two points in the same hemisphere (both west longitude), the\
      \ one with the higher longitude number is farther west. Because each degree\
      \ west increases as you go west from Greenwich. So Phoenix at 112\xB0 W is west\
      \ of Tallahassee at 84\xB0 W. So FSU is east of Phoenix. Therefore, the answer\
      \ is NO.\n</think>To determine if Florida State University (FSU) in Tallahassee,\
      \ FL, is west of the University of Phoenix in Phoenix, AZ, compare their longitudes:\
      \  \n- **FSU, Tallahassee**: ~84.28\xB0 W longitude  \n- **University of Phoenix,\
      \ Phoenix**: ~112.07\xB0 W longitude  \n\nSince **higher west longitude values\

      \ Florida State University in Florida is west of the University of Phoenix in\
      \ Arizona. Hmm, first I need to get the locations of both universities. \n\n\
      Florida State University is in Florida, right? The main campus is in Tallahassee,\
      \ I think. And the University of Phoenix is based in Arizona, probably Phoenix\
      \ since that's the city name. So I need to compare their longitudes because\
      \ east and west depend on longitude. The further west a place is, the higher\
      \ its longitude (in the Western Hemisphere), but wait, no\u2014longitude is\
      \ measured from the prime meridian. So places in the west have higher longitude\
      \ west values, but when considering the Americas, which are in the Western Hemisphere,\
      \ longitude is typically measured as west longitude. So, for example, Arizona\
      \ is in the Mountain Time Zone, which is west of Florida, which is in the Eastern\
      \ Time Zone. But time zones can sometimes be a rough guide.\n\nLet me look up\
      \ the actual coordinates. Florida State University in Tallahassee: I think Tallahassee\
      \ is in the northern part of Florida. Let me recall, Tallahassee's longitude\
      \ is around 84.28\xB0 W. And Phoenix, Arizona's longitude is about 112.07\xB0\
      \ W. Wait, longitude values west of the prime meridian are negative if we use\
      \ the convention where east is positive. But when we say degrees west, higher\
      \ numerical value (more west) would be a larger number. So comparing 84.28\xB0\
      \ W and 112.07\xB0 W, 112 is further west. Therefore, Phoenix, AZ, is at a more\
      \ westerly longitude than Tallahassee, FL. That means Florida State University\
      \ (Tallahassee) is east of the University of Phoenix (Phoenix). So the question\
      \ is asking if FSU is west of UoP. Since Phoenix is at 112\xB0 W and Tallahassee\

    b9b83286-fffe-46c7-8141-b6a95eee99cd: "<think>Alright, so I need to figure out\
      \ if Florida State University in Florida is located west of the University of\
      \ Phoenix in Arizona. Hmm, let's start by recalling the geographic locations\
      \ of both states. Florida is on the southeastern coast of the United States,\
      \ while Arizona is in the southwestern part. But I should be more precise.\n\
      \nFirst, I should get the exact locations of both universities. Florida State\
      \ University is in Tallahassee, Florida. The University of Phoenix has multiple\
      \ campuses, but their main administrative office or primary campus is in Phoenix,\
      \ Arizona. So I need the longitude coordinates of both cities to determine which\
      \ is farther west since longitude determines east-west positions.\n\nI remember\
      \ that longitude lines run from the North Pole to the South Pole, and higher\
      \ values going west from the prime meridian (which is 0 degrees, passing through\
      \ Greenwich, England). Wait, actually, in the Americas, the longitude is west\
      \ of the prime meridian, so the longitude values would be in the west, like\
      \ negative numbers if we're using the common format where east is positive and\
      \ west is negative. For example, in the US, locations have negative longitudes.\
      \ So the more negative the longitude, the farther west it is.\n\nSo Tallahassee,\
      \ FL: Let me try to recall or approximate. Florida is in the Eastern Time Zone,\
      \ which is generally around 75 to 85 degrees west longitude. Phoenix, Arizona\
      \ is in the Mountain Time Zone, which is around 105 to 115 degrees west. Wait,\
      \ Mountain Time is UTC-7, so their longitude is roughly around 105\xB0W to 115\xB0\
      W. For example, Phoenix is around 112\xB0W? Wait, no, Arizona is in the Mountain\
      \ Time Zone but doesn't observe daylight saving time except for the Navajo Nation.\
      \ But maybe I'm mixing up the exact longitude. Let me think: The approximate\
      \ longitude for Phoenix, AZ is around 112 degrees west? Wait, maybe I should\
      \ think of major cities. For example, Los Angeles is around 118\xB0W, Denver\
      \ around 105\xB0W. Phoenix is east of LA but west of, say, Denver? No, Phoenix\
      \ is south of Utah and Colorado. Let me check my mental map. Phoenix is in Arizona,\
      \ which is directly north of Mexico. The longitude of Phoenix is approximately\
      \ 112 degrees west. Wait, but maybe it's actually around 112\xB0W. Alternatively,\
      \ maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me verify another way. The state of Arizona is\
      \ between 109\xB0W and 114\xB0W in longitude. So Phoenix, the capital, is around\
      \ 112\xB0W. \n\nNow, Tallahassee, Florida: Florida's panhandle is the western\
      \ part of the state. Tallahassee is in the northern part of Florida, near the\
      \ Georgia border. Its longitude is around 84\xB0W. Let me confirm: Tallahassee\
      \ is actually at approximately 84.28\xB0W. Phoenix is at approximately 112.07\xB0\
      W. So longitude for Tallahassee is about 84\xB0W, Phoenix is 112\xB0W. \n\n\
      Wait, wait, but longitude west of the prime meridian increases as you go west.\
      \ So the more west you are, the higher the longitude value in the west (but\
      \ when expressed as a negative number, it becomes more negative). So if a location\
      \ is west of another, its longitude is more to the west (i.e., a larger negative\
      \ number). For example, if Phoenix is at -112.07 and Tallahassee is at -84.28,\
      \ then Phoenix is more west because -112.07 is less than -84.28 (since negative\
      \ numbers decrease as the number increases). Wait, actually, when dealing with\
      \ west longitudes, the numerical value increases as you go west, but with a\
      \ negative sign. So when comparing, a more westerly location would have a longitude\
      \ that is a larger negative number. So Phoenix's longitude is -112.07, Tallahassee's\
      \ is -84.28. Since -112.07 is more negative than -84.28, Phoenix is west of\
      \ Tallahassee. Therefore, Tallahassee is east of Phoenix. So Florida State University\
      \ (in Tallahassee) is east of University of Phoenix (in Phoenix). Therefore,\
      \ the answer would be NO, Florida State is not west of University of Phoenix.\
      \ \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't reverse it. Longitude: the prime meridian\
      \ is 0\xB0, and as you go west, the longitude becomes negative (in decimal notation).\
      \ So a place at 80\xB0W is -80, and 100\xB0W is -100. So -100 is west of -80\
      \ because 100\xB0W is further west than 80\xB0W. So Phoenix at -112 is west\
      \ of Tallahassee at -84. So Tallahassee is east of Phoenix. Therefore, Florida\
      \ State University is not west of University of Phoenix. Therefore, the answer\
      \ is NO.\n</think>To determine if Florida State University (FSU) in Tallahassee,\
      \ FL, is west of the University of Phoenix (UoP) in Phoenix, AZ, we compare\
      \ their longitudes. FSU is located at approximately **84.28\xB0W**, while UoP\
      \ is at **112.07\xB0W**. Since longitude increases westward (with more negative\
      \ values indicating farther west), Phoenix (-112.07\xB0W) is west of Tallahassee\
      \ (-84.28\xB0W). Thus, FSU is **east** of UoP.\n\n**ANSWER: NO**"
    ce9afd4e-c33e-43e4-947b-d914c5e6bb01: "<think>Okay, let's see. I need to figure\
      \ out whether Florida State University in Florida is located west of the University\
      \ of Phoenix in Arizona. Hmm, wait, that's an interesting question. Let me start\
      \ by recalling where these two states are. Florida is on the southeastern coast\
      \ of the US, right? Like, the panhandle part. Arizona is in the southwest, known\
      \ for places like Phoenix and the Grand Canyon. \n\nBut wait, even though Arizona\
      \ is a southwestern state, and Florida is southeastern, I need to check their\
      \ longitudes. Because when determining east or west, longitude is the key. The\
      \ higher the longitude (more west), the further west the location is. So if\
      \ Florida State University has a higher longitude than the University of Phoenix,\
      \ then it would be west of it. But that seems counterintuitive because Arizona\
      \ is considered the west, and Florida is the east.\n\nLet me check the longitude\
      \ of Tallahassee, where Florida State University is. Tallahassee is the capital\
      \ of Florida. I think its coordinates are approximately 84.28\xB0 W. For Phoenix,\
      \ Arizona, the University of Phoenix is probably in Phoenix city, right? Phoenix's\
      \ longitude is around 112.07\xB0 W. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, no,\
      \ Phoenix, AZ is in the Mountain Time Zone, which is UTC-7, while Florida is\
      \ in Eastern Time, UTC-5. But longitude-wise, each 15 degrees is roughly an\
      \ hour difference. So Eastern Time is around 75\xB0 W (like New York is around\
      \ 74\xB0 W). But Tallahassee is in the Florida panhandle, which is more western\
      \ part of Florida. So maybe around 84\xB0 W. Phoenix, AZ, on the other hand,\
      \ is in the southwestern part, so its longitude would be higher, like around\
      \ 112\xB0 W. Wait, but 112\xB0 W would be further west than, say, Denver, which\
      \ is around 105\xB0 W. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some numbers here.\n\nWait,\
      \ let me verify. The University of Phoenix's main campus is in Phoenix, Arizona.\
      \ The coordinates for Phoenix, AZ are approximately 33.45\xB0 N latitude and\
      \ 112.07\xB0 W longitude. Florida State University in Tallahassee, FL has coordinates\
      \ around 30.44\xB0 N latitude and 84.28\xB0 W longitude. So longitude for Phoenix\
      \ is 112.07\xB0 W and for Tallahassee is 84.28\xB0 W. \n\nSince longitude west\
      \ increases as you go west, the higher the number, the further west. So 112\xB0\
      \ W is much further west than 84\xB0 W. That means Phoenix, AZ is west of Tallahassee,\
      \ FL. Therefore, Florida State University (in Tallahassee) is east of the University\
      \ of Phoenix in Arizona. So the answer would be NO, Florida State is not west\
      \ of University of Phoenix. Instead, it's significantly east.\n</think>NO  \n\
      **Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Locations**: Florida State University\

      Wait, longitude lines run from the prime meridian (0 degrees) eastward to 180\

    194d0111-2596-49f5-ac61-bff4a81d4dc8: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user is asking if the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA)\

      \ College of Veterinary Medicine, also in New York. They want a clear yes or\
      \ no answer, but it requires some steps to figure out.\n\nFirst, I need to recall\
      \ where these two institutions are located. Let's start with Columbia University.\
      \ I know that Columbia's main campus is in Manhattan, New York City. Specifically,\
      \ Morningside Heights, which is on the west side of Manhattan. SIPA is part\
      \ of Columbia, so it should be at the main campus. So, SIPA is in Manhattan,\
      \ NYC.\n\nNow, Cornell University is a bit different. Cornell is part of the\
      \ Ivy League, but its main campus is in Ithaca, New York, which is upstate.\
      \ The College of Veterinary Medicine is one of Cornell's colleges, so it's located\
      \ in Ithaca as well. Ithaca is in the central part of New York State, west of\
      \ the Hudson River but east of some other parts. Wait, but where exactly is\
      \ Ithaca in relation to NYC?\n\nNew York City is in the southeastern part of\
      \ New York State. Ithaca is in the Finger Lakes region, which is more towards\
      \ the central-western part of the state. So, if you look at a map, Ithaca is\
      \ northwest of New York City. But wait, is that accurate? Let me think. If you\
      \ take NYC as a reference point, Ithaca is indeed to the northwest. So, Cornell's\
      \ vet school is in Ithaca, which is northwest of NYC.\n\nNow, the question is\
      \ whether Columbia's SIPA (in NYC) is west of Cornell's vet school (in Ithaca).\
      \ Since Ithaca is northwest of NYC, that would mean that NYC is southeast of\
      \ Ithaca. Therefore, Columbia's location in NYC is actually to the southeast\
      \ of Cornell's Ithaca campus. So, if SIPA is in NYC and Cornell's vet school\
      \ is in Ithaca, then SIPA is east of Cornell's vet school, not west. Therefore,\
      \ the answer should be no.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the exact locations.\
      \ Maybe there's a chance that Ithaca is more north than west? Let me confirm\
      \ the coordinates. New York City is at approximately 40.7128\xB0 N, 74.0060\xB0\
      \ W. Ithaca is around 42.4440\xB0 N, 76.5019\xB0 W. Comparing the longitude:\
      \ NYC is at 74.0060\xB0 W, and Ithaca is at 76.5019\xB0 W. Since longitude increases\
      \ as you go west, a higher degree west means further west. So Ithaca is at 76.5\xB0\
      \ W, which is west of NYC's 74\xB0 W. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier\
      \ thought. Wait, no, wait. If the longitude is a higher number west, that means\
      \ it's further west. So, 76.5\xB0 W is west of 74\xB0 W. So Ithaca is west of\
      \ NYC. Therefore, Cornell's vet school in Ithaca is west of Columbia's SIPA\
      \ in NYC. Therefore, the original question is asking if SIPA is west of Cornell's\
      \ vet school. Since Ithaca is west of NYC, that would mean that SIPA (NYC) is\
      \ east of Cornell (Ithaca). Therefore, the answer is NO, SIPA is not west of\
      \ Cornell's vet school; it's east.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier.\
      \ Let me clarify. Longitude: lower numbers are further east. So, NYC is at 74\xB0\
      \ W, Ithaca at 76.5\xB0 W. Since 76.5 is a higher number, that's further west.\
      \ So Ithaca is west of NYC. Therefore, Cornell's vet school is west of Columbia's\
      \ SIPA. Therefore, the question is asking if SIPA is west of Cornell's vet school.\
      \ Since SIPA is in NYC (74\xB0 W) and Cornell is at 76.5\xB0 W, SIPA is east\
      \ of Cornell. So the answer is NO.\n</think>NO  \nColumbia University's School\

      \ for Manhattan). Ithaca is at 42.4440\xB0 N, 76.5019\xB0 W. Wait, but longitude\
      \ is measured in degrees west, so negative values. So NYC's longitude is approximately\
      \ -73.9851 (Manhattan), and Ithaca's is about -76.5019. So -76.5 is more west\
      \ than -73.9. So Ithaca is west of NYC. Therefore, Cornell's vet school in Ithaca\

    2b555885-608a-4d20-9a42-6e72ae4335a3: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The user wants to know if the School of International and Public\
      \ Affairs (SIPA) at Columbia University in New York is located west of the Cornell\
      \ University College of Veterinary Medicine, also in New York. \n\nFirst, I\
      \ need to figure out where each of these schools is located. Columbia University\
      \ is a well-known Ivy League school in New York City, specifically in Manhattan.\
      \ I remember that Columbia's main campus is in the Morningside Heights neighborhood,\
      \ which is on the west side of Manhattan. SIPA is part of Columbia, so it's\
      \ likely situated on the main campus.\n\nNow, Cornell University is a bit different.\
      \ While it's an Ivy League school too, its main campus is in Ithaca, New York,\
      \ which is upstate, about a four-hour drive northwest of NYC. The College of\
      \ Veterinary Medicine is one of Cornell's colleges, so it's probably located\
      \ on the main campus in Ithaca.\n\nNext, I need to determine the geographical\
      \ positions. Manhattan, where Columbia is, is in the southeastern part of New\
      \ York State. Ithaca, where Cornell is, is in the central part of the state,\
      \ more towards the west compared to NYC. Wait, but when considering directions,\
      \ west is a relative term. If I look at a map, Ithaca is northwest of New York\
      \ City. So, the question is whether Columbia (in NYC) is west of Cornell's vet\
      \ school in Ithaca.\n\nBut wait, since Ithaca is northwest of NYC, that would\
      \ mean that NYC is southeast of Ithaca. Therefore, Columbia's location in NYC\
      \ would be to the southeast of Cornell's vet school. So, the answer would be\
      \ no, because west is the opposite direction. If Ithaca is northwest of NYC,\
      \ then NYC is southeast of Ithaca, making SIPA (Columbia) east of Cornell's\
      \ vet school, not west.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check the exact coordinates.\
      \ Let me recall: Columbia University's coordinates are approximately 40.8075\xB0\
      \ N, 73.9626\xB0 W. Cornell University in Ithaca is around 42.4484\xB0 N, 76.4792\xB0\
      \ W. \n\nLongitude measures east-west position, with more negative (or higher\
      \ in the west) meaning further west. Since Cornell's longitude is -76.4792 and\
      \ Columbia's is -73.9626, Cornell is further west because -76 is less than -73\
      \ (since it's more negative). Therefore, Columbia is east of Cornell. So the\
      \ answer is NO, SIPA is not west of Cornell's vet school; it's east.\n</think>NO\
      \  \nColumbia University's School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA)\

      \ University College of Veterinary Medicine is in Ithaca, NY (longitude \u2248\
      \ -76.48\xB0W). Since lower longitude values (less negative) denote positions\
      \ further east, Columbia is east of Cornell. Thus, SIPA is **not** west of Cornell\u2019\
      s veterinary college."

      \ So, the user wants to know if the School of International and Public Affairs\
      \ (SIPA) at Columbia University in New York is located west of the Cornell University\
      \ College of Veterinary Medicine in New York. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure\
      \ out where each of these schools is located geographically within New York\
      \ State.\n\nStarting with Columbia University. I know that Columbia's main campus\
      \ is in Manhattan, New York City. Specifically, the Morningside Heights neighborhood.\
      \ SIPA is part of Columbia, so it should be there. Now, Cornell University is\
      \ a bit different. Cornell is in Ithaca, NY, which is upstate. The College of\
      \ Veterinary Medicine is part of Cornell, so it's in Ithaca as well.\n\nNow,\
      \ the key here is to determine the relative positions of New York City and Ithaca\
      \ in terms of longitude. Since the question is about being west, longitude is\
      \ the key factor. Places with a higher longitude (more to the east) are further\
      \ east, and lower longitude (more to the west) are further west. Wait, no, actually,\
      \ longitude increases as you go east. So, a higher longitude means more east,\
      \ lower means more west.\n\nSo, I need to find the approximate longitudes of\
      \ both locations. Let me recall: New York City is on the eastern side of the\
      \ US. The longitude of NYC is around 74 degrees west. Wait, no, actually, New\
      \ York City's longitude is approximately 74 degrees west. Ithaca, NY, being\
      \ in upstate New York, is a bit further west. Let me check that. Wait, no, maybe\
      \ I'm mixing up. Let me think. The US eastern seaboard runs roughly along the\
      \ 70s west longitude. For example, Boston is around 71\xB0W, NYC is around 74\xB0\
      W. But Ithaca is in the Finger Lakes region, which is more central/western part\
      \ of New York State. So Ithaca's longitude is around 76.5\xB0W. Wait, is that\
      \ right? Let me visualize a map. New York City is on the east coast, so it's\
      \ more east (lower longitude number) compared to Ithaca, which is inland, more\
      \ to the west. Wait, no, longitude increases as you go west in the western hemisphere.\
      \ Wait, no, longitude is measured from the prime meridian (0\xB0), which goes\
      \ through Greenwich, UK. So, moving west from Greenwich, the longitude increases\
      \ up to 180\xB0W. So, in the US, all longitudes are west, so higher numbers\
      \ mean further west. So, New York City is around 74\xB0W, and Ithaca is around\
      \ 76.5\xB0W. Therefore, Ithaca is west of NYC. Therefore, Cornell's vet school\
      \ in Ithaca is west of Columbia's SIPA in NYC. Therefore, SIPA is east of Cornell\
      \ Vet School. So the question is asking if SIPA is west of Cornell Vet School.\

      \ \n\nLongitude determines how east or west a location is. Places with a higher\

      \ W. Wait, but longitude for NYC is 74.0060\xB0 W and Ithaca is 76.5019\xB0\
      \ W. Since longitude west is measured in negative degrees (if we use the convention\
      \ where west is negative), but when comparing, the more westward a place is,\
      \ the higher the numerical value in the west direction. So, 76.5\xB0 W is further\
      \ west than 74.0\xB0 W. So, Ithaca is west of New York City. Wait, but that\

    571ee6f2-f598-4634-bc07-5eb9f8130c2e: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\

      \ recall where each of these institutions is located. Columbia University is\
      \ in New York City, right? Specifically, its main campus is in Morningside Heights,\
      \ Manhattan. So SIPA, being part of Columbia, is probably in Manhattan as well.\
      \ Now, Cornell University is a bit different. Cornell's main campus is in Ithaca,\
      \ New York, which is in the Finger Lakes region, upstate. But wait, the question\
      \ is about the College of Veterinary Medicine. I think that's part of Cornell's\
      \ main campus in Ithaca. So the vet school is in Ithaca.\n\nNow, I need to determine\
      \ the geographical positions relative to each other. Manhattan is in the southeastern\
      \ part of New York State, while Ithaca is in the central part, west of the Hudson\
      \ River. Wait, but when you look at a map, Ithaca is actually to the northwest\
      \ of New York City. Let me visualize New York State. New York City is at the\
      \ southeastern tip, along the Atlantic Ocean. Ithaca is upstate, more towards\
      \ the center but still in the western part relative to the city. So if Columbia\
      \ is in NYC (Manhattan), and Cornell Vet School is in Ithaca, then we need to\
      \ compare their longitudes. \n\nThe direction from east to west is determined\
      \ by longitude; the further west a location is, the more negative its longitude\
      \ (assuming we're using the standard where longitude decreases westward in the\
      \ northern hemisphere). But more accurately, in the US, as you go west from\
      \ the prime meridian, the longitude becomes more negative. However, cities in\
      \ the US have west longitude. Wait, no. Actually, in the US, most longitudes\
      \ are west of the prime meridian, so they are expressed as negative numbers\
      \ in decimal degrees (e.g., New York City is around -74.0, and Ithaca is around\
      \ -76.5). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me check approximate coordinates.\n\
      \nColumbia University in NYC: Let's say Manhattan is around 40.8\xB0 N latitude,\
      \ -73.96\xB0 W longitude. Cornell in Ithaca is around 42.45\xB0 N, -76.48\xB0\
      \ W. So comparing the longitudes: -73.96 (Columbia) vs. -76.48 (Cornell Vet).\
      \ Since longitude becomes more negative as you go west, a more negative number\
      \ is further west. So -76.48 is more west than -73.96. Therefore, Ithaca (Cornell\
      \ Vet) is west of NYC (Columbia). Therefore, Columbia is east of Cornell Vet.\
      \ So the question is asking if SIPA (Columbia) is west of Cornell Vet. Since\
      \ Columbia is east, the answer would be NO.\n</think>NO.  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\
      \  \n1. **Locations Identified:**  \n   - Columbia University's School of International\

      \ is in Ithaca, NY (~42.45\xB0 N, -76.48\xB0 W).  \n\n2. **Longitude Comparison:**\
      \  \n   - A more negative longitude indicates a western position.  \n   - SIPA's\
      \ longitude (-73.96) is less negative than Cornell Vet's (-76.48).  \n\n3. **Conclusion:**\
      \  \n   - Since SIPA (Columbia) has a less negative longitude, it is **east**\
      \ of Cornell Vet in Ithaca. Thus, SIPA is **not west** of Cornell Vet.  \n\n\
      **Answer:** NO."
    6b598f28-4f7b-4746-8d4d-1d99ca6eb664: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\

      \ Hemisphere. Wait, no, in the US, which is west of the prime meridian, longitude\
      \ is measured as west (W), so higher numerical values (more west) would be further\
      \ west. For example, New York City is around 74\xB0W, while Ithaca is around\
      \ 76\xB0W. Wait, no, wait. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, longitude: the\
      \ prime meridian is 0\xB0, and as you go west, the longitude increases in the\
      \ west direction. So, for example, New York City is approximately 74 degrees\
      \ west longitude. Ithaca, being more to the west in New York State, would have\
      \ a higher longitude value (more west). Wait, no, actually, longitude west of\
      \ the prime meridian is denoted as negative in some systems (like decimal degrees),\
      \ but when using degrees west, it's positive. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the\
      \ notation. Let me think: if you're in the Western Hemisphere, longitude is\

      \ 74\xB0 West, and Ithaca is around 76\xB0 West. Wait, but if Ithaca is further\
      \ west than NYC, then its longitude would be a higher number (more degrees west).\
      \ So, 76\xB0W is further west than 74\xB0W. Therefore, Ithaca (Cornell) is west\

      \ no, actually, Ithaca is to the northwest of NYC. Let me confirm that. If you\
      \ look at New York State, NYC is at the southern tip, near the coast. Ithaca\
      \ is in central-western part. So from NYC, traveling northwest would get you\
      \ to Ithaca. \n\nBut the question is whether Columbia (in NYC) is west of Cornell\

      \ go east. So, if a place is further west, it has a lower longitude (more negative\
      \ if we consider the prime meridian as 0). \n\nSo, New York City is at approximately\
      \ 74.0\xB0 W longitude. Ithaca, NY is around 76.5\xB0 W longitude. Wait, but\
      \ Ithaca is further west because 76.5 is more west than 74.0. So that would\

      \ Columbia is east of Cornell. So SIPA is not west of Cornell Vet Med. Therefore,\
      \ the answer should be NO.\n\nBut let me double-check the coordinates. Maybe\

      \ \n\nSo, yes, Cornell's longitude is 76.4789\xB0 W, which is further west than\
      \ Columbia's 73.9626\xB0 W. Since west longitude becomes more negative (or higher\
      \ in absolute value) as you go west. So 76 is further west than 74. Therefore,\

      \ Cornell's main campus is in Ithaca, and the College of Veterinary Medicine\
      \ is part of that. So the coordinates for the vet school would be similar to\
      \ Cornell's main campus. Let me verify: Cornell University's coordinates are\
      \ approximately 42.4488\xB0 N, -76.4763\xB0 W. \n\nSo comparing the longitudes:\
      \ Columbia is at approximately -73.96\xB0 W, and Cornell is at around -76.47\xB0\
      \ W. Wait, but since longitude becomes more negative as you go west, -76.47\
      \ is further west than -73.96. Wait, but wait: no, actually, negative longitude\
      \ values increase (become more negative) as you go west. So -76 is more west\
      \ than -73. Therefore, Cornell in Ithaca is further west than Columbia in NYC.\
      \ So the question is: Is SIPA (Columbia) west of Cornell Vet School? If Cornell\
      \ is further west, then Columbia is east of Cornell. Therefore, the answer would\
      \ be NO, because Columbia is east of Cornell. \n\nWait, but let me make sure\
      \ I'm not mixing up the directions. Let's think in terms of numbers. The prime\
      \ meridian is 0\xB0, and moving west from there, the longitude becomes negative.\
      \ So for example, New York City is at around -74\xB0 W, which means 74 degrees\
      \ west of the prime meridian. Ithaca is at about -76.5\xB0 W. So Ithaca is 76.5\
      \ degrees west, which is further west than NYC's 74 degrees west. Therefore,\
      \ Ithaca is west of NYC. Therefore, Cornell's vet school is west of Columbia's\
      \ SIPA. Therefore, Columbia SIPA is east of Cornell Vet School, so the answer\
      \ is NO, SIPA is not west of Cornell Vet School.\n</think>NO  \nColumbia University's\
      \ School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) is located in New York City\
      \ at approximately -73.96\xB0 W longitude. Cornell University's College of Veterinary\
      \ Medicine in Ithaca, NY, is at approximately -76.47\xB0 W. Since lower (more\

      \ whether Virginia Tech in Virginia is located west of Vanderbilt University\
      \ in Tennessee. Hmm, I need to figure out the geographic locations of both universities\
      \ and compare their longitudes. \n\nFirst, I should recall where each university\
      \ is. Virginia Tech, I think, is in Blacksburg, Virginia. Vanderbilt is in Nashville,\
      \ Tennessee. Now, I need to determine the approximate longitudes of these two\
      \ cities.\n\nFrom what I remember, Virginia is on the East Coast, so its western\
      \ parts might be in the Appalachian region. Tennessee is further inland but\
      \ also in the Southeast. Nashville is in central Tennessee, while Blacksburg\
      \ is in southwestern Virginia. \n\nLongitude-wise, places further west have\
      \ more negative longitude values if we're using the Western Hemisphere standard.\
      \ So, if Blacksburg's longitude is further west (more negative) than Nashville's,\
      \ then the answer is yes. \n\nLet me try to approximate. Nashville, TN is around\
      \ 86.8 degrees West longitude. Virginia Tech in Blacksburg is at about 80.4\
      \ degrees West. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because 80 degrees West is\
      \ more east than 86. Wait, wait\u2014I might be mixing up the numbers. Let me\
      \ check that again. \n\nWait, no\u2014actually, higher numerical values in the\
      \ west are more westward in the US. For example, the East Coast is around 75-80\xB0\
      W, the Midwest is 80-90\xB0W, and the West Coast is around 120\xB0W. So, if\
      \ Blacksburg is in western Virginia, maybe around 80\xB0W. But Nashville is\
      \ in Tennessee\u2014central TN. Let me confirm the exact longitudes.\n\nBlacksburg,\
      \ VA: According to my memory, it's around 80.4\xB0 West. But wait, that can't\
      \ be right. Because cities like Pittsburgh are around 80\xB0W. Nashville is\
      \ further west. Let me think: Nashville is at approximately 86.78\xB0W. So if\
      \ Blacksburg is at, say, 80.4\xB0W, then Nashville is further west. But wait,\
      \ that would mean Virginia Tech is east of Vanderbilt. But I'm not sure if I\
      \ have the longitudes correct. \n\nWait, maybe I confused the longitude of Blacksburg.\
      \ Let me recall: Virginia's western border is around 83\xB0W. For example, Bristol,\
      \ VA is near the border with Tennessee at about 82.18\xB0W. Blacksburg is a\
      \ bit east of there, maybe around 80.4\xB0W? Wait, no\u2014maybe I'm wrong.\
      \ Let me think of cities. Roanoke, VA is near Blacksburg and is at 79.94\xB0\
      W. Wait, that's about 80\xB0W. So if Roanoke is around 80\xB0W, then Blacksburg,\
      \ being a bit west of Roanoke, would be maybe 80.4\xB0W. But Nashville is at\
      \ 86.78\xB0W. That would mean Nashville is significantly further west. So in\
      \ that case, Virginia Tech (Blacksburg) would be east of Vanderbilt (Nashville).\
      \ \n\nBut wait, I might have mixed up east and west. Longitude increases as\
      \ you go west. So a higher degree West means further west. So 86\xB0W is west\
      \ of 80\xB0W. Therefore, Nashville at 86\xB0W is west of Blacksburg at 80\xB0\
      W. So the answer would be NO, Virginia Tech is not west of Vanderbilt; it's\
      \ east.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014maybe my initial assumption about the longitudes\
      \ is wrong. Let me double-check approximate coordinates. \n\nVirginia Tech's\
      \ campus in Blacksburg, VA: According to a quick mental note, the coordinates\
      \ are approximately 37.23\xB0N, 80.42\xB0W. \n\nVanderbilt University in Nashville,\
      \ TN: approximately 36.14\xB0N, 86.80\xB0W. \n\nComparing the longitudes: 80.42\xB0\
      W (Blacksburg) vs. 86.80\xB0W (Nashville). Since 86.80 is a higher number west,\
      \ Nashville is further west. Therefore, Blacksburg is east of Nashville. Therefore,\
      \ Virginia Tech is east of Vanderbilt, so the answer is NO.\n</think>NO  \n\
      Virginia Tech is located in Blacksburg, VA at approximately 80.4\xB0W longitude,\
      \ while Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN is around 86.8\xB0W. Since longitude\
      \ increases westward, a higher numerical value (86.8\xB0W) indicates a location\
      \ further west. Thus, Virginia Tech is east of Vanderbilt University."
    0d064334-3902-458f-b8af-fc6f8925d3f8: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Virginia Tech in Virginia is located west of Vanderbilt University\
      \ in Tennessee. Hmm, I need to figure out the geographic positions of both universities.\
      \ \n\nFirst, I should recall where each university is. Virginia Tech is in Blacksburg,\
      \ Virginia. Vanderbilt is in Nashville, Tennessee. Now, I need to determine\
      \ the longitude of each city because longitude determines east-west position.\
      \ The further west a place is (higher longitude in the western hemisphere),\
      \ the more west it is.\n\nWait, longitude lines run north-south but measure\
      \ east or west. So a higher longitude value (in the west) would mean a location\
      \ is further west. But wait, actually, in the US, which is in the western hemisphere,\
      \ longitude is measured as west longitude, so it's negative numbers if using\
      \ decimal degrees. For example, places in the US have longitude values like\
      \ -75, -80, etc. So a more negative longitude (lower number when considering\
      \ negative values) would be further east, and a less negative (closer to zero)\

      \ Let me think: Nashville, TN is in the central part of Tennessee. Blacksburg,\
      \ VA is in southwestern Virginia. But how do their longitudes compare? \n\n\
      Nashville's longitude is approximately -86.78, and Blacksburg's is around -80.41.\
      \ Since -80.41 is higher (less negative) than -86.78, that would mean Blacksburg\
      \ is east of Nashville. Wait, no, because if you're moving west, the longitude\
      \ becomes more negative. So, for example, the prime meridian is 0. Going west\
      \ from there, the longitude increases in negative degrees. So a longitude of\
      \ -80 is east of -86. Therefore, Blacksburg, VA (longitude ~-80.4) is east of\
      \ Nashville, TN (longitude ~-86.78). Therefore, Virginia Tech would actually\

      \ is west of Virginia. Therefore, Vanderbilt in Nashville is west of Virginia\
      \ Tech. Therefore, Virginia Tech is east of Vanderbilt. So the original question\

      \  \n\n**Conclusion**: Blacksburg, VA (Virginia Tech) is **east** of Nashville,\
      \ TN (Vanderbilt).  \n\nANSWER: NO"
    12cf195e-92c9-4724-80fe-9561258cb7fe: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The question is whether Virginia Tech in Virginia is located\
      \ west of Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. First, I need to figure out where\
      \ exactly these two universities are situated.\n\nStarting with Virginia Tech.\
      \ I know that Virginia Tech is a major university in Virginia. The official\
      \ name is Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, commonly known\
      \ as Virginia Tech. I recall that it's located in Blacksburg, Virginia. Now,\
      \ where is Blacksburg? I think it's in the southwestern part of Virginia. To\
      \ confirm, Virginia's shape is such that the western part is more mountainous,\
      \ part of the Appalachian region. Blacksburg being in southwest Virginia would\
      \ place it near the border with states like West Virginia and maybe Tennessee?\
      \ Wait, Tennessee is south of Virginia, but the western part of Virginia is\
      \ bordered by Kentucky and West Virginia. Hmm, I might need to check the exact\
      \ location coordinates.\n\nNext, Vanderbilt University is in Nashville, Tennessee.\
      \ Nashville is the capital of Tennessee and is in the central part of the state.\
      \ Now, I need to compare the longitudes of Blacksburg, VA, and Nashville, TN.\
      \ Since longitude determines east-west position, the more westward a location\
      \ is, the lower (or more negative) its longitude will be (assuming we're using\
      \ the western hemisphere where longitudes are negative west of the Prime Meridian).\n\
      \nSo, I need to find the longitude of Blacksburg, VA, and Nashville, TN. Let's\
      \ start with Blacksburg. A quick search in my mind: I remember that Blacksburg's\
      \ coordinates are approximately 37.2296\xB0 N, 80.4139\xB0 W. For Nashville,\
      \ Vanderbilt University's coordinates are around 36.1447\xB0 N, 86.8027\xB0\
      \ W. Wait, but wait, those are the coordinates. Now, comparing the longitudes:\
      \ Blacksburg is at 80.4139\xB0 W, and Nashville is at 86.8027\xB0 W. \n\nWait,\
      \ hold on. Longitude values increase as you go west, but since they're both\
      \ in the western hemisphere (negative if we consider the sign, but often just\
      \ stated as degrees west), the higher number means further west. So, 86.8027\xB0\
      \ W is further west than 80.4139\xB0 W. So Nashville (Vanderbilt) is at a higher\
      \ longitude (more west) than Blacksburg (Virginia Tech). Therefore, Virginia\
      \ Tech would be east of Vanderbilt University. \n\nBut let me double-check to\
      \ avoid confusion. If a place has a higher numerical value in degrees west,\
      \ it's further west. For example, 90\xB0W is further west than 80\xB0W. So Nashville\
      \ at ~86.8\xB0W is west of Blacksburg at ~80.4\xB0W. Therefore, Virginia Tech\
      \ is east of Vanderbilt. So the answer would be NO, Virginia Tech is not west\
      \ of Vanderbilt; it's east.\n</think>NO  \nVirginia Tech is located in Blacksburg,\
      \ VA (longitude ~80.4\xB0 W), while Vanderbilt University is in Nashville, TN\
      \ (longitude ~86.8\xB0 W). Since lower longitude values (e.g., 80\xB0 vs. 86\xB0\
      ) are farther east, Virginia Tech lies east of Vanderbilt.  \n\n**Answer:**\
      \ NO"
    49cb15d1-7a63-43bc-8097-6655bf9ea381: "<think>Alright, let's try to figure out\
      \ if Virginia Tech in Virginia is west of Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.\
      \ Okay, first I need to know where exactly both universities are located. \n\
      \nVirginia Tech, I think it's in Blacksburg, Virginia. And Vanderbilt is in\
      \ Nashville, Tennessee. So I need to compare their longitudes because longitude\
      \ determines east-west position. The one with a higher longitude (more to the\
      \ west) would be further west. \n\nWait, but sometimes cities can be in different\
      \ states but relative positions might not be obvious. Let me recall: Tennessee\
      \ is to the south of Kentucky, and Virginia is to the east of Tennessee? Or\
      \ is it the other way around? Wait, no. Virginia is to the east of Tennessee.\
      \ Because if you look at the US map, Tennessee borders North Carolina to the\
      \ east, and Virginia is north of North Carolina. So Virginia is northeast of\
      \ Tennessee. Therefore, Nashville, TN is probably further west than Blacksburg,\
      \ VA. \n\nBut maybe I should check the actual coordinates. Let me think about\
      \ the approximate longitudes. Blacksburg, VA is in western Virginia, near the\
      \ border with West Virginia. Its longitude is around -80.4 degrees. Nashville,\
      \ TN is in central Tennessee, so maybe around -86.8 degrees. Wait, longitude\
      \ is measured from the prime meridian, so more negative means further west in\
      \ the Western Hemisphere. So -86.8 is more west than -80.4. So Nashville is\
      \ west of Blacksburg. Therefore, Vanderbilt University in Nashville would be\
      \ west of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. Wait, but the question is asking if Virginia\
      \ Tech is west of Vanderbilt. Since Vanderbilt is at -86.8 and Virginia Tech\
      \ is at -80.4, Virginia Tech is actually east of Vanderbilt. Because -80.4 is\
      \ less negative than -86.8, meaning it's further east. So the answer would be\
      \ NO, Virginia Tech is not west of Vanderbilt. It's east.\n\nWait, but maybe\
      \ I got the longitudes mixed up. Let me confirm. For example, Nashville, TN's\
      \ longitude is approximately 36.1627\xB0 N, 86.7816\xB0 W. Blacksburg, VA is\
      \ 37.2296\xB0 N, 80.4139\xB0 W. So comparing the longitudes: 80.4139 W vs 86.7816\
      \ W. Since 80.41 is less than 86.78 in terms of West longitude (i.e., closer\
      \ to the prime meridian), Blacksburg is east of Nashville. Therefore, Virginia\
      \ Tech (Blacksburg) is east of Vanderbilt (Nashville). So the answer is NO.\n\
      </think>NO  \nVirginia Tech is located in Blacksburg, VA, at approximately 80.4\xB0\
      \ W longitude, while Vanderbilt University is in Nashville, TN, at around 86.8\xB0\
      \ W longitude. Since lower (less negative) longitude values are further east,\
      \ Virginia Tech (80.4\xB0 W) lies east of Vanderbilt (86.8\xB0 W). Thus, Virginia\
      \ Tech is **not** west of Vanderbilt University."
    635731cb-4fcd-45cb-8e22-b526b7f43759: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure this out.\
      \ The question is whether Virginia Tech in Virginia is located west of Vanderbilt\
      \ University in Tennessee. Hmm, I need to compare their geographical positions.\n\
      \nFirst, I should probably figure out where each university is located. Virginia\
      \ Tech is in Virginia, right? I think the full name is Virginia Polytechnic\
      \ Institute and State University, commonly known as Virginia Tech. Its main\
      \ campus is in Blacksburg, Virginia. Then Vanderbilt University is in Nashville,\
      \ Tennessee. So I need to determine if Blacksburg, VA is west of Nashville,\
      \ TN.\n\nNow, I need to look at the longitude of both cities because longitude\
      \ determines east-west position. The further west a location is, the higher\
      \ its longitude value (in the western hemisphere). Wait, no, actually in the\
      \ United States, which is in the western hemisphere, longitude is measured as\
      \ west of the prime meridian. So cities in the US have longitude values that\
      \ are negative when expressed in decimal degrees, like -80 degrees or something.\
      \ But when comparing, a more negative (lower) longitude is further west, while\
      \ a less negative (higher) longitude is further east. Wait, that's a bit confusing.\
      \ Let me think again.\n\nIn terms of longitude, the Earth is divided into 180\
      \ degrees east and 180 degrees west of the prime meridian (which is 0\xB0).\
      \ For the US, all locations are west of the prime meridian, so their longitudes\
      \ are in the west, often written as negative numbers in decimal formats. For\
      \ example, New York City is around -74.0060, which is 74 degrees west. So, if\
      \ one place has a longitude of, say, -80 and another is -86, the -86 is further\
      \ west because it's a larger number in the negative direction. Wait, actually,\
      \ numerically, -80 is greater than -86. So, in terms of west-ness, the more\
      \ west you go, the lower the numerical value (since -86 is less than -80). So,\
      \ if Blacksburg has a more western longitude (i.e., a lower number) than Nashville,\
      \ then it is west of Nashville.\n\nLet me look up the approximate longitudes.\
      \ \n\nBlacksburg, VA: I recall that Virginia is on the East Coast, but the western\
      \ part of the state. Virginia Tech is in southwestern Virginia. Maybe its longitude\
      \ is around -80.4 or something. Let me check my memory. Wait, for example, Roanoke,\
      \ VA is at around -79.9, but Blacksburg is a bit west of Roanoke. So maybe around\
      \ -80.4 degrees.\n\nNashville, TN: Tennessee is west of Virginia, but Nashville\
      \ is in the central part of Tennessee. The longitude for Nashville is approximately\
      \ -86.8 degrees. Wait, no, that seems too far. Wait, let's think: Tennessee\
      \ is to the west of Virginia, but Nashville is in the middle of Tennessee. For\
      \ example, Memphis, TN is around -90 degrees, so Nashville should be somewhere\
      \ in between. Let me check: Nashville's coordinates are approximately 36.1627\xB0\
      \ N, 86.7816\xB0 W. So longitude is about -86.78. \n\nBlacksburg, VA coordinates:\
      \ 37.2296\xB0 N, 80.4139\xB0 W. So longitude is approximately -80.41. \n\nComparing\
      \ the two: Nashville is at -86.78, Blacksburg at -80.41. Since -86.78 is lower\
      \ (more negative) than -80.41, that means Nashville is further west. Therefore,\
      \ Blacksburg, VA (Virginia Tech) is east of Nashville, TN (Vanderbilt). Therefore,\

      \ the case, then Nashville at 86.8\xB0W is further west. Because a higher longitude\
      \ (more negative in decimal, but when we talk degrees west, higher number means\
      \ further west). So 86.8\xB0W is west of 80.3\xB0W. Therefore, Nashville (Vanderbilt)\
      \ is west of Blacksburg (Virginia Tech). Therefore, Virginia Tech is east of\
      \ Vanderbilt. So the answer would be NO, Virginia Tech is not west of Vanderbilt;\
      \ it's east.\n</think>Virginia Tech is located in Blacksburg, VA, which has\
      \ a longitude of approximately **80.4\xB0W**. Vanderbilt University is in Nashville,\
      \ TN, with a longitude of approximately **86.8\xB0W**. Since lower numerical\
      \ values for longitude (closer to 0\xB0) indicate a more easterly position,\
      \ Blacksburg (80.4\xB0W) is east of Nashville (86.8\xB0W). \n\nANSWER: NO"
    8cfd6ae5-26d6-4675-94e3-17bcd4215742: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Virginia Tech in Virginia is located west of Vanderbilt University\
      \ in Tennessee. Hmm. I need to figure out the geographic positions of these\
      \ two schools. \n\nFirst, I should probably confirm where exactly each university\
      \ is located. Virginia Tech, I think, is in Blacksburg, Virginia. Vanderbilt\
      \ University is in Nashville, Tennessee. Right? So the cities are Blacksburg,\
      \ VA and Nashville, TN. Now I need to determine their longitudes because west\
      \ and east are determined by longitude. The further west a location is (lower\
      \ longitude in the western hemisphere), the more west it is.\n\nSo, let me recall\
      \ or look up the approximate coordinates. But since I can't look it up, I have\
      \ to remember. Nashville is in central Tennessee. Tennessee is to the west of\
      \ Virginia, right? Because Virginia is on the East Coast, and Tennessee is just\
      \ west of North Carolina, which is south of Virginia. Wait, but the actual longitude\
      \ might be different because Virginia extends pretty far west too. For example,\
      \ the western part of Virginia is in the Appalachian area. Blacksburg is in\
      \ southwestern Virginia. Nashville is in middle Tennessee. So which is further\
      \ west?\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the states' relative positions.\
      \ Tennessee is to the southwest of Virginia. So if Virginia Tech is in the western\
      \ part of Virginia, maybe it's closer to Tennessee. But does Blacksburg's longitude\
      \ extend further west than Nashville's?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Nashville\
      \ is further west. Let me think of major cities. For example, Richmond is the\
      \ capital of Virginia, which is in the eastern part. Blacksburg is way west\
      \ of Richmond. Tennessee's eastern border is with North Carolina, and Nashville\
      \ is maybe in the middle of Tennessee. Let's approximate: the longitude of Blacksburg,\
      \ VA. Let me think about the US time zones. Eastern Time Zone includes all of\
      \ Virginia and most of Tennessee, but the western part of Tennessee might be\
      \ Central Time? Wait, no. Actually, Tennessee is split between Eastern and Central\
      \ time zones. But Nashville is in the Central Time Zone. Wait, no\u2014that's\
      \ incorrect. Let me correct that. Tennessee is split, but most of the state,\
      \ including Nashville, is in the Central Time Zone. However, the eastern part\
      \ of Tennessee is in the Eastern Time Zone. Wait, maybe that's another point\
      \ of confusion. If Nashville is in Central Time, that would mean it's west of\
      \ the Eastern Time Zone line. Whereas Virginia is entirely in the Eastern Time\
      \ Zone. But if Virginia Tech is in western Virginia, maybe its longitude is\
      \ around 80 degrees west? And Nashville might be around 86 degrees west. Wait,\
      \ longitude increases as you go west in the western hemisphere. So a higher\
      \ longitude number (more west) would be further west. Wait no, wait\u2014longitude\
      \ is measured from the prime meridian. So for the US, which is west of the prime\
      \ meridian, all longitudes are west (negative if using signed, but sometimes\
      \ expressed as degrees west). So, for example, New York is around 74\xB0W, Chicago\
      \ around 87\xB0W, Los Angeles around 118\xB0W. So higher numbers (when expressed\
      \ as degrees west) mean further west. So if Blacksburg is in western Virginia,\
      \ maybe around 80\xB0W, and Nashville is in Tennessee, which is to the west,\
      \ maybe around 86\xB0W. If that's the case, then Nashville is further west than\
      \ Blacksburg, meaning Virginia Tech (Blacksburg) is east of Vanderbilt (Nashville).\
      \ Therefore, the answer would be NO, Virginia Tech is not west of Vanderbilt\u2014\
      it's east.\n\nWait, but maybe my estimates of the longitudes are off. Let me\
      \ think again. For example, maybe Blacksburg's longitude is more like 80.4\xB0\
      W. Nashville's is around 86.78\xB0W. So 86 is further west than 80, so Nashville\
      \ is west. Therefore, Virginia Tech is east of Vanderbilt. So the answer is\
      \ NO.\n</think>To determine if Virginia Tech (Blacksburg, VA) is west of Vanderbilt\
      \ University (Nashville, TN):  \n1. **Locations**: Virginia Tech is in **Blacksburg,\
      \ VA** (southwestern Virginia), and Vanderbilt is in **Nashville, TN** (central\

      \ A higher longitude (west) value means further west. Nashville (86.8\xB0W)\
      \ has a greater longitude than Blacksburg (80.4\xB0W), placing it farther west.\
      \  \n\n**Answer**: NO. Virginia Tech is east of Vanderbilt University."
    97391a09-19df-4635-821b-992d4cae7d12: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Virginia Tech in Virginia is located west of Vanderbilt University\
      \ in Tennessee. Hmm, I need to figure out their geographic locations.\n\nFirst,\
      \ I should recall where each university is. Virginia Tech, officially known\
      \ as Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, is in Blacksburg,\
      \ Virginia. Vanderbilt University is in Nashville, Tennessee. Got that down.\
      \ \n\nNow, I need to determine the longitude of both places because longitude\
      \ determines east-west position. The further west a location's longitude (more\
      \ negative if we consider west as negative), the further west it is. \n\nI remember\
      \ that the eastern United States has longitudes in the negative range when using\
      \ the decimal degrees system, where the prime meridian is 0. For example, New\
      \ York is around -74 degrees, and Chicago is around -87 degrees. So, moving\
      \ west, the longitude becomes more negative (or lower in numerical value if\
      \ we ignore the sign). Wait, actually, longitude coordinates in the western\
      \ hemisphere are measured west from the prime meridian, so they're negative\
      \ in decimal degrees. So a more westerly location would have a longitude that's\
      \ a smaller number (more negative) compared to a less westerly one. \n\nSo I\
      \ need the exact or approximate longitudes of Blacksburg, VA and Nashville,\
      \ TN. Let me think. Blacksburg is in southwestern Virginia. Nashville is in\
      \ central Tennessee. If I picture a map of the eastern US, Virginia is to the\
      \ east of Tennessee. Wait, no. Wait, Tennessee is south of Kentucky, which is\
      \ south of the Midwest states. But Virginia is on the East Coast, but it's also\
      \ south of Maryland. Wait, actually, Tennessee shares a border with Virginia.\
      \ Let me visualize: Virginia is to the east of Tennessee? Wait, no. Because\
      \ if you look at a map, Tennessee is to the west of North Carolina, and Virginia\
      \ is north of North Carolina. So Tennessee is southwest of Virginia. Wait, maybe\
      \ not. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the US map: Virginia\
      \ is on the east coast, bordered by the Atlantic. Tennessee is inland, to the\
      \ west of North Carolina. So moving from Virginia to Tennessee would be moving\
      \ west. So Nashville, TN would be west of Virginia. But wait, Virginia Tech\
      \ is in Blacksburg, which is in southwestern Virginia. So perhaps Blacksburg\
      \ is close to the border with Tennessee? Let me check approximate locations.\
      \ \n\nBlacksburg, VA is near the western part of Virginia, near the border with\
      \ West Virginia and maybe close to Tennessee. Wait, Tennessee borders Virginia\
      \ to the south. Let me confirm: Virginia's southern border is with North Carolina\
      \ and Tennessee. The southwestern tip of Virginia borders Tennessee. So Blacksburg\
      \ is in Montgomery County, Virginia. Looking at a map, Montgomery County is\
      \ in the southwestern part of Virginia, near the border with West Virginia (to\
      \ the north) and maybe close to the Tennessee border. But how far is Blacksburg\
      \ from the Tennessee state line? \n\nNashville is in central Tennessee. So if\
      \ Virginia Tech is in southwestern Virginia, and Nashville is in central Tennessee,\
      \ then Nashville would be southwest of Blacksburg. Wait, but longitude is the\
      \ key. Let me get approximate longitudes. \n\nBlacksburg, VA has a longitude\
      \ of approximately -80.4 degrees. Nashville, TN's longitude is approximately\
      \ -86.8 degrees. Wait, but wait\u2014that can't be right. Because, for example,\
      \ Chicago is around -87.6, so Nashville being at -86.8 would be east of Chicago\
      \ but still in the central time zone. Wait, but actually, Tennessee is split\
      \ between Eastern and Central time zones. Nashville is in the Central Time Zone,\
      \ so its longitude should be around -86.8. However, Blacksburg, VA is in the\
      \ Eastern Time Zone, so its longitude is maybe around -80.4. \n\nWait, but longitude-wise,\
      \ the more negative the value, the further west. So if Blacksburg is at -80.4\
      \ and Nashville is at -86.8, then Nashville is further west because -86.8 is\
      \ less than -80.4 (i.e., more negative). Therefore, Nashville (Vanderbilt) is\
      \ west of Blacksburg (Virginia Tech). Therefore, Virginia Tech is east of Vanderbilt.\
      \ So the answer would be NO, Virginia Tech is not west of Vanderbilt; it's east.\
      \ \n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check those longitudes. Maybe I got them\
      \ mixed up. Let me think of another way. If I recall, the approximate longitude\
      \ for Nashville. For example, Atlanta, GA is around -84.3. Nashville is west\
      \ of Atlanta, so its longitude should be more west (more negative). So if Atlanta\
      \ is -84.3, Nashville would be -86.8. That's possible. Blacksburg, being in\
      \ Virginia, is east of Tennessee. So its longitude would be higher (less negative).\
      \ For example, Washington, DC is around -77.0. Roanoke, VA, which is near Blacksburg,\
      \ has a longitude of about -79.9. So Roanoke is -79.9. Blacksburg is a bit further\
      \ west? Let me check. \n\nLooking it up mentally, Blacksburg's coordinates are\
      \ approximately 37.2296\xB0 N, 80.4139\xB0 W. So longitude is -80.4139. \n\n\
      Nashville's coordinates are approximately 36.1627\xB0 N, 86.7816\xB0 W. So longitude\
      \ is -86.7816. \n\nComparing the two: -80.41 vs. -86.78. Since longitude is\
      \ measured from 0\xB0 at Greenwich, moving west to 180\xB0W. In decimal degrees,\
      \ west longitudes are negative. So the more negative the longitude, the further\
      \ west. Therefore, -86.78 is more west than -80.41. \n\nTherefore, Vanderbilt\
      \ in Nashville, TN (-86.78) is west of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA (-80.41).\
      \ Therefore, Virginia Tech is east of Vanderbilt. Therefore, the answer is NO,\
      \ Virginia Tech is not west of Vanderbilt.\n</think>NO  \nVirginia Tech is located\
      \ in Blacksburg, VA, at approximately **-80.41\xB0 longitude**, while Vanderbilt\
      \ University is in Nashville, TN, at approximately **-86.78\xB0 longitude**.\
      \ Since lower (more negative) longitude values indicate a location further west,\
      \ Vanderbilt (TN) lies west of Virginia Tech (VA). Thus, Virginia Tech is **not**\
      \ west of Vanderbilt."
    b3981bb1-e863-4fbc-bbe3-9c65419957b9: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Virginia Tech in Virginia is west of Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. Let\
      \ me start by recalling where these two states are located. Virginia is on the\
      \ East Coast, bordering the Atlantic Ocean, and Tennessee is just west of North\
      \ Carolina and south of Kentucky. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact positions.\
      \ Let me visualize a map. Virginia is to the north of North Carolina, right?\
      \ And Tennessee is west of North Carolina. So Virginia is more east, and Tennessee\
      \ is a bit westward. But maybe I should check the longitudes of the specific\
      \ cities where these universities are located.\n\nVirginia Tech is located in\
      \ Blacksburg, VA. Vanderbilt is in Nashville, TN. To determine which is further\
      \ west, I need their longitude coordinates. Places further west have higher\
      \ longitude values (more negative if using the western hemisphere notation,\
      \ but sometimes it's measured as degrees west). Alternatively, in the US, as\
      \ we go from east to west, the longitude becomes more west (i.e., higher in\
      \ negative numbers if using the negative west of the Prime Meridian). \n\nLet\
      \ me think: The Prime Meridian is 0\xB0, and the US is west of that, so longitude\
      \ is negative when using the format where east is positive and west is negative.\
      \ So, a lower (more negative) longitude value would mean further west. Wait,\
      \ no, wait: If you're in the US, longitude is measured in degrees west, but\
      \ typically expressed as a negative number. For example, New York City is around\
      \ -74\xB0 longitude, and Los Angeles is around -118\xB0. So the more negative\
      \ the number, the further west. Therefore, the city with the more western longitude\
      \ (more negative) is further west.\n\nSo, I need to find the longitude of Blacksburg,\
      \ VA, and Nashville, TN. Let me try to recall or estimate. \n\nBlacksburg, VA:\
      \ I think it's in southwestern Virginia. Since Virginia is on the East Coast,\
      \ but Blacksburg is in the western part of the state. Nashville is in central\
      \ Tennessee. Tennessee is west of Virginia as a state, but because Virginia\
      \ extends pretty far west, maybe Blacksburg is actually further west than Nashville?\
      \ Wait, that seems counterintuitive. Let me check approximate longitudes.\n\n\
      From memory, Nashville, TN is around 86.8\xB0 West longitude. Let me confirm\
      \ that. Wait, for example, Nashville's coordinates are approximately 36.1627\xB0\
      \ N, 86.7816\xB0 W. So longitude is -86.78. \n\nBlacksburg, VA's coordinates\
      \ are approximately 37.2296\xB0 N, 80.4139\xB0 W. So longitude is -80.41. \n\
      \nComparing the two longitudes: -80.41 (Blacksburg) vs. -86.78 (Nashville).\
      \ Since -80.41 is less negative than -86.78, that means Blacksburg is east of\
      \ Nashville. Wait, no. Wait, in terms of west longitude, a higher numerical\
      \ value (more negative) is further west. So -86.78 is more west than -80.41.\
      \ Therefore, Vanderbilt in Nashville, TN is west of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg,\
      \ VA. Therefore, Virginia Tech is east of Vanderbilt. So the question was, is\

      \ is part of the Boston area. Syracuse University is in Syracuse, New York.\
      \ \n\nNow, I need to find the approximate longitudes of both places. Let me\
      \ think. Boston is on the east coast of the US, so its longitude is around 71\
      \ degrees west. Syracuse is in upstate New York, more towards the western part\

      \ Wait, Boston is actually east of NYC. So Boston has a more easterly longitude,\
      \ which would be a smaller number in west longitude. Because as you go east\
      \ in the US, the longitude decreases (since you're moving towards the prime\
      \ meridian). So, for example, Syracuse, NY, is further west than Boston, MA.\
      \ Wait, is that true? Let me check mentally. Syracuse is in upstate New York,\
      \ which is north and west of NYC. Boston is in eastern Massachusetts. So Syracuse\
      \ would be west of Boston. Therefore, MIT (in Cambridge, near Boston) would\
      \ be east of Syracuse University. Therefore, the answer would be NO, MIT is\

      \ Syracuse, NY is around 76 degrees west. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, New\
      \ York City is around 74 degrees west. Syracuse is further north and west in\
      \ NY state. So maybe around 76 degrees west. So if Boston is 71, then Syracuse\
      \ is 76. So Boston is at 71\xB0W, Syracuse at 76\xB0W. Since lower longitude\
      \ (more east) means being further east. So Boston is east of Syracuse. Therefore,\
      \ MIT (in Boston area) is east of Syracuse University. So the question is asking\

      \ which is in the Western Hemisphere, longitudes are west of the prime meridian,\
      \ so they are denoted as degrees west (W). So a higher degree west would mean\
      \ further west. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nLongitude\
      \ lines run from the prime meridian (0 degrees) east to 180 degrees east and\
      \ west to 180 degrees west. But in the US, all longitudes are west of the prime\

      \ west longitude, so actually, the more west you go, the higher the longitude\
      \ number (since it's degrees west of the prime meridian). Wait, no, that might\
      \ not be right. Let me clarify: Longitude is measured from 0\xB0 at the prime\

      \ is to compare which of the two cities has a more westerly longitude. If MIT\
      \ is further west than Syracuse, then the answer is yes; otherwise, no.\n\n\
      So let's look up the approximate longitudes. Let me recall: Boston, MA is on\

      ; Syracuse is in upstate New York, so further west. So its longitude would be\
      \ around -76.2\xB0 or maybe -76. So if MIT is at -71, and Syracuse is at -76,\
      \ then the more west would be the one with the more negative value, right? Wait,\
      \ in terms of west longitude, higher numerical value (without the sign) means\
      \ further west. So -76.2 is further west than -71.1. Because 76.2 degrees west\
      \ is more westward than 71.1 degrees west. Therefore, Syracuse is west of MIT.\
      \ So MIT is east of Syracuse. Therefore, the answer is NO, MIT is not west of\

    08a3c8f1-b456-4120-9bc1-1e1c85403548: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user is asking if Boston University in Massachusetts is located west\
      \ of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) in California. Hmm,\
      \ at first glance, that seems a bit counterintuitive because California is on\
      \ the West Coast and Massachusetts is on the East Coast. But maybe there's a\
      \ trick here? Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall\
      \ the general geography of the United States. The country is divided into eastern\
      \ and western halves, with the Mississippi River often considered a rough dividing\
      \ line, but more accurately, it's the longitudinal lines that matter. The prime\
      \ meridian is in Greenwich, England, and longitude increases as you go east\
      \ or west from there. In the US, the eastern states have lower longitude values\
      \ (west of the prime meridian, so negative values) compared to the western states.\
      \ Wait, no, actually, all longitudes in the US are west of the prime meridian,\
      \ so they're all negative. The further west you go, the more negative the longitude\
      \ becomes. Wait, no, longitude is measured from 0\xB0 at the prime meridian\
      \ to 180\xB0E and 180\xB0W. But in the US, all locations are west of the prime\
      \ meridian, so their longitude is measured in degrees west, which would be negative\
      \ values in decimal notation. For example, New York is around 74\xB0W (which\
      \ is -74), and San Francisco is around 122\xB0W (-122). So, the more westward\
      \ a location is, the higher the numerical value in negative terms. Wait, no,\
      \ actually, longitude decreases as you go east. So, moving west from the prime\
      \ meridian, longitude becomes more negative. So, San Francisco, being on the\
      \ West Coast, has a more negative longitude (around -122.4) compared to Boston,\
      \ which is on the East Coast, around -71.1. Therefore, San Francisco is west\
      \ of Boston. So, Boston University (in Boston, MA) would be east of UCSF (San\
      \ Francisco, CA). Therefore, the answer should be NO, Boston University is not\
      \ west of UCSF; it's east.\n\nBut let me double-check the exact coordinates\
      \ to be sure. Let me look up the coordinates of both universities. \n\nBoston\
      \ University's main campus is in Boston, MA. The approximate coordinates are\
      \ 42.3505\xB0 N, 71.1054\xB0 W. \n\nUniversity of California, San Francisco's\
      \ main campus is in San Francisco, CA. The coordinates are approximately 37.7626\xB0\
      \ N, 122.4580\xB0 W. \n\nComparing the longitudes: Boston is at -71.1054, and\
      \ UCSF is at -122.4580. Since longitude is measured west from the prime meridian,\
      \ a more negative (i.e., lower) value means further west. Wait, no, actually,\
      \ longitude is measured in degrees west, so a higher number in the west direction\
      \ means a larger degree value. For example, 122\xB0W is further west than 71\xB0\
      W. So, in terms of numerical values, -122.4580 is more negative than -71.1054.\
      \ When comparing west-east positions, the location with the more negative longitude\
      \ (i.e., a smaller number when considering negative values) is further west.\
      \ Wait, this is where confusion might happen. Let me clarify: \n\nLongitude\
      \ values increase as you move east from the prime meridian (positive) and decrease\
      \ as you move west (negative). But when considering absolute positions, a longitude\
      \ of 122\xB0W (which is -122.4580) is further west than 71\xB0W (-71.1054).\
      \ So, San Francisco is at a higher degree west longitude than Boston. Therefore,\
      \ San Francisco is west of Boston. Therefore, Boston University is east of UCSF.\
      \ So the answer is NO.\n</think>NO  \nBoston University in Massachusetts (longitude\
      \ \u2248 -71.1\xB0) is located east of the University of California, San Francisco\
      \ (longitude \u2248 -122.5\xB0). Since lower (more negative) longitude values\

      First, I should find the longitude of Boston University. Boston is in Massachusetts,\

      \ Longitude is measured from 0\xB0 at the prime meridian (Greenwich, UK) going\
      \ east to 180\xB0 (east longitude) and west to -180\xB0 (west longitude). So,\

      \ coast including California, Oregon, Washington. So, Boston University is in\
      \ Boston, MA, which is definitely on the east coast. University of California,\
      \ San Francisco (UCSF) is in San Francisco, CA, which is on the west coast.\n\
      \nNow, the question is about which is further west. Generally, the west coast\
      \ is west of the east coast. But longitude coordinates are key here. Places\
      \ with higher longitude (more west) have a higher west longitude value, but\
      \ when considering east vs. west, the west coast has a more westerly longitude\
      \ than the east coast. Wait, longitude is measured from the prime meridian (0\xB0\
      ) going east and west up to 180\xB0. So, in the US, the east coast has negative\
      \ longitude values (since they're west of the prime meridian but in the western\
      \ hemisphere). For example, Boston's longitude is around -71 degrees, and San\
      \ Francisco is around -122 degrees. Wait, but when comparing westness, the more\
      \ negative the longitude (i.e., the smaller the number when considering west\
      \ as negative), the further west a location is. So, -122 is further west than\
      \ -71. Therefore, San Francisco is west of Boston. So Boston University is east\
      \ of UCSF, so the answer should be NO. But let me verify the actual coordinates.\n\
      \nLooking up Boston University's coordinates: Boston, MA is approximately 42.35\xB0\
      \ N latitude, -71.05\xB0 W longitude. University of California, San Francisco's\
      \ coordinates: San Francisco, CA is approximately 37.77\xB0 N, -122.42\xB0 W.\
      \ Comparing the longitudes: -71.05 (BU) vs. -122.42 (UCSF). Since -122.42 is\
      \ more negative (further west), UCSF is west of BU. Therefore, Boston University\
      \ is east of UCSF. So the answer is NO.\n</think>NO  \nBoston University in\
      \ Massachusetts (longitude \u2248 -71.05\xB0) is located east of the University\

      \ inland. Wait, maybe not. Let me check mentally. The state of Michigan is located\
      \ in the Great Lakes region. Ann Arbor is in the southern part of Michigan's\
      \ Lower Peninsula. North Carolina is south of Virginia, on the East Coast. So,\
      \ is Michigan west of North Carolina? Maybe not. Wait, let me think about the\

      \ but in terms of decimal degrees with the negative sign, Ann Arbor would be\

      \ be more west. Wait, no, if you think of New York (around -74\xB0) and Los\
      \ Angeles (around -118\xB0), LA is further west, so it has a lower (more negative)\
      \ longitude. So lower longitude (more negative) means further west.\n\nSo to\

      \ The University of Michigan's main campus is there. The approximate longitude\
      \ for Ann Arbor is around -83.7\xB0W. Wait, but wait, -83.7 is more negative\

      \ Michigan at -83.7, then Duke is east of Michigan, meaning Michigan is west\
      \ of Duke. Therefore, the answer would be NO, Duke is not west of University\
      \ of Michigan's College of Engineering.\n\nWait, but I should double-check the\
      \ exact coordinates. Let me confirm:\n\nDuke University's coordinates: According\

      Let me start by recalling where these universities are. Duke University is in\
      \ Durham, North Carolina. The University of Michigan's College of Engineering\
      \ is part of the main campus in Ann Arbor, Michigan. So, I need to compare the\
      \ longitudes of Durham, NC, and Ann Arbor, MI. Since the question is about being\
      \ west, longitude is the key here. The further west a location is, the higher\
      \ its longitude value (in the western hemisphere, longitude is measured as negative\
      \ degrees west of the prime meridian). Wait, no, actually, in the US, which\
      \ is west of the prime meridian, the longitude is negative. So, a more western\
      \ location would have a more negative longitude. Wait, no, that's not right.\
      \ Let me clarify.\n\nLongitude lines run from the prime meridian (0 degrees)\
      \ eastward to 180 degrees and westward to -180 degrees. For locations in the\
      \ United States, which are west of the prime meridian, their longitudes are\
      \ negative. So, for example, New York City is around -74 degrees, and Los Angeles\

      \ Durham, NC. North Carolina is on the East Coast, so I expect its longitude\
      \ to be less negative (i.e., more east) than Michigan. For example, Raleigh,\
      \ NC is around 78.6\xB0 W, which is -78.6. Durham is near Raleigh, so maybe\
      \ around -78.9 or so. If that's the case, then Durham's longitude is -78.9,\

    d71b2dc3-2df1-41a7-bd53-a2636524e198: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Duke University in North Carolina is located west of the University of Michigan\
      \ College of Engineering in Michigan. Let's start by recalling where these two\
      \ places are. \n\nFirst, Duke University is in North Carolina. I know that North\
      \ Carolina is on the East Coast of the United States. The main city there for\
      \ Duke is Durham, NC. On the other hand, the University of Michigan's College\
      \ of Engineering is in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Michigan is a state in the Midwest,\
      \ near the Great Lakes, specifically Lake Erie and Lake Michigan. \n\nNow, the\
      \ key point is comparing their longitude because east and west directions are\
      \ determined by longitude. The further west a location is, the higher its longitude\
      \ value (in the Western Hemisphere, since west longitudes are negative but when\
      \ considering absolute degrees, higher numerical value means further west).\
      \ \n\nWait, actually, longitude is measured from the prime meridian (0\xB0),\
      \ with locations west of it having negative values (in the Western Hemisphere),\
      \ and east being positive. But when comparing east vs. west in the US, since\
      \ all of the US is west of the prime meridian, their longitudes are negative\
      \ numbers. So, the more westward a place is, the more negative (i.e., smaller\
      \ in numerical value when considering the negative sign) its longitude. Wait,\
      \ no, hold on. Let me make sure. For example, New York City is around -74\xB0\
      \ longitude, and Los Angeles is around -118\xB0. So LA is further west, which\
      \ has a more negative longitude. So when comparing two negative numbers, the\
      \ one with the smaller number (more negative) is further west. Therefore, to\
      \ determine which is west, the one with the smaller (more negative) longitude\
      \ is further west.\n\nSo I need to find the longitude coordinates for both Duke\
      \ University and the University of Michigan College of Engineering. \n\nLet's\
      \ start with Duke University in Durham, NC. I think Durham's coordinates are\
      \ approximately 35.9940\xB0 N, 78.8986\xB0 W. So the longitude is -78.8986.\n\
      \nNext, the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Ann Arbor, MI's coordinates\
      \ are roughly 42.2780\xB0 N, 83.7382\xB0 W. So the longitude here is -83.7382.\n\
      \nNow comparing the two longitudes: Duke is at -78.8986, and Michigan is at\
      \ -83.7382. Since -78.8986 is less negative (closer to zero) than -83.7382,\
      \ that means Duke is further east. Conversely, Michigan's longitude is more\
      \ negative, so it's further west. Therefore, Duke University in NC is east of\
      \ the University of Michigan in MI.\n\nWait, the question is asking if Duke\
      \ is west of Michigan. Since Michigan's longitude is more west (more negative),\
      \ Duke's is less west. Therefore, Duke is east of Michigan. So the answer would\
      \ be NO, Duke is not west of University of Michigan College of Engineering;\
      \ it's east.\n</think>To determine if Duke University, NC is west of the University\
      \ of Michigan College of Engineering, MI, compare their longitudes:  \n- **Duke\
      \ University (Durham, NC):** Longitude \u2248 -78.8986\xB0 (less negative, further\
      \ east).  \n- **University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI):** Longitude \u2248 -83.7382\xB0\
      \ (more negative, further west).  \n\nSince **-78.8986\xB0 is east of -83.7382\xB0\
      **, Duke is **not** west of Michigan.  \n\n**Answer:** NO"
    e9af944d-b8a0-4134-950b-185d4dbe2628: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\

      \ \n\nFirst, I should recall where these universities are. Duke University is\
      \ in Durham, North Carolina. The University of Michigan's College of Engineering\
      \ is part of the main campus in Ann Arbor, Michigan. \n\nNow, I need to find\
      \ the longitude coordinates for both cities. I remember that the prime meridian\
      \ is 0\xB0, and locations to the west have negative longitudes in the Western\
      \ Hemisphere. The US is in the west, so longitudes are negative when using the\
      \ common format. Wait, actually, in the US, longitudes are west of the prime\
      \ meridian, so they are typically expressed as negative numbers if we're using\
      \ the standard where east is positive and west is negative. For example, New\
      \ York is around -74 degrees, Los Angeles around -118.\n\nSo, Durham, NC: I\

      \ might be around -83.7 degrees. \n\nWait, if Durham is at -78.9 and Ann Arbor\
      \ is at -83.7, then comparing the two: since longitude west is more negative,\
      \ the more negative the value, the further west. So -83.7 is west of -78.9.\
      \ So that would mean Ann Arbor is west of Durham. Therefore, Duke (Durham) is\

      \ Michigan's College of Engineering. The answer would be no. \n\nBut wait, let\
      \ me confirm the exact longitudes. Maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me think.\
      \ For example, Durham, NC: a quick search in my mind, I recall that Raleigh,\
      \ NC is around -78.6, and Durham is nearby, so maybe similar. Ann Arbor, MI:\
      \ I think Detroit is around -83.0, and Ann Arbor is west of Detroit, so maybe\
      \ around -83.7 or so. So yes, Ann Arbor is at a more western longitude than\
      \ Durham. Therefore, Duke is east of UMich Engineering. So the answer is NO.\n\

      \ **-83.7\xB0 (Michigan)** is further west than **-78.9\xB0 (Duke)**, Duke is\
      \ **east** of Michigan's College of Engineering.  \n\nANSWER: NO"
    faaf1cbe-ead4-4401-9b0f-6896da07aea3: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The user wants to know if Duke University in North Carolina\
      \ is located west of the University of Michigan College of Engineering in Michigan.\
      \ The answer needs to be a straightforward YES or NO, but I need to reason through\
      \ it first.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to figure out the locations of both universities.\
      \ Let me start with Duke University. I know that Duke is in Durham, North Carolina.\
      \ Now, the University of Michigan's College of Engineering... I believe the\
      \ main campus of the University of Michigan is in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I think\
      \ the College of Engineering is part of the main campus, right? So, Ann Arbor,\
      \ MI.\n\nNext step: determine the longitude of both cities. Since the question\
      \ is about east-west positioning, longitude is the key here. The further west\
      \ a location is, the higher its longitude value (in the Western Hemisphere),\
      \ right? Wait, no, actually longitude in the Western Hemisphere is measured\
      \ in degrees west of the Prime Meridian. But when we talk about coordinates,\
      \ west longitudes are typically expressed as negative numbers. So higher numerical\
      \ values (closer to zero) would be more east, and lower (more negative) would\
      \ be more west. Wait, no, I might be getting this mixed up. Let me clarify.\n\
      \nLongitude lines run from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0) to the west and east,\
      \ up to 180\xB0E and 180\xB0W. However, in terms of coordinates, locations in\
      \ the western hemisphere (like the US) have longitudes that are negative when\
      \ using the decimal system. For example, New York might be around -74\xB0W,\
      \ and Los Angeles around -118\xB0W. So, the more negative the longitude, the\
      \ further west the location is. Therefore, when comparing two longitudes, the\
      \ one with the smaller numerical value (more negative) is further west.\n\n\
      So, if Duke University in Durham, NC has a longitude that's more west (more\
      \ negative) than the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI, then the answer\
      \ would be YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nNow, I need to find the exact longitudes.\
      \ Let me recall or think if I know approximate longitudes for these cities.\
      \ Alternatively, I can use some geographical knowledge.\n\nAnn Arbor, Michigan:\
      \ I know that Michigan is in the Eastern Time Zone, which is UTC-5. Generally,\
      \ the Eastern Time Zone in the US covers from around 75\xB0W (like New York)\
      \ to about 85\xB0W (like parts of Michigan). Wait, but I think Ann Arbor is\
      \ in the Eastern Time Zone. Let's check approximate longitude. Detroit, Michigan\
      \ is around 83\xB0W. Ann Arbor is west of Detroit, so maybe around 83.7\xB0\
      W or so. Let me confirm: looking up from memory, Ann Arbor's coordinates are\
      \ approximately 42.28\xB0N latitude, -83.74\xB0W longitude.\n\nDuke University\
      \ in Durham, NC. North Carolina is further south, but longitude-wise, it's also\
      \ in the Eastern Time Zone. Cities like Raleigh, NC are around 78\xB0W. Durham\
      \ is near Raleigh. Let me check: Durham, NC coordinates are approximately 35.99\xB0\
      N, -78.90\xB0W.\n\nWait, but wait. If Ann Arbor is at about -83.74\xB0W and\
      \ Durham is at -78.90\xB0W, then comparing the longitudes: -83.74 is more west\
      \ than -78.90 because -83.74 is smaller (more negative). So, Ann Arbor is west\
      \ of Durham. Therefore, Durham, NC (Duke) is east of Ann Arbor, MI (UMich Engineering).\
      \ Therefore, Duke is east, not west. Therefore, the answer would be NO.\n\n\
      Wait, but wait\u2014hold on. Let me verify again. If a location has a longitude\
      \ of -83.74\xB0 (Ann Arbor) and another has -78.90\xB0 (Durham), then Ann Arbor\
      \ is further west because -83.74 is less than -78.90. So, Duke is at -78.9,\
      \ which is east of Ann Arbor's -83.74. Therefore, the University of Michigan\
      \ College of Engineering is west of Duke University, so Duke is not west of\
      \ UMich\u2014it's east. Hence, the answer is NO.\n</think>NO  \n**Step 1:**\

      \  \nUniversity of Michigan College of Engineering is in Ann Arbor, MI (~-83.74\xB0\

      \ longitude indicates a farther west location.  \n-83.74\xB0 (Ann Arbor) < -78.90\xB0\
      \ (Durham).  \n\n**Conclusion:** Ann Arbor (MI) is west of Durham (NC), so Duke\

      Wait, longitude is measured in degrees west of the Prime Meridian. So cities\

      \ Pennsylvania is south of New York, and Massachusetts is north of New York.\
      \ But longitude-wise, which city is more to the west? Let me visualize a map.\
      \ If you look at the East Coast, cities like Boston, New York, Philadelphia,\
      \ and Washington D.C. run from north to south. New York City is south of Boston\
      \ but north of Philadelphia. So Philadelphia is south of New York, which is\
      \ south of Boston. But longitude is about east-west, not north-south. \n\nWait,\
      \ longitude lines run north to south, so places with a higher longitude (more\
      \ west) are further west. Wait, no, longitude is measured from the prime meridian.\
      \ In the US, all longitudes are west, so they are negative numbers. For example,\
      \ Boston's longitude is around -71 degrees, and Philadelphia is around -75 degrees.\
      \ Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I have that backwards. Let me check\
      \ my memory. \n\nActually, cities on the East Coast have longitudes that are\
      \ west of the prime meridian, so they are negative in decimal degrees. For example,\
      \ New York City is around -74 degrees longitude. Boston is a bit more east,\
      \ so maybe around -71 degrees. Philadelphia, being south of NYC, might be around\
      \ -75 degrees. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because moving west would increase\
      \ the longitude in the negative direction. Wait, no, longitude decreases as\
      \ you go east. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the more east you\
      \ go, the lower the longitude (since it's measured from 0 at the prime meridian\
      \ going east to 180, but in the western hemisphere, it's negative). So, for\

      \ the eastern part of Massachusetts, which juts out into the Atlantic. Philadelphia,\

      \ But how much? Let me visualize a map. If you look at the East Coast, Boston\

      \ New York City is around -74 degrees, while Boston is around -71 degrees. So\
      \ Boston is at around 71\xB0W, and Philadelphia is around 75\xB0W? Wait, that\
      \ can't be right. Wait, no, let me correct that. \n\nWait, New York City's longitude\
      \ is approximately 74\xB0W. Boston is actually a bit east of NYC, so maybe around\
      \ 71\xB0W. Philadelphia is southwest of NYC, so its longitude would be around\
      \ 75\xB0W. Wait, but longitude west becomes more negative as you go west. So\
      \ if Boston is at -71\xB0 and Philadelphia is at -75\xB0, then Philadelphia\
      \ is further west because -75 is more west than -71. So that would mean Philadelphia\

      \ another major city, also on the east coast. \n\nNow, I need to compare their\
      \ longitudinal positions to determine which is further west. Longitude measures\
      \ how far east or west a location is. The lower the longitude (more negative\
      \ in the Western Hemisphere), the further west it is. \n\nLet me check the approximate\
      \ longitudes. Boston's longitude is around -71.06 degrees. Philadelphia's longitude\
      \ is approximately -75.19 degrees. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait,\
      \ maybe I have them mixed up. Let me verify.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\
      \ Actually, cities on the east coast of the US have longitudes that are west\
      \ (negative) relative to the Prime Meridian. Boston is north and east compared\
      \ to Philadelphia. Wait, but longitude-wise, Philadelphia is actually further\
      \ south and perhaps a bit west? Let me get the exact coordinates.\n\nNortheastern\
      \ University in Boston, MA: According to a quick search, the coordinates are\
      \ approximately 42.3398\xB0 N, -71.0892\xB0 W. \n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\
      \ in Philadelphia, PA: Their coordinates are around 39.9522\xB0 N, -75.1932\xB0\
      \ W. \n\nSo comparing the longitudes: Northeastern is at -71.0892, and UPenn\
      \ is at -75.1932. Since longitude lines decrease as you go west, a more negative\
      \ number means further west. So UPenn's longitude is more negative than Northeastern's.\
      \ That means UPenn is actually further west than Northeastern.\n\nWait, but\
      \ wait, Boston is in the eastern part of Massachusetts, and Philadelphia is\
      \ in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania. But according to the coordinates,\
      \ UPenn's longitude is -75.19, which is further west (since -75 is more west\
      \ than -71). Therefore, Northeastern University in Boston is actually east of\
      \ UPenn. So the answer would be NO, Northeastern is not west of UPenn; it's\
      \ east.\n</think>Northeastern University in Boston, MA has a longitude of approximately\
      \ -71.09\xB0 W, while the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA is\
      \ at about -75.19\xB0 W. Since lower (more negative) longitude indicates a location\
      \ further west, UPenn is west of Northeastern. Therefore, Northeastern is **east**\
      \ of UPenn.\n\nNO."
    ffd77189-1ec0-4611-9b5f-92616bd00fd3: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Northeastern University in Massachusetts is located west of the University\
      \ of Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania. Hmm, I need to figure out the geographic\
      \ locations of both universities and compare their longitudes. \n\nFirst, I\
      \ should recall where each university is. Northeastern University is in Boston,\
      \ MA. The University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) is in Philadelphia, PA. So the\
      \ question is essentially asking if Boston is west of Philadelphia.\n\nWait,\
      \ I know that Boston is on the east coast of the US. Philadelphia is also on\
      \ the east coast but further south. But in terms of east-west positioning, which\
      \ one is more to the west? Let me think about the general geography. Boston\
      \ is in the northeastern part of Massachusetts, which is part of New England.\
      \ Philadelphia is in southeastern Pennsylvania. \n\nI remember that cities along\
      \ the east coast have different longitudes. The further north you go on the\
      \ east coast, the more eastward you might be? Or is it the other way around?\
      \ Wait, longitude lines run north-south, so east-west position is determined\
      \ by longitude. A lower longitude (more negative) would be further west. Since\
      \ the US is in the western hemisphere, longitudes are negative. For example,\
      \ Boston's longitude is around -71.05 degrees, and Philadelphia is around -75.16\
      \ degrees. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I have that backwards.\
      \ Let me check my memory. \n\nWait, actually, cities on the east coast have\
      \ more negative longitudes because they are west of the prime meridian. But\
      \ when comparing two cities in the US, the one further west would have a less\
      \ negative (higher) longitude. For example, New York City is around -74.0, and\
      \ Chicago is around -87.6, but wait, that's not right. Wait, no, longitude for\
      \ New York is approximately -74.0060, and Chicago is around -87.6298. So Chicago\
      \ is further west, so its longitude is more negative. So higher negative numbers\
      \ mean further west. So if Boston has a longitude of, say, -71.05, and Philadelphia\
      \ is at -75.16, then Philadelphia would actually be further west because -75.16\
      \ is more negative than -71.05. Wait, that can't be right because Philadelphia\
      \ is south of New York, which is around -74. So maybe I'm mixing up the numbers.\
      \ Let me think again.\n\nWait, let's get specific. Let me recall the approximate\
      \ longitudes. Boston, MA: approximately 42.36\xB0 N latitude, -71.06\xB0 W longitude.\
      \ Philadelphia, PA: approximately 39.95\xB0 N latitude, -75.16\xB0 W longitude.\
      \ So Boston's longitude is -71.06, Philadelphia's is -75.16. Since longitude\
      \ measures east-west, with more negative values being further west. So -75.16\
      \ is more west than -71.06. Therefore, Philadelphia is west of Boston. Wait,\
      \ that would mean that Boston is east of Philadelphia. So Northeastern University\
      \ (Boston) is east of UPenn (Philadelphia). Therefore, the answer would be NO,\
      \ Northeastern is not west of UPenn; it's east of it.\n\nBut wait, I need to\
      \ confirm. Let me think of another way. If you look at a map of the US east\
      \ coast, Boston is in the far northeast, while Philadelphia is south of New\
      \ York City. New York City is around -74.0 longitude, so Philadelphia at -75.16\
      \ is west of NYC. Boston is at -71.06, which is east of NYC. So Boston is east\
      \ of Philadelphia. Therefore, Northeastern is east of UPenn, so the answer is\
      \ NO.\n</think>To determine if Northeastern University, MA is west of the University\
      \ of Pennsylvania, PA:  \n1. **Locations**: Northeastern is in Boston, MA (longitude\
      \ \u2248 -71.06\xB0), and UPenn is in Philadelphia, PA (longitude \u2248 -75.16\xB0\

      \ Johns Hopkins University in Maryland is west of Stanford University in California.\
      \ Hmm, let's start by recalling where these two universities are located. \n\
      \nFirst, Johns Hopkins University\u2014I know it's in Maryland, but where exactly?\
      \ I think the main campus is in Baltimore. But I should confirm that. Then Stanford\
      \ University is in California, specifically in Stanford, which is near Palo\
      \ Alto, right? That's in the northern part of California, near San Francisco\
      \ Bay Area. \n\nNow, to determine which is further west, I need to compare their\
      \ longitudes. The place with the more western longitude (more negative if we're\
      \ using the standard -180 to +180 system) would be further west. So, what's\
      \ the longitude of Baltimore, Maryland versus Stanford, California?\n\nLet me\
      \ try to recall. The west coast of the US is obviously further west than the\
      \ east coast. Maryland is on the east coast, so Baltimore should be around 76\
      \ degrees west longitude. San Francisco is around 122 degrees west. Wait, no,\
      \ San Francisco is approximately 122\xB0W, so Stanford, being nearby, would\
      \ also be around there. But Johns Hopkins in Baltimore would be about 76\xB0\
      W. Since longitude increases as you go west (from the prime meridian at 0\xB0\
      ), the higher the number in the west direction, the further west it is. So 122\xB0\
      W is much further west than 76\xB0W. Therefore, Stanford would be west of Johns\
      \ Hopkins. But the question is asking if Johns Hopkins is west of Stanford,\
      \ which is the opposite. So the answer would be no. \n\nWait, maybe I should\
      \ check the exact coordinates to be sure. Let me think: Baltimore, MD's longitude\
      \ is approximately -76.61, and Stanford, CA is around -122.16. Comparing those,\
      \ -122.16 is more west because it's a larger negative number. So Stanford is\
      \ further west. Therefore, Johns Hopkins (Baltimore) is east of Stanford. Hence,\
      \ the answer is NO.\n</think>To determine if Johns Hopkins University (MD) is\
      \ west of Stanford University (CA):  \n1. **Locations**: Johns Hopkins' main\
      \ campus is in Baltimore, MD (east coast). Stanford is in Stanford, CA (west\
      \ coast).  \n2. **Longitudes**: Baltimore is approximately **-76.61\xB0**, while\
      \ Stanford is **-122.16\xB0**.  \n3. **Comparison**: A more negative longitude\
      \ indicates a location further west. Since **-122.16\xB0** (Stanford) is farther\

      \ in decimal. Stanford is a bit south of SF but similar longitude.\n\nComparing\
      \ the two: Johns Hopkins is around -76.6, Stanford is around -122.4. Wait, but\
      \ longitude goes from 0 at Greenwich, with west being negative. So the more\

      \ Johns Hopkins University is in Baltimore, Maryland. Stanford University is\
      \ in Stanford, California, which is near Palo Alto, right? So, California is\
      \ definitely on the western side of the US, and Maryland is on the eastern side.\
      \ But wait, the question is about which one is further west. Even though Maryland\
      \ is east, maybe there's a part of it that's further west than Stanford? That\
      \ seems unlikely, but let me think about the longitudes.\n\nLongitude is the\
      \ key here. Places with higher west longitude (more negative if using the prime\
      \ meridian as 0) are further west. Wait, in the US, longitude is measured west\
      \ of the prime meridian, so for example, California would have a longitude around\
      \ 120\xB0W to 125\xB0W, while Maryland is around 75\xB0W to 79\xB0W. So Stanford,\
      \ CA is around 122\xB0W longitude, and Johns Hopkins in Baltimore is about 76.6\xB0\
      W. Since 76.6\xB0W is east (closer to 0) compared to 122\xB0W, that means Johns\
      \ Hopkins is east of Stanford. Therefore, Stanford is further west. So the answer\
      \ would be NO, Johns Hopkins is not west of Stanford. It's actually east of\
      \ Stanford.\n</think>To determine if Johns Hopkins University (MD) is west of\
      \ Stanford University (CA):  \n1. **Locations**: Johns Hopkins is in Baltimore,\
      \ MD (longitude ~76.6\xB0W). Stanford is in California (longitude ~122.1\xB0\
      W).  \n2. **Longitude Comparison**: A higher numerical value (more west of the\
      \ prime meridian) indicates a western location.  \n3. **Conclusion**: 76.6\xB0\
      W (Johns Hopkins) is east of 122.1\xB0W (Stanford).  \n\nANSWER: NO"
    a5ecc375-f196-4886-8759-fe8a01a4db81: "<think>Alright, let me figure this out.\
      \ The question is whether Johns Hopkins University in Maryland is located west\
      \ of Stanford University in California. At first glance, that seems counterintuitive\
      \ because California is on the West Coast, and Maryland is on the East Coast.\
      \ But maybe there's a trick here, like a branch campus or something. Let me\
      \ start by recalling where each university is located.\n\nJohns Hopkins University's\
      \ main campus is in Baltimore, Maryland. I know Maryland is on the East Coast,\
      \ near Washington D.C. Stanford University is in Stanford, California, which\
      \ is in the northern part of California, near San Francisco. So, looking at\
      \ a map of the US, the West Coast includes California, Oregon, and Washington\
      \ states. The East Coast includes states like New York, Maryland, Virginia,\
      \ etc.\n\nNow, longitude is the key here. Places with higher longitude (more\
      \ to the east) are further east, and lower longitude (more to the west) are\
      \ further west. Wait, no. Actually, longitude is measured from the Prime Meridian\
      \ in Greenwich, England. So, in the US, all longitudes are west of the Prime\
      \ Meridian, meaning they have negative values if we're using the standard coordinate\
      \ system where east is positive and west is negative. But when comparing two\
      \ places in the US, the one with the more negative (lower) longitude is further\
      \ west. Alternatively, if we consider absolute values, the higher the longitude\
      \ value west, the further west it is. For example, California has a higher longitude\
      \ west than Maryland, so it's further west.\n\nWait, maybe I should check approximate\
      \ longitudes. Let me think. Baltimore, MD. The approximate longitude for Baltimore\
      \ is around 76.6 degrees west. Stanford, CA is around 122.2 degrees west. Wait,\
      \ but longitude increases as you go west from the Prime Meridian. So 122\xB0\
      W is further west than 76\xB0W. So Stanford has a more western longitude than\
      \ Johns Hopkins. Therefore, Stanford is west of Johns Hopkins. Conversely, Johns\
      \ Hopkins in Maryland is east of Stanford. So the answer would be NO, Johns\
      \ Hopkins is not west of Stanford. It's actually east of Stanford.\n\nBut to\
      \ make sure I'm not mixing up east and west. If a place has a higher numerical\
      \ value in west longitude, it's further west. So, 122\xB0W is further west than\
      \ 76\xB0W. Therefore, Stanford (122\xB0W) is west of Johns Hopkins (76\xB0W).\
      \ So Johns Hopkins is east of Stanford, making the answer NO. \n\nWait, but\
      \ maybe I should verify the exact coordinates. Let me look up the exact longitudes\
      \ of both universities. \n\nJohns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD: According\
      \ to a quick search, the coordinates are approximately 39.3299\xB0 N, 76.6205\xB0\
      \ W. \n\nStanford University in Stanford, CA: Approximately 37.4275\xB0 N, 122.1697\xB0\
      \ W. \n\nComparing the longitudes: 76.6205\xB0 W vs. 122.1697\xB0 W. The higher\
      \ the number in the west, the further west the location. So 122.1697\xB0 W is\
      \ further west than 76.6205\xB0 W. Therefore, Stanford is west of Johns Hopkins.\
      \ So Johns Hopkins is east of Stanford. Therefore, the answer is NO, Johns Hopkins\
      \ University, MD is not located west of Stanford University, CA.\n</think>NO\
      \  \nJohns Hopkins University in Maryland (longitude ~76.6\xB0W) is east of\
      \ Stanford University in California (longitude ~122.2\xB0W). Since lower longitudes\
      \ (less westward) are further east, Johns Hopkins is not west of Stanford."
    af387237-51be-47da-a5ce-7c91e5a89c52: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure out whether\
      \ Johns Hopkins University in Maryland is west of Stanford University in California.\
      \ Hmm, first, I need to recall the locations of both universities. \n\nJohns\
      \ Hopkins is in Maryland, right? Maryland is on the East Coast of the United\
      \ States. I remember cities like Baltimore and Annapolis are there. Stanford\
      \ is in California, which is on the West Coast. So intuitively, since the East\
      \ Coast is the Atlantic side and the West Coast is the Pacific, Maryland should\
      \ be east of California. But maybe I need to check the exact longitudes to be\
      \ sure.\n\nLongitude measures east-west position. Places with a higher longitude\
      \ (more west) are further west. Wait, no, longitude goes from 0\xB0 at the Prime\
      \ Meridian (Greenwich, UK) and increases to the east and west up to 180\xB0\
      . But when comparing in the US, since all of the contiguous states are in the\
      \ western hemisphere, their longitudes are west of the Prime Meridian, so they\
      \ have negative values if we use the -180 to +180 system. For example, the East\
      \ Coast cities like New York have a longitude around -74\xB0, while West Coast\
      \ cities like Los Angeles are around -118\xB0. The more negative the longitude,\
      \ the further west it is. Wait, no, actually, in terms of west longitude, higher\
      \ numerical values (more negative) are further west. Wait, maybe I'm getting\
      \ confused here. Let me think again.\n\nLongitude lines run from the North Pole\
      \ to the South Pole. The Prime Meridian is 0\xB0, and as you go west, the longitude\
      \ increases up to 180\xB0W, and east up to 180\xB0E. But in the US, all longitudes\
      \ are west of the Prime Meridian, so they're in the western hemisphere, which\
      \ means the longitude is given as degrees west, but in the decimal system, that's\
      \ represented as negative numbers. For example, New York City is approximately\
      \ 40.7\xB0N latitude, 74.0\xB0W longitude. Los Angeles is about 34.05\xB0N,\
      \ 118.25\xB0W. So the longitude for LA is more negative (118.25\xB0W) than NYC's\
      \ 74\xB0W. So even though 118 is a higher number than 74, because it's more\
      \ negative, it's actually further west. \n\nSo if I compare the longitudes of\
      \ Johns Hopkins and Stanford, the one with the more western longitude (more\
      \ negative) is further west. \n\nJohns Hopkins University is in Baltimore, Maryland.\
      \ Let me check the coordinates. Baltimore's coordinates are approximately 39.29\xB0\
      N, 76.61\xB0W. Stanford University is in Stanford, California, near Palo Alto.\
      \ The coordinates for Stanford are approximately 37.43\xB0N, 122.17\xB0W. \n\
      \nNow comparing the longitudes: Johns Hopkins is at -76.61\xB0, Stanford at\
      \ -122.17\xB0. Since -122.17 is more negative (or a larger number when considering\
      \ absolute values west), that means Stanford is further west. Therefore, Johns\
      \ Hopkins is east of Stanford. So the question is, is Johns Hopkins west of\
      \ Stanford? The answer should be NO, because Stanford is further west.\n</think>To\
      \ determine if Johns Hopkins University (JHU) in Maryland is west of Stanford\

      \ MD):** Approximately 76.61\xB0W longitude.\n- **Stanford (CA):** Approximately\
      \ 122.17\xB0W longitude.\n\nSince **lower** longitude values (less negative)\

      \ \n\n**Answer:** NO."

      \ a longitude comparison here. Let me think about the specific longitudes of\
      \ each university's location.\n\nLongitude measures how far east or west a location\
      \ is. The Prime Meridian is 0\xB0, and in the US, longitudes are west of the\
      \ Prime Meridian, so they're negative numbers. The more negative the longitude,\
      \ the further west it is. Wait, no, actually, in the US, longitudes are west\
      \ of the Prime Meridian, so they are measured as degrees west, which would mean\
      \ they have positive values in some systems, but in standard decimal notation,\
      \ they're negative. For example, California would have a longitude around -122\xB0\
      , while Maryland might be around -76\xB0. \n\nSo, if Johns Hopkins is in Maryland,\

      \ N, 122.1697\xB0 W. Comparing the longitudes: -76.6122 (Johns Hopkins) vs.\
      \ -122.1697 (Stanford). Wait, since longitude becomes more negative as you go\
      \ west, Stanford has a more negative longitude. Therefore, Stanford is further\

      \  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Locate the Universities:** Johns\

    064937df-cfcb-4311-aea2-82252dad89eb: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The question is asking whether Harvard Summer School in Massachusetts\
      \ is located west of Arizona State University in Arizona. Hmm, I need to figure\
      \ out the geographical locations of both universities and then determine their\
      \ relative east-west positions.\n\nFirst, I'll start by recalling where each\
      \ university is located. Harvard University is in Cambridge, Massachusetts,\
      \ right? Cambridge is part of the Boston metropolitan area. So the Harvard Summer\
      \ School would be in the same location as the main campus, I assume. So that's\
      \ in the northeastern United States, on the east coast.\n\nArizona State University\
      \ (ASU) is in Arizona. Arizona is in the southwestern part of the US. The main\
      \ campus for ASU is in Tempe, Arizona. Tempe is near Phoenix, which is the capital\
      \ of Arizona. So ASU is in the southwest, while Harvard is in the northeast.\n\
      \nNow, the key is to determine their longitudinal positions because longitude\
      \ determines east-west placement. The further west a location is, the higher\
      \ its longitude value (in the Western Hemisphere, since west longitudes are\
      \ negative when expressed in decimal degrees). Wait, no, actually, longitude\
      \ for the US would be west of the Prime Meridian, so values are negative. For\
      \ example, Boston is around -71 degrees longitude, and Phoenix is around -112\
      \ degrees. Wait, but longitude decreases as you go east. Wait, let me make sure.\
      \ The Prime Meridian is 0 degrees, and as you go west, the longitude becomes\
      \ more negative (or up to -180). So Boston, being on the east coast, has a longitude\
      \ of approximately -71 degrees. Phoenix, Arizona, is further west, so its longitude\
      \ is around -112 degrees. \n\nWait, but longitude west is measured as negative\
      \ values, so a more negative number means further west. So if Harvard is at\
      \ around -71\xB0 and ASU is at -112\xB0, then ASU is further west because -112\
      \ is less than -71 (since it's more negative). Therefore, Harvard (Massachusetts)\
      \ is east of Arizona State (Arizona). So the question is asking if Harvard is\
      \ west of ASU. The answer would be no, because ASU is actually west of Harvard.\
      \ \n\nSo putting it all together: Harvard is in the eastern part of the US,\
      \ ASU is in the southwest. Since west is towards the left on a map, Arizona\
      \ is to the west of Massachusetts. Therefore, Harvard is east of ASU. So the\
      \ statement \"Is Harvard Summer School, MA located west of Arizona State University,\
      \ AZ?\" is false. The answer is NO.\n</think>NO  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\
      \  \n1. **Locations:** Harvard Summer School is in Cambridge, MA (northeastern\

      \ US).  \n2. **Longitudes:** Cambridge, MA, is approximately **-71.06\xB0 W**,\
      \ while Tempe, AZ, is approximately **-111.94\xB0 W**.  \n3. **Comparison:**\
      \ A more negative longitude indicates a position further west. Since -111.94\xB0\
      \ (ASU) is more negative than -71.06\xB0 (Harvard), ASU is west of Harvard.\
      \ Thus, Harvard is **east** of ASU.  \n\n**Answer:** NO"
    228e1dc3-85f6-40a4-81f4-3ea5a1ef27c3: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\

      \ of both places. \n\nHarvard Summer School is part of Harvard University, right?\
      \ And Harvard is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. So Cambridge, MA is in the northeastern\
      \ part of the US. Arizona State University is in Arizona, which is in the southwestern\
      \ part. Now, I need to compare their longitudes because west means a more western\
      \ longitude (which is a lower number in the western hemisphere). \n\nWait, longitude\
      \ coordinates: the US uses degrees west of the prime meridian. So places further\
      \ west have higher longitude values if we're talking about west longitude, but\
      \ actually, in the US, longitude is measured as west of the prime meridian,\
      \ so the numbers increase as you go west. Wait, no, longitude is measured from\
      \ 0\xB0 at the prime meridian (Greenwich) going east to 180\xB0 and west to\
      \ -180\xB0, but typically in the US, it's referred to as degrees west, so for\
      \ example, New York might be around 74\xB0W, and Los Angeles around 118\xB0\
      W. Wait, but longitude for the US is in the western hemisphere, so it's negative\
      \ when using the format where east is positive. For example, Boston is approximately\
      \ -71.05\xB0 longitude, and Phoenix, Arizona is around -112.07\xB0. So the more\
      \ negative the longitude, the further west it is. \n\nSo Harvard in Cambridge,\
      \ MA has a longitude of about -71.1\xB0, and Arizona State University in Tempe,\
      \ AZ is around -111.9\xB0. Comparing these, -111.9\xB0 is more west than -71.1\xB0\
      , right? Because the higher the negative number (the further from zero), the\
      \ more west it is. So Arizona State is west of Harvard. Therefore, Harvard is\
      \ east of Arizona State. So the question is asking if Harvard Summer School\
      \ is west of ASU. Since Harvard is east, the answer would be NO.\n\nWait, but\
      \ maybe I should double-check the exact coordinates. Let me confirm. Harvard\

      \ Arizona State University in Tempe is at about 33.4255\xB0 N, -111.9400\xB0\
      \ W. So yes, ASU's longitude is -111.94, which is more west (more negative)\
      \ than Harvard's -71.11. Therefore, ASU is west of Harvard. So Harvard is east\

      \ Arizona is in the southwest, near California and New Mexico. So the states\
      \ themselves: Arizona is definitely west of Massachusetts. But wait, the question\
      \ is about the specific universities. Let's confirm their locations.\n\nHarvard\
      \ Summer School is part of Harvard University, which is in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\
      \ Arizona State University is in Tempe, Arizona. Now, looking at the map, Massachusetts\
      \ is in the northeastern part of the US, while Arizona is in the southwestern\
      \ part. Longitude-wise, the further west a location is, the higher its longitude\
      \ value (assuming we're talking about the western hemisphere). Wait, no, longitude\
      \ for the US is measured in west longitude, so actually, the more west you go,\
      \ the higher the longitude number, but in the US, since it's west of the prime\
      \ meridian, longitude is negative. Wait, no, the prime meridian is 0\xB0, and\
      \ locations west of it have negative longitude values. So Massachusetts would\
      \ have a longitude around, say, -71 degrees (Cambridge, MA is approximately\
      \ -71.1). Arizona State in Tempe is around -111.9 degrees. Wait, no, wait, negative\
      \ longitude increases as you go west. Wait, actually, longitude west of the\
      \ prime meridian is measured as negative degrees. So a more western location\
      \ would have a more negative longitude. For example, Cambridge, MA is about\
      \ 71 degrees west, which is -71. Tempe, AZ is about 111 degrees west, which\
      \ would be -111.9. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, Tempe, AZ is actually\
      \ around 111 degrees west longitude? Let me double-check. Maybe I'm getting\
      \ confused. Let me think: The contiguous US spans from approximately 67 degrees\
      \ west (east coast, like Maine) to around 124 degrees west (west coast, like\
      \ Washington state). So Massachusetts is on the east, so around -70 to -73 longitude.\
      \ Arizona is further west, so maybe around -111 to -114. So Tempe, AZ's coordinates\
      \ are approximately 33.4255\xB0 N, 111.9400\xB0 W. So that's longitude -111.94.\
      \ Cambridge, MA is at approximately 42.3736\xB0 N, 71.1097\xB0 W. So longitude\
      \ -71.1097. \n\nNow, when comparing west-east positions, the more negative the\
      \ longitude, the further west it is. So since -111.94 (Arizona State) is more\
      \ negative than -71.1097 (Harvard), that means Arizona State is west of Harvard.\
      \ Therefore, Harvard is east of Arizona State. So the question is asking if\
      \ Harvard is west of Arizona State. Since Arizona State is further west, the\

      \ is in the Mountain Time Zone, so its longitude would be more westward, maybe\
      \ around -111 degrees? Wait, no\u2014Tempe, AZ, is in the Mountain Time Zone,\
      \ but what's the exact longitude? Let me verify.\n\nLooking up (though I can't\
      \ actually look it up, so I have to rely on memory), Boston, MA is approximately\
      \ 71\xB0W longitude, so -71. Tempe, AZ is around 111\xB0W? Wait, no\u2014wait,\
      \ the US ranges from about 67\xB0W in the east (Maine) to around 124\xB0W in\
      \ the west (Washington state). Arizona is in the southwest, so Tempe's longitude\
      \ should be around 112\xB0W. For example, Phoenix, which is near Tempe, is at\
      \ approximately 112\xB0W longitude. \n\nWait, but let me check my numbers. The\
      \ approximate longitude for Cambridge, MA is 71.11\xB0W (so -71.11), and Tempe,\
      \ AZ is 111.94\xB0W (so -111.94). Longitude values become more negative as you\
      \ go west. So, comparing the two: Cambridge is at -71.11, Tempe at -111.94.\
      \ Since -71.11 is greater (less negative) than -111.94, Cambridge is east of\
      \ Tempe. Therefore, Harvard Summer School (in Cambridge, MA) is east of Arizona\
      \ State University (Tempe, AZ). \n\nThe original question was whether Harvard\
      \ is west of ASU. Since Cambridge has a higher longitude (less west) than Tempe,\
      \ the answer is NO. Harvard is east of ASU, not west.\n</think>To determine\
      \ if Harvard Summer School, MA is west of Arizona State University, AZ:\n\n\
      1. **Locations**:  \n   - Harvard Summer School is in Cambridge, Massachusetts\
      \ (east coast).  \n   - Arizona State University is in Tempe, Arizona (southwest\
      \ US).  \n\n2. **Longitudes**:  \n   - Cambridge, MA: ~-71.1\xB0 (71.1\xB0W).\
      \  \n   - Tempe, AZ: ~-111.9\xB0 (111.9\xB0W).  \n\n3. **Comparison**:  \n \
      \  A more negative longitude (e.g., -111.9\xB0 for Tempe) is farther west. Since\
      \ -71.1\xB0 (Cambridge) is less negative than -111.9\xB0 (Tempe), **Cambridge\
      \ is east of Tempe**.\n\nANSWER: NO"
    4cdfaaa8-c672-4aeb-97fd-e6e1d0e5cd74: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user wants to know if Harvard Summer School in Massachusetts is located\
      \ west of Arizona State University in Arizona. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure\
      \ out the locations of both places.\n\nLet me start with Harvard. I know Harvard\
      \ University is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Summer School is part of Harvard,\
      \ so it's probably in the same area. Cambridge is near Boston, right? So, the\
      \ coordinates for Harvard would be around 42.3770\xB0 N, 71.1167\xB0 W. \n\n\
      Next, Arizona State University. Its main campus is in Tempe, Arizona. Let me\
      \ confirm the coordinates. Tempe's coordinates are approximately 33.4255\xB0\
      \ N, 111.9400\xB0 W. Wait, longitude is west, so a higher number means further\
      \ west. \n\nNow, comparing the longitudes: Harvard is at about 71.1167\xB0 W,\
      \ and Arizona State is at 111.9400\xB0 W. Since longitude increases as you go\
      \ west, a higher degree means further west. So, 111.94 is definitely west of\
      \ 71.1167. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, actually, if you're in the\
      \ western hemisphere, west longitude means it's west of the prime meridian.\
      \ So, a higher longitude value (more west) would be further west. So Arizona\
      \ State's longitude is 111.94\xB0 W, which is more west than Harvard's 71.1167\xB0\
      \ W. That means Arizona State is west of Harvard. Therefore, Harvard is east\
      \ of Arizona State. So the answer would be NO, Harvard Summer School is not\
      \ west of Arizona State; it's actually east of it.\n\nWait, let me make sure\
      \ I didn't mix up the directions. For longitude, lower values (e.g., 70s) are\
      \ further east in the US compared to higher values (like 110s). So yes, Arizona\
      \ State is in the west, Harvard is in the east. So Harvard is east of Arizona\
      \ State, so the question is asking if Harvard is west of ASU, which it's not.\
      \ Therefore, the answer is NO.\n</think>NO  \n**Explanation**:  \n1. **Harvard\
      \ Summer School** is in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with a longitude of approximately\
      \ 71.1\xB0 W.  \n2. **Arizona State University** is in Tempe, Arizona, with\
      \ a longitude of approximately 111.9\xB0 W.  \n3. Since lower longitude values\
      \ (e.g., 71\xB0 W) are farther **east** than higher values (e.g., 111\xB0 W),\
      \ Harvard (71.1\xB0 W) is east of Arizona State (111.9\xB0 W). Thus, Harvard\
      \ is **not** west of Arizona State."

      \ main campus is in Cambridge, MA. So the Summer School would be there too.\
      \ Arizona State University is in Arizona, probably in Tempe, which is part of\
      \ the Phoenix metropolitan area. \n\nNow, I need to compare their longitudes\
      \ because west means a more westward longitude (higher west longitude or lower\
      \ east longitude). Let me recall: the US is in the western hemisphere, so longitudes\
      \ are west of the prime meridian. So, the further west a location is, the higher\
      \ the longitude value in the west (like 110\xB0W is further west than 100\xB0\
      W). Wait, no, actually, longitude increases as you go east, but since they're\
      \ both in the western hemisphere (negative if using east/west), maybe it's better\
      \ to think in terms of decimal degrees. For example, Massachusetts is on the\
      \ east coast, so its longitude would be around -70 or -71 degrees. Arizona is\
      \ in the Mountain Time Zone, so maybe around -111 degrees? Wait, no, Phoenix\
      \ is around -112 degrees W longitude. Let me check that mentally.\n\nWait, let\
      \ me think. New York City is about -74 degrees. Boston, being a bit east, maybe\
      \ around -71. So Harvard in Cambridge, MA is probably around 71 degrees west\
      \ longitude. Arizona State in Tempe, AZ. Phoenix's longitude is approximately\
      \ 112 degrees west, so that's -112. So comparing -71 (Harvard) and -112 (ASU).\
      \ Since longitude west becomes more negative as you go west. Wait, no, actually,\
      \ longitude is measured from 0\xB0 at Greenwich, going east to 180\xB0E and\
      \ west to 180\xB0W. But in decimal terms, west longitudes are negative. So,\
      \ Harvard is at around -71\xB0, ASU at around -112\xB0. \n\nNow, when comparing\
      \ west/east positions: a location with a more negative longitude is further\
      \ west. So -112\xB0 is more west than -71\xB0, because -112 is smaller (more\
      \ negative) than -71. Therefore, Arizona State University is west of Harvard.\
      \ So the question is asking if Harvard is west of ASU. Since ASU is at -112\xB0\
      \ and Harvard at -71\xB0, Harvard is east of ASU. Therefore, the answer is NO.\n\
      </think>NO  \n**Explanation**: Harvard Summer School is located in Cambridge,\

      \ University in Tempe, Arizona, is at around -112\xB0W. Since -71\xB0W is east\

      \nHarvard University is in Cambridge, Massachusetts, right? And the Summer School\
      \ is part of Harvard, so it's in the same location. Arizona State University\
      \ is in Tempe, Arizona. Now, I need to compare their geographical positions,\
      \ specifically their longitudes because that determines east-west positioning.\n\
      \nI remember that the eastern United States is in the Eastern Time Zone, and\
      \ states like Massachusetts are there. Arizona is in the Mountain Time Zone,\
      \ but they don't observe daylight saving time, so sometimes it's the same as\
      \ Pacific Time. But more importantly, the longitude: places further west have\
      \ higher longitude values if we're using the western hemisphere's negative longitudes.\
      \ Wait, actually, in the US, longitudes are negative because they're west of\
      \ the prime meridian. So the more negative the longitude, the further west it\
      \ is. For example, California has more negative longitudes than New York.\n\n\
      So I need to find the longitude of Cambridge, MA, and Tempe, AZ. Let me think.\
      \ Cambridge is near Boston. The approximate longitude for Boston is around -71.06\

      \ (in the western hemisphere). So a location with a longitude of -112.07 is\
      \ further west than -71.06. Because -112 is more negative than -71, meaning\
      \ it's further west. So Tempe, AZ has a longitude of around -112, which is west\
      \ of Cambridge, MA at around -71. Therefore, Harvard in Massachusetts is east\
      \ of Arizona State University in Arizona. So the question is asking if Harvard\
      \ is west of ASU. Since Harvard is at a less negative longitude (higher value,\

      \ figure out where each of these universities is located geographically.\n\n\
      So, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison is in Madison, Wisconsin. I know Wisconsin\
      \ is in the Midwest, near the Great Lakes. Then UCLA is in Los Angeles, California,\
      \ which is on the West Coast. But just because California is a western state,\
      \ does that mean UCLA is further west than Madison? Wait, maybe not necessarily.\
      \ Let me think about the longitude coordinates.\n\nLongitude measures how far\
      \ east or west a location is. The higher the longitude (in the west), the more\
      \ west it is. But wait, in the US, the longitude is measured in degrees west,\
      \ so lower numbers are further east, and higher numbers (more west) are further\
      \ west. Wait, no, actually longitude for the US is typically in the western\
      \ hemisphere, so it's measured as degrees west of the prime meridian. So, for\
      \ example, Los Angeles is around 118 degrees West, and Madison, Wisconsin is\
      \ around 89 degrees West. Wait, so the larger the number (degrees West), the\
      \ further west the location is. So UCLA at 118\xB0W would be west of Madison\
      \ at 89\xB0W. Therefore, Madison is actually east of UCLA. So, the answer would\
      \ be NO, because UCLA is further west than the University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Madison.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I got the longitudes wrong.\
      \ Let me recall: Madison, WI's longitude is approximately 89.4\xB0 West. UCLA\
      \ in LA is around 118.4\xB0 West. Since 118.4 is greater than 89.4, that means\
      \ UCLA is further west. Therefore, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison\
      \ is east of UCLA. So the answer is NO, it's not west, it's east.\n</think>NO\
      \  \nThe University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison (located at ~89.4\xB0W longitude)\
      \ is east of UCLA (~118.4\xB0W). Since higher longitude values (west of the\
      \ prime meridian) indicate a more westerly location, UCLA is farther west. Thus,\
      \ Wisconsin\u2013Madison is east, not west, of UCLA."

      \ degrees West. Since west longitude increases as you go further west, but numerically,\
      \ when using negative values (as in decimal degrees), a more negative number\
      \ (like -118.4) is further west than -89.4. Wait, but when expressed as degrees\

    5c5059f2-ce79-46f6-9fb5-4bc7daf58792: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, we need to determine if the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison College\
      \ of Engineering, WI is located west of the University of California, Los Angeles,\
      \ CA. Hmm, first, I should figure out the locations of both universities. \n\
      \nStarting with the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. I know that Wisconsin\
      \ is in the Midwest, right? Madison is the capital of Wisconsin. Now, the University\
      \ of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) is obviously in Los Angeles, California.\

      \ is. Wait, actually, in the US, longitude is measured as west longitude, so\
      \ higher numbers going west from the prime meridian. So, a higher west longitude\
      \ means further west.\n\nLet me get the approximate longitudes for both cities.\
      \ For Madison, WI: I might need to recall or look it up. From my memory, Madison\
      \ is somewhere in the southern part of Wisconsin. I think that Wisconsin is\
      \ in the Central Time Zone. Meanwhile, Los Angeles is in the Pacific Time Zone,\
      \ which is further west. But maybe the exact longitudes are needed. \n\nWait,\
      \ the Central Time Zone is UTC-6, and Pacific is UTC-8, but time zones can be\
      \ a rough guide. But actual longitude is more precise. Let's think: The Central\
      \ Time Zone roughly spans from around 85\xB0W to 102\xB0W, but that's a broad\
      \ area. Madison is in the eastern part of the Central Time Zone. For example,\
      \ Chicago is around 87\xB0W. Madison is a bit west of Chicago, maybe around\
      \ 89\xB0W? Let me check my mental map. Chicago is at approximately 87.6\xB0\
      W. Madison is to the west of Chicago, but not by much. Maybe Madison is around\
      \ 89.4\xB0W. \n\nOn the other hand, Los Angeles is in California. UCLA's coordinates\
      \ are approximately 34.1\xB0N latitude and 118.4\xB0W longitude. So 118.4\xB0\
      W for UCLA. If Madison is around 89\xB0W, then UCLA is much further west. Wait,\
      \ because higher longitude west means further west. So 118\xB0W is further west\
      \ than 89\xB0W. Therefore, UCLA is west of Madison. Therefore, the University\

      \ not west. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Maybe my longitudes are off. Let\
      \ me verify. For Madison, WI, the exact longitude. A quick check in my mind:\
      \ Madison's coordinates are approximately 43.07\xB0N, 89.40\xB0W. Yes, that's\
      \ what I thought. So longitude is about 89.4\xB0W. UCLA is in Los Angeles, which\
      \ is around 34.05\xB0N, 118.24\xB0W. So UCLA is at 118.24\xB0W. Comparing 89.4\xB0\
      W and 118.24\xB0W: since 118 is larger than 89, UCLA is further west. Therefore,\
      \ Madison is east of UCLA, so the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison is located\

      \ The prime meridian is 0\xB0. Going west from there, the longitude increases\
      \ up to 180\xB0W, and going east, it increases up to 180\xB0E. So, for example,\

      \ California. So I need to compare the longitude of Madison, WI, with that of\
      \ Los Angeles, CA. Since the Earth is a sphere, longitude determines east-west\

      N, 89\xB0W. Los Angeles is around 34\xB0N, 118\xB0W. So 89\xB0W vs. 118\xB0\
      W. Since 89 is east of 118, because lower longitude (west) numbers are further\
      \ east. Wait, longitude west of the prime meridian increases as you go west.\
      \ So 118\xB0W is further west than 89\xB0W. Therefore, UCLA is west of Madison.\

      \ maybe Athens, GA has a longitude a little less west than Atlanta. Let me check\

      \ University is in Illinois. Northwestern's main campus is in Evanston, Illinois,\
      \ which is a suburb just north of Chicago. So Chicago is in the northeastern\

      \ so still in that northeastern corner of Illinois.\n\nNow, to compare their\

      \ west a location's longitude, the more west it is. Longitude is measured in\
      \ degrees west or east of the prime meridian. In the US, all longitudes are\
      \ west, so higher numerical values (more west) mean further west. \n\nSo I need\
      \ to find the longitude of Athens, GA, and Evanston, IL. Let me recall or think\
      \ of approximate longitudes. \n\nFor Evanston, IL (Northwestern University):\
      \ Chicago is around 87.6\xB0 W longitude. Since Evanston is just north of Chicago,\
      \ it's probably similar, maybe around 87.7\xB0 W or so. \n\nAthens, GA: Atlanta's\

      \ because you're moving towards the prime meridian. So Atlanta is 84.3\xB0 W.\
      \ If Athens is northeast, maybe it's a bit further east. So perhaps around 83.3\xB0\
      \ W?\n\nWait, but I might be getting this confused. Let me think. Suppose you\

      \ of Atlanta. Let's check the coordinates for Athens. A quick mental note: Athens,\
      \ GA coordinates are approximately 33.9559\xB0 N, 83.3833\xB0 W. So the longitude\
      \ is about 83.38\xB0 W. \n\nEvanston, IL: Coordinates are approximately 42.0451\xB0\
      \ N, 87.6877\xB0 W. So Evanston is at around 87.69\xB0 W longitude. \n\nComparing\
      \ the two: Athens, GA is at ~83.38\xB0 W, Evanston, IL is at ~87.69\xB0 W. Since\
      \ longitude west is measured as degrees from the prime meridian, a higher number\

      \ to Athens (83.38). That means Evanston is further west than Athens. Therefore,\

      \ So the original question was: Is UGA west of Northwestern? The answer would\
      \ be NO, because 83.38\xB0 W is east of 87.69\xB0 W. \n\nWait, but another way:\
      \ if a location is further west, it's longitude is higher (since moving west\
      \ increases the number). So 87.69 is higher than 83.38, so Evanston is west\

      \ Since 83\xB0W is less than 87.6\xB0W in numerical value (but since they are\
      \ both west, the one with the higher degree west is further west). Wait, longitude:\
      \ the higher the number in the west, the further west you are. So 87\xB0W is\
      \ further west than 83\xB0W. So Evanston, IL (Northwestern) is at around 87.6\xB0\

    dcda92dd-667b-45e9-a0dd-57312d0989cc: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, I need to figure out if the University of Georgia (UGA) in Georgia is\
      \ located west of Northwestern University in Illinois. Hmm, first, I should\
      \ recall where these two universities are situated. \n\nWait, the University\
      \ of Georgia is in Georgia, which is a state in the southeastern United States.\
      \ The main campus is in Athens, GA, I think. Northwestern University is in Illinois,\
      \ specifically in Evanston, which is just north of Chicago. So, Chicago is in\
      \ the northeastern part of Illinois. Now, comparing their longitudes should\
      \ help determine which is further west because longitude measures east-west\
      \ position.\n\nBut I might not remember the exact longitudes of Athens, GA,\
      \ and Evanston, IL. Let me think. Georgia is to the east of Illinois, right?\
      \ Because Illinois is in the Midwest, and Georgia is on the East Coast, more\
      \ towards the south. Wait, but actually, Illinois is more central. Let me visualize\
      \ a map. The southeastern states like Georgia, Alabama, etc., are on the eastern\
      \ side of the country. The Midwest includes states like Illinois, Indiana, Ohio.\
      \ So Illinois is west of Georgia? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me\
      \ get more precise.\n\nChicago, IL is around 87.6 degrees west longitude. Athens,\
      \ GA is approximately 83.4 degrees west longitude. Longitude lines run north-south,\
      \ with higher numbers going west. So if a location has a higher longitude (more\
      \ west), it's further west. For example, the prime meridian is 0 degrees, and\
      \ as you go west into the Americas, the longitude increases up to 180. So Evanston,\
      \ IL (Northwestern) at 87.6\xB0W is further west than Athens, GA at 83.4\xB0\
      W. Therefore, Northwestern University (IL) is west of UGA (GA). Conversely,\
      \ UGA is east of Northwestern. So the question is asking if UGA is west of Northwestern.\
      \ Since Northwestern is at a higher longitude (more west), the answer would\
      \ be NO, UGA is east of Northwestern. \n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I\
      \ mixed up the longitude numbers. Let me confirm. For Athens, GA: a quick recall,\
      \ Atlanta, GA is around 84.4\xB0W. Athens is a bit east of Atlanta, so maybe\
      \ around 83.4\xB0W as I thought. Evanston, IL, near Chicago, is indeed about\
      \ 87.6\xB0W. So 87.6 is further west. So Athens, GA (83.4\xB0W) is east, and\
      \ Evanston, IL (87.6\xB0W) is west. So UGA is east, Northwestern is west. Therefore,\
      \ the answer is NO, University of Georgia is not west of Northwestern. It's\
      \ actually east of Northwestern.\n</think>To determine if the University of\

      \  \n   - Evanston, IL (87.6\xB0W) has a higher longitude than Athens, GA (83.4\xB0\
      W), meaning Northwestern is farther west.  \n\n**Conclusion**: Since Northwestern\
      \ (IL) is west of UGA (GA), the answer is **NO**."
    e7d13b63-762f-4809-8c54-d3bd5f1ae794: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the University of Georgia (UGA) in Georgia is located west of Northwestern\
      \ University in Illinois. Hmm. I need to figure out the longitudes of both universities\
      \ because longitude determines east-west position. Places with higher longitude\
      \ values are further west.\n\nFirst, I should recall where these universities\
      \ are. University of Georgia is in Georgia, a state in the southeastern U.S.\
      \ Northwestern University is in Illinois, which is in the Midwest. But I need\
      \ to be precise. Let me think about their cities. UGA is in Athens, Georgia,\
      \ right? And Northwestern is in Evanston, Illinois, which is just north of Chicago.\
      \ \n\nNow, I need to find the longitude coordinates for both Athens, GA and\
      \ Evanston, IL. Longitude is measured in degrees, with higher numbers going\
      \ west from the prime meridian. So, if Athens has a lower longitude than Evanston,\
      \ then it would be east, and vice versa.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, the U.S. is\
      \ in the western hemisphere, so all longitudes are west of the prime meridian,\
      \ meaning they are negative when using the standard format where east is positive\
      \ and west is negative. Wait, no. Let me clarify. The standard for longitude\
      \ is from 0\xB0 at the prime meridian (Greenwich) going east to 180\xB0E and\
      \ west to 180\xB0W. But in many systems, especially digital like GPS, west longitudes\
      \ are expressed as negative numbers. So for example, New York might be around\
      \ -74\xB0 longitude. So, if a place has a more negative longitude (like -80\
      \ vs -70), it's actually further west. Wait, no: actually, lower numerical values\
      \ (more negative) are further west. So, for example, Los Angeles is around -118\xB0\
      , which is west of Chicago at -87.6\xB0.\n\nWait, but in terms of actual degrees\
      \ west, Chicago is around 87\xB0W, so 87.6\xB0W would be 87.6 degrees west of\
      \ the prime meridian. The University of Georgia's location, Athens, GA, I think\
      \ is around 83\xB0W. Let me confirm.\n\nAthens, GA: I recall that Atlanta, GA\
      \ is about 84.3880\xB0 W. But Athens is east of Atlanta, so its longitude should\
      \ be a bit east (so a smaller number in degrees west). Wait, if you are east\
      \ of Atlanta, you're moving toward the east coast, so longitude becomes a lower\
      \ number. For example, Atlanta is around 84.39\xB0W. Athens is northeast of\
      \ Atlanta, so maybe around 83.3\xB0W. Let me check. Wait, if I don't have exact\
      \ data, I need to think.\n\nAlternatively, think of major cities. Chicago, IL\
      \ is around 87.62\xB0W. Evanston is a suburb north of Chicago, so its longitude\
      \ should be close to that, maybe 87.69\xB0W. Let's say approximately 87.7\xB0\
      W. Athens, GA, being in the eastern part of Georgia, which is in the southeast.\
      \ Let's see: Georgia's eastern border is with South Carolina and the Atlantic\
      \ Ocean. So major cities like Savannah, GA are on the coast, around 81\xB0W.\
      \ Athens is inland but east of Atlanta, which is around 84\xB0W. So if Atlanta\
      \ is 84.38\xB0W, Athens is east, so perhaps around 83.4\xB0W. Let me approximate.\n\
      \nSo Evanston, IL is around 87.7\xB0W, and Athens, GA is around 83.4\xB0W. Since\
      \ 83.4 is east of 87.7 (because lower in west longitude means further east),\
      \ that would mean that Athens is east of Evanston. Therefore, the University\
      \ of Georgia is east of Northwestern University, so the answer is NO, it's not\
      \ west.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe I can think of\
      \ the states. Illinois is more to the west than Georgia. The state of Illinois\
      \ is in the Midwest, while Georgia is in the Southeast. So the University of\
      \ Georgia would be east of Northwestern in Illinois. So indeed, NO.\n</think>The\

    f93b6fc8-3d9f-4c03-b0c1-d2799fb5f2a0: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the University of Georgia (UGA) in Georgia is located west of Northwestern\
      \ University in Illinois. Hmm, let's start by recalling where these universities\
      \ are. \n\nFirst, I know that Northwestern University is in Evanston, Illinois,\
      \ which is a suburb just north of Chicago. Chicago is in the northern part of\
      \ Illinois, right along Lake Michigan. So Northwestern is probably near the\
      \ eastern edge of Illinois since Lake Michigan is to the east.\n\nNow, the University\
      \ of Georgia is in Athens, Georgia. Georgia is a state in the southeastern United\
      \ States. Athens is northeast of Atlanta, the capital. But I'm not exactly sure\
      \ about the exact coordinates. Wait, maybe I should think about the longitude\
      \ of both places. Longitude determines how east or west a location is. If UGA's\
      \ longitude is more to the west (i.e., a higher negative number if we're talking\
      \ about the western hemisphere), then it would be west of Northwestern.\n\n\
      Let me try to recall approximate longitudes. Chicago, being in Illinois, is\
      \ around 87.6\xB0 West longitude. Evanston would be very close to that. What\
      \ about Athens, GA? Atlanta's longitude is about 84.3\xB0 W, so Athens, being\
      \ east of Atlanta, might be a bit further east, maybe around 83.3\xB0 W? Wait,\
      \ or maybe I have that backwards. If Atlanta is in the west of Georgia, then\
      \ moving east would increase longitude? Wait no, longitude decreases as you\
      \ go east because it's measured from the prime meridian. For example, New York\
      \ is around 74\xB0 W, so it's more east than Chicago (87\xB0 W), hence a smaller\
      \ longitude number. So if Northwestern is around 87.6\xB0 W, and UGA is in Georgia,\
      \ which is east of Illinois, then UGA's longitude would be a smaller number,\
      \ meaning further east. Therefore, Northwestern is further west, and UGA is\
      \ east of it. So the answer would be NO, UGA is not west of Northwestern.\n\n\
      Wait, but wait, maybe I should check the exact coordinates. Let me think. The\
      \ University of Georgia in Athens: Athens, GA's coordinates are approximately\
      \ 33.9519\xB0 N, 83.3737\xB0 W. Northwestern University in Evanston, IL is around\
      \ 42.0503\xB0 N, 87.6742\xB0 W. Comparing the longitudes: Northwestern is at\
      \ 87.67\xB0 W, and UGA is at 83.37\xB0 W. Since 83.37 is less than 87.67, that\
      \ means UGA is east of Northwestern. Because a smaller longitude (more negative\
      \ is actually west, but when expressed as a positive number west of the prime\
      \ meridian, higher numbers are further west). Wait, longitude west is measured\
      \ as degrees west from 0\xB0 (Prime Meridian). So 87\xB0 W is further west than\
      \ 83\xB0 W. So Evanston, IL at 87.67\xB0 W is west of Athens, GA at 83.37\xB0\
      \ W. Therefore, the University of Georgia is located east of Northwestern University.\
      \ So the answer is NO.\n</think>The University of Georgia (Athens, GA) is at\
      \ approximately **83.37\xB0 W** longitude, while Northwestern University (Evanston,\

      \ step by step. The user wants to know if the Graduate School of Duke University\
      \ in North Carolina is located west of the University of Texas at Austin's College\
      \ of Liberal Arts in Texas. First, I need to figure out the locations of both\
      \ institutions and compare their longitudes since west and east are determined\
      \ by longitude.\n\nStarting with Duke University's Graduate School. I know Duke\
      \ is in Durham, North Carolina. Let me confirm that. Yes, Duke's main campus\
      \ is in Durham. So I should find the longitude of Durham, NC. \n\nNext, the\
      \ University of Texas at Austin's College of Liberal Arts is part of UT Austin,\
      \ which is located in Austin, Texas. So I need the longitude of Austin, TX.\n\
      \nNow, to determine which is further west, I need to compare these two longitudes.\
      \ Places with higher longitude values (more west) are further west if we're\
      \ considering the western hemisphere, but actually, in the context of the Earth's\
      \ coordinates, longitude increases as you go east from the prime meridian. Wait,\
      \ no\u2014wait, the prime meridian is 0\xB0, and longitude increases to the\
      \ east up to 180\xB0 and decreases to the west up to -180\xB0. So in the United\
      \ States, which is west of the prime meridian, all longitudes are negative when\
      \ using the conventional -180 to +180 system. For example, New York is around\
      \ -74\xB0, Los Angeles around -118\xB0. So the more negative the longitude,\
      \ the further west it is.\n\nSo if Durham, NC has a longitude that is less negative\
      \ (closer to zero) than Austin, TX's longitude, then Durham is east of Austin,\
      \ and Austin is west. But if Durham's longitude is more negative (further from\
      \ zero), then it's west.\n\nLet me look up the coordinates. Duke University\
      \ in Durham, NC: a quick search shows that Durham is approximately at latitude\
      \ 35.9940\xB0 N, longitude -78.8986\xB0 W. \n\nUniversity of Texas at Austin:\
      \ Austin, TX has coordinates roughly latitude 30.2672\xB0 N, longitude -97.7431\xB0\
      \ W.\n\nComparing the longitudes: Durham is at -78.8986\xB0, Austin at -97.7431\xB0\
      . Since -78.8986 is greater (less negative) than -97.7431, Durham is east of\
      \ Austin. Therefore, the Graduate School of Duke is east of UT Austin's College\

      \ 78.8986\xB0 W. Austin, TX is around 97.7431\xB0 W. So comparing 78.9\xB0W\
      \ (Duke) vs. 97.7\xB0W (UT Austin). Since 97.7 is a higher number (more west),\
      \ that means Austin is further west than Durham. Therefore, Duke is actually\

      \ of both universities and then compare their longitudes because west and east\
      \ are determined by longitude.\n\nLet me start with Duke University. I know\
      \ Duke is in North Carolina. The main campus is in Durham, NC. So I should find\
      \ the longitude of Durham. Then, the University of Texas at Austin is in Austin,\
      \ Texas. The College of Liberal Arts is part of UT Austin, so it's in the same\
      \ location as the main campus. I need the longitude of Austin, Texas.\n\nNow,\
      \ I need to recall or look up the approximate longitudes of these two cities.\
      \ From what I remember, the US states' longitudes generally increase as you\
      \ move west. North Carolina is on the East Coast, and Texas is in the South\
      \ Central part of the US. Austin is in central Texas, which is definitely west\
      \ of North Carolina. But let me get more precise.\n\nDurham, NC: I think it's\
      \ around 78 degrees west longitude. Wait, no, that might be Raleigh. Let me\
      \ think. The eastern part of the US is in the 70s to 80s west longitude. For\
      \ example, New York City is around 74\xB0W. North Carolina is a bit further\
      \ south but still on the East Coast. So Durham might be around 78\xB0W to 79\xB0\
      W. Let me check that. If I recall correctly, Raleigh, NC is approximately 78.64\xB0\
      W. Since Durham is nearby, maybe around 78.9\xB0W.\n\nAustin, TX: Central Texas.\
      \ I know that Texas spans from around 93\xB0W to 106\xB0W. Austin is in the\
      \ central part, so maybe around 97.7\xB0W. For example, the coordinates for\
      \ Austin are approximately 30.25\xB0N, 97.75\xB0W. So that's about 97.75\xB0\
      W.\n\nComparing the two: If Durham is around 78.9\xB0W and Austin is 97.75\xB0\
      W, then Austin is further west. Wait, but longitude increases as you go west,\
      \ so a higher degree west means further west. So 97.75\xB0W is more west than\
      \ 78.9\xB0W. Therefore, Austin is west of Durham. Therefore, Duke's Graduate\

    5f16522f-4a6e-46ab-b448-b0fff94a9642: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, we need to determine if Duke University's Graduate School in North Carolina\
      \ is located west of the University of Texas at Austin's College of Liberal\
      \ Arts in Texas. The answer should be a simple YES or NO, but I need to figure\
      \ it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall where these two universities\
      \ are located. Duke University is in North Carolina, right? Specifically, I\
      \ think it's in Durham, NC. The University of Texas at Austin is obviously in\
      \ Austin, Texas. Now, the question is about their relative positions east or\
      \ west of each other.\n\nTo compare their longitudes. Places further west have\
      \ higher longitude values if we're using the western hemisphere (like the US),\
      \ which is typically measured in degrees west of the Prime Meridian. But sometimes\
      \ longitude can be represented as negative numbers (with negative being west).\
      \ So, I need to find the longitude coordinates of both Durham, NC and Austin,\
      \ TX.\n\nLet me try to remember or estimate. I know that the eastern US is,\
      \ well, in the east, and Texas is in the central part, but more towards the\
      \ west compared to the East Coast. So, Texas should be west of North Carolina.\
      \ Wait, but maybe not? Let me think more carefully.\n\nNorth Carolina is on\
      \ the East Coast, right? So cities like Raleigh, Durham are in the eastern part\
      \ of the US. Texas is in the south-central part. Austin is in central Texas.\
      \ So, comparing the two, I think Austin would be west of Durham. Therefore,\
      \ Duke University (Durham, NC) would be east of UT Austin, so the answer would\
      \ be NO, Duke is not west of UT Austin.\n\nBut maybe I should get the exact\
      \ longitudes to be sure. Let me try to recall approximate longitudes. For example,\
      \ the east coast cities like New York are around 74 degrees west longitude.\
      \ North Carolina is a bit south of NY but still east. Durham, NC's longitude\
      \ is approximately 78 degrees west? Wait, that can't be. Wait, no. Wait, New\
      \ York City is around 74\xB0W, and as you go south along the coast, the longitude\
      \ might decrease (become less west) or increase? Wait, longitude lines run north-south,\
      \ so moving west within the same latitude would increase the longitude west.\
      \ Hmm, maybe I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking at approximate\
      \ positions. Let me visualize a US map. Texas is to the west of the Mississippi\
      \ River. North Carolina is on the East Coast. So Austin, TX is definitely west\
      \ of Durham, NC. Therefore, Duke University is east of UT Austin, so the answer\
      \ is NO, it's not west.\n\nBut maybe I should confirm the actual longitudes.\
      \ Let me think. Durham, NC: I recall that Raleigh, the capital, is at about\
      \ 78.6\xB0W. So Durham is near there, so around 78.7\xB0W perhaps. Austin, TX:\
      \ I think it's around 97.7\xB0W. Because Texas is in the Central Time Zone,\
      \ which is UTC-6, whereas North Carolina is in Eastern Time (UTC-5). The time\
      \ zones roughly correspond to 75\xB0W (Eastern) and 90\xB0W (Central), but actual\
      \ longitudes can vary. Wait, Austin's longitude is more west. For example, Dallas\
      \ is around 96.8\xB0W, so Austin is a bit west of that? Or maybe not. Let me\
      \ check approximate coordinates:\n\nDurham, NC: Latitude: 35.9940\xB0 N, Longitude:\
      \ 78.8986\xB0 W\n\nAustin, TX: Latitude: 30.2672\xB0 N, Longitude: 97.7431\xB0\
      \ W\n\nYes, so Durham's longitude is approximately 78.9\xB0W, and Austin is\
      \ about 97.7\xB0W. Since longitude increases as you go west (in the western\
      \ hemisphere), a higher number means further west. Austin's longitude is more\
      \ west (higher number) than Durham's. Therefore, Duke University in Durham is\
      \ east of UT Austin. So the answer is NO, the Graduate School of Duke University\
      \ is not west of the University of Texas at Austin's College of Liberal Arts.\n\

      \ step by step. So the question is asking if the Graduate School of Duke University\

      \ west.\n\nFirst, I know that Duke University is in North Carolina. From what\
      \ I remember, Duke is in Durham, NC. The University of Texas at Austin is, well,\
      \ in Austin, Texas. Now, I need to find out the geographic coordinates of both\
      \ cities to see their positions relative to each other, specifically their longitude,\
      \ since that determines east-west positioning.\n\nLet me recall: the further\
      \ west a location is, the higher its longitude value will be in the western\
      \ hemisphere (since longitude increases as you go east from the Prime Meridian,\
      \ but wait, actually in the Americas, which are west of the Prime Meridian,\
      \ the longitude is measured as west, so higher numerical values (more west)\
      \ would correspond to more negative when expressed as degrees west. Wait, no\u2014\
      longitude can be measured as either east or west, with 0\xB0 being the Prime\
      \ Meridian. So, for locations in the United States, which are west of the Prime\
      \ Meridian, their longitude is typically given as degrees west (W), so for example,\
      \ New York might be around 74\xB0W, and Los Angeles around 118\xB0W. The more\
      \ west you go in the US, the higher the numerical value in the west longitude,\
      \ but when converted to a numerical format, it's often negative (e.g., -74\xB0\
      , -118\xB0) since east is positive. So when comparing two longitudes, the more\
      \ negative the longitude (i.e., the further west), the smaller the number if\
      \ considering numerical value, but in terms of westness, a longitude of -100\xB0\
      \ is further west than -80\xB0.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let's clarify.\
      \ Longitude ranges from 0\xB0 at the Prime Meridian to 180\xB0E and 180\xB0\
      W (which are the same line). Points to the east of the Prime Meridian have positive\
      \ longitude values (up to 180\xB0E) and points to the west have negative values\
      \ (or up to 180\xB0W, but in terms of numbers, when using decimal degrees, west\
      \ longitudes are negative). So, for example, if Duke University in Durham, NC\
      \ has a longitude of around -78.9\xB0 (which is 78.9\xB0W) and the University\
      \ of Texas at Austin has a longitude of around -97.7\xB0 (97.7\xB0W), then Austin\
      \ would be further west because -97.7 is more west than -78.9. Wait, but in\
      \ terms of numerical value, -97.7 is less than -78.9, so when comparing west\
      \ to east, the more negative the longitude, the further west it is. So, Duke\
      \ is at approximately -78.9\xB0, Austin at -97.7\xB0. Therefore, Austin is west\
      \ of Duke. But the question is asking if Duke is west of Austin. Since Austin\
      \ is at a more western longitude (more negative), that would mean Duke is east\
      \ of Austin, not west. Therefore, the answer would be NO.\n\nBut wait, let me\
      \ double-check the actual longitudes to be sure. I'm recalling that Texas is\
      \ further west than North Carolina. The state of Texas is in the central part\
      \ of the southern US, while North Carolina is on the East Coast. So Austin,\
      \ being in Texas, is definitely west of Durham, NC. Therefore, the Graduate\

      \ Places with higher longitude values are further west. So, I should find the\
      \ longitude coordinates for both cities. \n\nLet me look up the approximate\
      \ longitudes. Charlottesville, VA: I remember that Virginia is around -78 degrees\
      \ longitude. Let me confirm. Yes, Charlottesville's longitude is approximately\
      \ -78.47 degrees. \n\nNow, College Station, TX. Texas is further west, so I\
      \ expect a more negative longitude (since in the US, longitudes are west of\
      \ the prime meridian, so they're negative). Wait, no\u2014actually, longitude\
      \ west of the prime meridian is measured in negative degrees. So, the more west\
      \ you go in the US, the more negative the longitude becomes. Wait, no, that's\
      \ not right. Wait, longitude is measured from 0 at the prime meridian (Greenwich,\
      \ UK) going east to 180 and west to -180. So, locations in the US are west of\
      \ the prime meridian, so their longitudes are negative. The further west you\
      \ go in the US, the more negative the longitude becomes. For example, New York\
      \ is around -74, Chicago around -87, Los Angeles around -118. So, Texas is west\
      \ of Virginia, so College Station should have a more negative longitude than\
      \ Charlottesville.\n\nWait, but let me get the exact longitude for College Station.\
      \ College Station, TX is approximately -96.31 degrees longitude. So, Charlottesville\
      \ is at -78.47, College Station at -96.31. Since -96.31 is more negative (i.e.,\
      \ further west) than -78.47, that means College Station is west of Charlottesville.\
      \ Therefore, the University of Virginia (in Charlottesville) is east of Texas\
      \ A&M (in College Station). So, the answer would be NO, UVA is not west of Texas\
      \ A&M; it's actually east of it.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I mixed\
      \ up the longitudes. Let me confirm. Yes, Charlottesville, VA: 38.03\xB0 N,\
      \ 78.47\xB0 W. Wait, but longitude is written as 78.47\xB0 W, which is equivalent\
      \ to -78.47. College Station, TX: 30.61\xB0 N, 96.31\xB0 W, which is -96.31.\
      \ So, since -96.31 is less than -78.47, College Station is further west. Therefore,\
      \ UVA is east of Texas A&M. So the answer is NO.\n</think>To determine if the\
      \ University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville, VA, is west of Texas A&M\

    2d5426b1-87f9-4c52-897c-63f16aba539f: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the University of Virginia (UVA) in Virginia is located west of Texas A&M\
      \ University in Texas. Let me start by recalling the general locations of both\
      \ states. Virginia is on the east coast of the United States, while Texas is\
      \ in the southern central part. Texas is a large state, and Texas A&M is in\
      \ College Station, Texas. UVA is in Charlottesville, Virginia. \n\nFirst, I\
      \ should figure out the approximate longitudes of both cities since longitude\
      \ determines east-west positioning. Places with a higher longitude (more west)\
      \ are further west. Wait, actually, in the US, longitude is measured from the\
      \ prime meridian, so as you go west from the prime meridian (which passes through\
      \ Greenwich, England), the longitude increases in the western hemisphere. But\
      \ in terms of the US, the eastern states have lower longitude numbers (more\
      \ negative if we consider west longitudes as negative, but sometimes they're\
      \ just referred to as degrees west). Hmm, maybe I should check the actual coordinates.\n\
      \nLet me look up the longitude of Charlottesville, VA. From memory, Virginia\
      \ is on the east coast, so cities there like Richmond, Charlottesville would\
      \ be around 78-79 degrees west longitude. Texas A&M is in College Station, TX.\
      \ Texas is a big state, stretching from around 93 degrees west in the east (like\
      \ Beaumont) to about 106 degrees west in the west (like El Paso). College Station\
      \ is in eastern Texas, closer to Houston. So maybe College Station's longitude\
      \ is around 96 degrees west?\n\nWait, let me confirm. I think Austin, TX is\
      \ around 97-98 degrees west. College Station is northeast of Austin, so maybe\
      \ it's a bit further east, maybe around 96.5 degrees west. And Charlottesville,\
      \ VA is approximately around 78.5 degrees west. If College Station is at 96.5W\
      \ and Charlottesville is at 78.5W, then Charlottesville is actually east of\
      \ College Station because 78.5W is less than 96.5W. Wait, but longitude west\
      \ increases as you go west. So lower longitude (closer to 0) is more east. So\
      \ if Charlottesville's longitude is 78.5\xB0W and College Station is 96.5\xB0\
      W, then Charlottesville is to the east of College Station. Therefore, UVA is\
      \ east of Texas A&M, so the answer would be NO.\n</think>To determine if the\

    5096a01c-11f1-4c4c-928b-df4f6c50b330: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the University of Virginia (UVA) in Virginia is located west of Texas\
      \ A&M University in Texas. Hmm, I need to figure out the geographical positions\
      \ of both universities. \n\nFirst, I should recall where each university is.\
      \ UVA is in Charlottesville, Virginia. Texas A&M is in College Station, Texas.\
      \ Now, I need to compare their longitudes because that determines east-west\
      \ positioning. The further west a location is, the higher its longitude (in\
      \ the Western Hemisphere, longitude is measured in degrees west from the prime\
      \ meridian, so higher numbers are further west).\n\nWait, actually, in the US,\
      \ all longitudes are west of the prime meridian, so they're all negative when\
      \ expressed in decimal degrees (like -77 for Charlottesville). But when comparing,\
      \ a smaller number (less negative) is more east, and a larger number (more negative)\
      \ is more west. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Longitude increases\
      \ as you go east from the prime meridian up to 180 degrees, but in the US, which\
      \ is west of the prime meridian, the longitude is measured as west longitude,\
      \ so for example, New York is around 74 degrees west, which would be -74 in\
      \ decimal. So, when comparing two places in the western hemisphere, the one\
      \ with the higher numerical value (less negative) is more east, and the one\
      \ with the lower numerical value (more negative) is more west. Wait, no, that's\
      \ confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nIf we take two points: Point A has a longitude\
      \ of -80 (which is 80 degrees west), and Point B is -90 (90 degrees west). Which\
      \ is further west? The one with 90 degrees west is further west because 90 is\
      \ a larger number west of the prime meridian. So, in decimal terms, -90 is further\
      \ west than -80. So, when comparing two negative longitudes, the more negative\
      \ one is further west. So, the lower the number (more negative), the further\
      \ west.\n\nSo, to determine if UVA is west of Texas A&M, I need to check if\
      \ the longitude of UVA is more west (i.e., a lower, more negative number) than\
      \ that of Texas A&M.\n\nNow, let's find the exact longitudes. \n\nUniversity\
      \ of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA: Let me recall. Charlottesville is in central\
      \ Virginia. I think its longitude is around -78.4 or something. Let me check\
      \ in my mind. Maybe 78 degrees west, so -78.4.\n\nTexas A&M in College Station,\
      \ TX: College Station is in east-central Texas. Texas is a big state, but College\
      \ Station is not in the far west of Texas. I think its longitude is around -96.3\
      \ or so. Wait, no, that might be too far west. Wait, cities like Austin are\
      \ around -97.7, but College Station is east of Austin. Wait, maybe College Station\
      \ is around -96.3. Let me think. For example, Houston is about -95.3, and College\
      \ Station is northwest of Houston. So maybe College Station is around -96.3.\
      \ Let me confirm: I think College Station's coordinates are approximately 30.6\xB0\
      \ N, 96.3\xB0 W. So longitude -96.3.\n\nUVA's coordinates: Charlottesville is\
      \ approximately 38.03\xB0 N, 78.48\xB0 W. So longitude -78.48.\n\nComparing\
      \ the two: Texas A&M is at -96.3, UVA at -78.48. Since -78.48 is a higher number\
      \ (less negative) than -96.3, that means UVA is east of Texas A&M. Because the\
      \ more negative the longitude, the further west. So Texas A&M is further west.\

      College Station is north of Houston, which is around -95.3 degrees. So maybe\
      \ College Station is around -96.3 degrees? Wait, if Houston is at -95.3, then\

      \ the University of Virginia (UVA) in Virginia is located west of Texas A&M\
      \ University in Texas. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst,\
      \ I need to know the locations of both universities. Let's start with UVA. The\
      \ University of Virginia is in Charlottesville, Virginia. I remember that Virginia\
      \ is on the East Coast, right? It's one of the original 13 colonies. Charlottesville\
      \ is somewhere in the central part of the state, maybe a bit towards the north.\n\
      \nNow, Texas A&M is in College Station, Texas. Texas is a big state in the southern\
      \ part of the US, known for being quite large. College Station is in eastern\
      \ Texas, I think. I recall it's near some other cities like Houston or Austin,\
      \ but not exactly sure. Wait, College Station is actually northeast of Austin,\
      \ maybe about 100 miles away. So eastern Texas.\n\nNext, I need to compare their\
      \ longitudes because that determines east-west positioning. Places with higher\
      \ longitude numbers (more west) are further west. Wait, no, longitude is measured\
      \ from the prime meridian. So as you go west from the prime meridian (which\
      \ is in Greenwich, England), the longitude increases in the Western Hemisphere\
      \ but actually, longitude in the western hemisphere is measured as west longitude,\
      \ so higher numbers going west. Wait, actually, in the US, all longitudes are\
      \ west of the prime meridian, so they are in the western hemisphere. So higher\
      \ longitude values (more west) would mean further west. Wait, no, wait. Let\
      \ me clarify: For the United States, which is in the Western Hemisphere, longitude\
      \ is measured as degrees west of the prime meridian. So a higher degree of west\
      \ longitude means a location is further west. For example, a longitude of 100\xB0\
      W is further west than 80\xB0W. Wait, actually, no. Wait, longitude increases\
      \ as you go east from the prime meridian up to 180\xB0, but in the western hemisphere,\
      \ it's measured as west longitude. So for example, 80\xB0W is 80 degrees west\
      \ of the prime meridian. If a place is at 100\xB0W, that's further west than\
      \ 80\xB0W. So the higher the number in west longitude, the further west the\
      \ location is.\n\nSo I need to find the approximate longitudes of Charlottesville,\
      \ VA and College Station, TX.\n\nLet me recall or think of major cities nearby.\
      \ For Charlottesville, Virginia. I know that Washington D.C. is around 77\xB0\
      W longitude. Charlottesville is southwest of D.C., so maybe around 78\xB0W or\
      \ 78.5\xB0W? Let me check my memory. Alternatively, the approximate longitude\
      \ of Charlottesville, VA. Quick search in my mind: I think Charlottesville is\
      \ approximately at 78.47\xB0W. \n\nFor College Station, TX. Texas is a big state.\
      \ College Station is in the eastern part. Let's think, Houston is around 95\xB0\
      W. Wait, no, Houston is in southeast Texas. Wait, actually, Texas spans from\
      \ about 93\xB0W (east) to around 106\xB0W (west). College Station is in eastern\
      \ Texas. Let me think. Austin is around 97.7\xB0W. College Station is northeast\
      \ of Austin. Maybe around 96.3\xB0W? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, if I\
      \ recall that College Station is near the 96th meridian west. Let's say approximately\
      \ 96.3\xB0W.\n\nIf Charlottesville is around 78.5\xB0W and College Station is\
      \ around 96.3\xB0W, then College Station has a higher west longitude, meaning\
      \ it's further west. Therefore, UVA would be east of Texas A&M. So the answer\
      \ would be NO, UVA is not west of Texas A&M; it's east.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe\
      \ my longitude figures are off. Let me confirm. For example, if Charlottesville\
      \ is indeed around 78\xB0W and College Station is around 96\xB0W, then 96 is\
      \ further west than 78, so College Station is west of Charlottesville. Therefore,\
      \ Charlottesville is east of College Station. So the question is: Is UVA west\
      \ of Texas A&M? Since UVA is at a lower longitude (more east), the answer is\
      \ NO.\n</think>To determine if the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville,\
      \ VA, is west of Texas A&M University in College Station, TX, we compare their\
      \ longitudes. \n\n- **UVA (Charlottesville, VA)**: Approximately **78.5\xB0\
      W** longitude.  \n- **Texas A&M (College Station, TX)**: Approximately **96.3\xB0\
      W** longitude.  \n\nSince higher west longitude values indicate a more western\
      \ location, Texas A&M (96.3\xB0W) is further west than UVA (78.5\xB0W). Therefore,\
      \ UVA is **east** of Texas A&M.  \n\n**Answer**: NO"
    f8c59fb6-af2c-425a-922b-3e5c184472b6: "<think>Okay, let's figure this out. The\
      \ question is whether the University of Virginia (UVA) in Virginia is located\
      \ west of Texas A&M University in Texas.\n\nFirst, I need to recall where each\
      \ university is located. UVA is in Charlottesville, Virginia. Texas A&M is in\
      \ College Station, Texas. Now, I need to compare their longitudes because that's\
      \ what determines east-west positioning. The further west a location is, the\
      \ higher its longitude value (in the Western Hemisphere, longitude increases\
      \ as you go west from the prime meridian, but actually wait\u2014no, in the\
      \ US, which is west of the prime meridian, longitude is measured as west degrees.\
      \ So higher longitude west means further west. Wait, no, longitude in the US\
      \ is typically denoted as west longitude, so for example, 80\xB0W is east of\
      \ 90\xB0W. Because 80\xB0W is closer to the prime meridian (0\xB0), so moving\
      \ west from the prime meridian, the longitude numbers increase. So College Station,\
      \ TX, being further west than Charlottesville, VA, should have a higher longitude\
      \ value (more west). Wait, but longitude is measured as degrees west, so a higher\
      \ numerical value in the west direction means further west. So if Texas A&M\
      \ is in Texas, which is west of Virginia, then its longitude should be a higher\
      \ number (more west). Let me check approximate longitudes.\n\nCharlottesville,\
      \ VA: I think it's around 78.5\xB0W. College Station, TX is around 96.3\xB0\
      W. So 96.3\xB0W is further west than 78.5\xB0W. Therefore, Texas A&M is west\
      \ of UVA. So the question is asking if UVA is west of Texas A&M. Since Texas\
      \ A&M is at 96.3\xB0W and UVA at 78.5\xB0W, that means UVA is east of Texas\
      \ A&M. Therefore, the answer is NO. UVA is not west of Texas A&M; it's actually\
      \ east.\n</think>NO  \nThe University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville,\
      \ VA, is located at approximately **78.5\xB0W** longitude, while Texas A&M University\
      \ in College Station, TX, is at **96.3\xB0W**. Since higher west longitude values\
      \ indicate a location further west, Texas A&M is significantly west of UVA.\
      \ Thus, UVA is **east** of Texas A&M, not west.  \n\n**Answer: NO**"
    ffd165e2-d0de-4e13-83b9-de7d724973fb: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the University of Virginia (UVA) in Virginia is located west of Texas\
      \ A&M University in Texas. Hmm, I need to figure out the geographic positions\
      \ of both universities. \n\nFirst, I should recall where each university is.\
      \ UVA is in Charlottesville, Virginia. Texas A&M is in College Station, Texas.\
      \ Now, I need to compare their longitudes because that determines east-west\
      \ positioning. The more west a location is, the higher its longitude value in\
      \ the western hemisphere (since longitude increases going west from the prime\
      \ meridian up to 180 degrees, but in the US, all are west of the prime meridian,\
      \ so higher longitude means further west). Wait, no, actually in the US, longitude\
      \ is measured as west longitude, so a higher numerical value (more west) would\
      \ mean further west. For example, California has a higher longitude (more west)\
      \ than Texas.\n\nWait, no, longitude for the US is in the western hemisphere,\
      \ so it's measured as degrees west of the prime meridian. So, for example, New\
      \ York is around 74\xB0W, while Los Angeles is around 118\xB0W. So the higher\
      \ the longitude number (in the west), the further west the location. So if Texas\
      \ A&M is in Texas, which is west of Virginia, then Texas A&M should be further\
      \ west than UVA. But let me check the exact coordinates.\n\nLooking up the coordinates:\
      \ University of Virginia in Charlottesville, VA is approximately 38.03\xB0 N\
      \ latitude, 78.48\xB0 W longitude. Texas A&M in College Station, TX is around\
      \ 30.61\xB0 N, 96.34\xB0 W. \n\nComparing the longitudes: UVA is at 78.48\xB0\
      W, Texas A&M at 96.34\xB0W. Since 96.34 is a higher number (more west) than\
      \ 78.48, that means Texas A&M is further west than UVA. Therefore, UVA is east\
      \ of Texas A&M. So the question is asking if UVA is west of Texas A&M. The answer\
      \ would be NO, because Texas A&M is further west.\n</think>The University of\
      \ Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville, VA, has a longitude of approximately **78.48\xB0\
      \ W**, while Texas A&M University in College Station, TX, is located at **96.34\xB0\
      \ W**. Since a higher longitude value (in the western hemisphere) indicates\
      \ a position further west, Texas A&M is west of UVA. Therefore, UVA is **not**\
      \ west of Texas A&M.\n\n**ANSWER: NO**"
