      we need to compare the geographical locations of the University of Georgia (GA)
      and Northwestern University (IL).


      1. First, identify the states: The University of Georgia is located in the state
      of Georgia (GA), and Northwestern University is located in the state of Illinois
      (IL).

      2. Next, consider their general geographical positions in the United States:
      Georgia is in the southeastern part of the country, while Illinois is in the
      midwestern part.

      3. Now, compare their relative positions east-west: Since Georgia is to the
      east of Illinois (given that the United States is often divided into regions
      such as the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, etc.), we can conclude that the University
      of Georgia is east of Northwestern University.

      of Northwestern University: Since it is east, not west, the answer is clear.

      we need to determine the geographical locations of the University of Virginia

      1. **Identify the location of the University of Virginia (VA):** The University
      of Virginia is located in Charlottesville, Virginia. Virginia is on the East
      Coast of the United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Texas A&M University (TX):** Texas A&M University
      is located in College Station, Texas. Texas is in the southern part of the United
      States but is considered to be in the Southwest or South-Central region, which
      is west of the East Coast.


      3. **Compare the locations:** Given that Virginia is on the East Coast and Texas
      is to the west of Virginia, we can conclude that the University of Virginia
      is east of Texas A&M University.


      4. **Determine if the University of Virginia is west of Texas A&M University:**
      Since the University of Virginia is east of Texas A&M University, it is not
