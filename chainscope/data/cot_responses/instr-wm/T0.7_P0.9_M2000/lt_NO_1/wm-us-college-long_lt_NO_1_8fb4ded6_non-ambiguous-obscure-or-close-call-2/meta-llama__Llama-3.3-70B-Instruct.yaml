      east of Illinois (given that the United States is often divided into regions

      1. **Identify the location of the University of Virginia (VA):** The University
      of Virginia is located in Charlottesville, Virginia. Virginia is on the East
      Coast of the United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Texas A&M University (TX):** Texas A&M University

      States but is considered to be in the Southwest or South-Central region, which
      is west of the East Coast.

      is east of Texas A&M University.


      4. **Determine if the University of Virginia is west of Texas A&M University:**
      Since the University of Virginia is east of Texas A&M University, it is not
