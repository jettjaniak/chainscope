      - Los Angeles is near the western edge of the continental United States.

      - Detroit is much further east, roughly in the eastern half of the country.

      - Therefore, Detroit is east of Los Angeles, not west.

      First, I need to clarify what "Australia, Cuba" refers to. There''s no place
      called "Australia, Cuba" - Australia is a country/continent in the southern
      hemisphere, and Cuba is a country in the Caribbean. These are two separate places.


      If the question is asking about either Australia or Cuba being west of San Antonio
      (which is in Texas, USA):

      - Cuba is located in the Caribbean, southeast of Florida. San Antonio is in
      Texas, which is west of Florida. Therefore, Cuba is east of San Antonio, not
      west.

      - Australia is located in the southern hemisphere across the Pacific Ocean.
      If we look at a world map, Australia is actually west of San Antonio if we go
      far enough west across the Pacific Ocean (since the Earth is round).


      However, I think there might be confusion in the question. If it''s asking about
      a place called "Australia" within Cuba, I''m not aware of any significant location
      in Cuba named Australia.


      Based on the standard locations of the countries mentioned:


      NO, Cuba is not west of San Antonio. And if the question is about the country
      Australia, the most direct answer would also be NO, as Australia is typically
      considered to be in the Eastern Hemisphere relative to the United States.'
