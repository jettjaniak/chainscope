      2. The Upper East Side is a neighborhood in Manhattan, New York City, which

      States, located on the east coast of the country. It is situated at approximately
      73.8 degrees west longitude.


      Now, comparing the longitudes:

      - Berlin is at 13.4 degrees east.

      - Queens is at 73.8 degrees west.


      Since Berlin is east of the Prime Meridian (0 degrees) and Queens is west of
      the Prime Meridian, Berlin is indeed located east of Queens.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Berlin located west of Queens?" is
      NO.'
