      1. Identify the location of Machupicchu District.

      2. Identify the location of San Diego.

      3. Compare their longitudinal coordinates to determine which is farther west.


      **Step 1: Location of Machupicchu District**

      - Machupicchu District is located in Peru, in the Andes Mountains.

      - It is part of the Urubamba Province in the Cusco Region.

      - Its approximate longitude is around **-72.5 degrees**.


      **Step 2: Location of San Diego**

      - San Diego is a city in the state of California, USA.

      - It lies on the west coast of the United States.

      - Its approximate longitude is around **-117.2 degrees**.


      **Step 3: Compare longitudes**

      - Longitude is measured in degrees east or west of the Prime Meridian (0 degrees).

      - The more negative (or lower) the value in the Western Hemisphere, the farther
      west the location is.

      - San Diego: -117.2

      - Machupicchu: -72.5


      Since -117.2 < -72.5, San Diego is farther west than Machupicchu.
