      2. **Understand the geography**: Arizona is a state in the southwestern United

      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Generally, the southern part of the United States

    e4562ba8-0d59-416b-91f4-22ea0952eaa2: 'To answer this question, let''s consider
      the geographical locations of both universities.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Stanford University is located in Stanford, California,
      which is in the San Francisco Bay Area, in the northern part of the state. University
      of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) is located in Santa Barbara, California,
      which is on the central coast of California but is south of the San Francisco
      Bay Area.


      2. **Compare the locations**: The San Francisco Bay Area, where Stanford University
      is situated, is generally north of Santa Barbara. California''s geography moves
      from north to south, with the Bay Area being further north and Santa Barbara
      being more towards the southern part of the state''s coastal region.


      3. **Conclusion**: Given that Stanford University is in the northern part of
      California and University of California, Santa Barbara is to its south, the
      answer to whether Stanford University is located south of University of California,
      Santa Barbara is NO.

      the locations of both Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine and
      the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University, and then
      compare their geographical positions.


      1. **Location of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine**: Cornell
      University is located in Ithaca, New York. The College of Veterinary Medicine
      is one of the colleges within Cornell University, so it is also in Ithaca, NY.


      2. **Location of School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University**:
      Columbia University is located in New York City, specifically in Manhattan.
      The School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) is part of Columbia University,
      so it is also located in Manhattan, NY.


      3. **Comparing Locations**: Ithaca, NY, where Cornell University''s College
      of Veterinary Medicine is located, is generally considered to be north of New
      York City, where Columbia University''s SIPA is located. To determine if it
      is south, we must consider the geographical relationship between these two locations.
      Given that Ithaca is north of NYC, Cornell University College of Veterinary
      Medicine would not be south of the School of International and Public Affairs
      at Columbia University.


      Therefore, based on the geographical positions, the answer to whether Cornell
      University College of Veterinary Medicine, NY is located south of the School
      of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, NY is: **NO**.'

      York, which is in the northeastern part of the United States.


      2. **University of California, San Francisco, CA**: This university is located
      in the state of California, specifically in the city of San Francisco, which
