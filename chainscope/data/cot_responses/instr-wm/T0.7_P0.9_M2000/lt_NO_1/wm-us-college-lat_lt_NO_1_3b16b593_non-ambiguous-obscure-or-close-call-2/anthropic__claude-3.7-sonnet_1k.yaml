      Let me think about the geographic locations:

      - Boston University is in Boston, Massachusetts, which is in the northeastern
      United States

      - Duke University is in Durham, North Carolina, which is in the southeastern
      United States

      - Massachusetts is generally north of North Carolina

      - Boston is in the northern part of Massachusetts

      - Durham is in the central part of North Carolina


      Since Massachusetts is north of North Carolina, Boston University would be north
      of Duke University, not south of it.

      2. University of Virginia (UVA) is located in Charlottesville, Virginia (VA).


      I need to determine which one is further north or south. In the US, Massachusetts
      is in the northeast, while Virginia is in the mid-Atlantic region, more to the
      south.


      Let me think about their relative positions:

      - Massachusetts is generally north of Virginia.

      - Cambridge, MA is in the eastern part of Massachusetts.

      - Charlottesville, VA is in the central part of Virginia.


      Since Massachusetts is north of Virginia on a map of the United States, MIT
      (in Massachusetts) would be north of UVA (in Virginia).


      If something is north of something else, it cannot be south of it. So MIT is
      not south of UVA.</think>I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts
      (MA).

      - University of Virginia (UVA) is located in Charlottesville, Virginia (VA).


      Step 2: Compare the states geographically.

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States.

      - Virginia is in the mid-Atlantic region, south of Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states.

      - Cambridge is in eastern Massachusetts.

      - Charlottesville is in central Virginia.


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      - Since Massachusetts is entirely north of Virginia on the map, MIT must be
      north of UVA.

      Stanford University is located in Stanford, California, which is in the San
      Francisco Bay Area, near Palo Alto. It''s in Northern California.


      University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) is located in Santa Barbara,
      California, which is on the coast, north of Los Angeles. Santa Barbara is in
      Southern California.


      When comparing north-south positions in California:

      - Northern California (where Stanford is) is north

      - Southern California (where UCSB is) is south


      So Stanford University is north of UCSB. This means Stanford is NOT south of
      UCSB.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative north-south
      positions of both universities in California.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Stanford University.

      Stanford University is located in Stanford, CA, which is in the San Francisco
      Bay Area (specifically near Palo Alto). This places it in Northern California.


      Step 2: Identify the location of UC Santa Barbara.

      University of California, Santa Barbara is located in Santa Barbara, CA, which
      is along the central California coast, northwest of Los Angeles.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      On a map of California, Stanford University (near San Francisco) is further
      north than UC Santa Barbara. Santa Barbara is located in what''s sometimes called
      the Central Coast region, while Stanford is definitively in Northern California.

      - North Carolina is in the southeastern United States

      - On a map of the US, North Carolina is positioned south of Pennsylvania


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since North Carolina is south of Pennsylvania, Duke University (in North Carolina)
      is south of the University of Pennsylvania (in Pennsylvania)

      - This means UPenn is NORTH of Duke, not south of it

      to determine the relative locations of Cornell University College of Veterinary
      Medicine in NY and the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia
      University in NY.


      Let me first identify where each school is located:


      1. Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine is located in Ithaca, NY,
      which is in the central/upstate region of New York State.


      2. The School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) at Columbia University
      is located in Manhattan, New York City, which is in the southeastern part of
      New York State.


      Now I need to determine if Cornell''s Veterinary Medicine College is south of
      Columbia''s SIPA.


      Looking at the geography of New York State:

      - Ithaca is significantly north and west of New York City

      - New York City (Manhattan) is located in the southeastern part of the state

      - Generally speaking, Ithaca is north of NYC, not south of it


      So Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca is located NORTH
      of the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University in
      NYC.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both institutions.

      - Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine is located in Ithaca, NY

      - School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) at Columbia University is
      located in Manhattan, New York City, NY


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions within New York State.

      - Ithaca is in the central/upstate region of New York State

      - Manhattan (NYC) is in the southeastern part of New York State


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positioning.

      - Ithaca is approximately 200 miles northwest of New York City

      - Looking at a map of New York State, Ithaca is clearly north of NYC


      Since Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine (in Ithaca) is positioned
      north of Columbia''s School of International and Public Affairs (in NYC), not
      south of it:
