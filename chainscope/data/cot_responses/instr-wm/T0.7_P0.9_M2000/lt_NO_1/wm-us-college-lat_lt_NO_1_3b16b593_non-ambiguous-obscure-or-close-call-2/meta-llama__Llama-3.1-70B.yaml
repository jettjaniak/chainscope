      geographic locations.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Boston University is located in Massachusetts,
      while Duke University is located in North Carolina.

      2. **General geographic locations**: Massachusetts is located in the Northeastern
      United States, while North Carolina is located in the Southeastern United States.

      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Generally, the Northeast (where Massachusetts

      the northeastern United States, while Virginia is in the southeastern part of
      the country.

      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Generally, the farther north a location is, the

      a higher latitude.

      4. **Conclusion based on latitude**: Since Massachusetts is north of Virginia,
      MIT is located north of UVA. This means that MIT is not located south of UVA.

      and the University of Texas at Austin is in Austin, Texas.

      2. **General geographic location of the states**: Illinois is in the northern
      United States, specifically in the Midwest region. Texas is in the southern
      United States, specifically in the South Central region.

      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Generally, the farther south a location is, the
      lower its latitude. Since Texas is south of Illinois, any institution in Texas,
      including the University of Texas at Austin College of Liberal Arts, would have
      a lower latitude than any institution in Illinois, such as Northwestern University.

      4. **Conclusion based on latitude**: Since Texas is south of Illinois, the University
      of Texas at Austin College of Liberal Arts is south of Northwestern University.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'

      let''s analyze the locations step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) is located
      in Pennsylvania, and Graduate School of Duke University is located in North
      Carolina.

      2. **Determine the general geographic positions of the states**: Pennsylvania
      is located in the Northeastern United States, while North Carolina is in the
      Southeastern United States.

      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Generally, the Northeast (where Pennsylvania is
      located) is north of the Southeast (where North Carolina is located) in the
      United States. This implies that Pennsylvania is typically at a higher latitude
      than North Carolina.

      4. **Conclusion based on geographical knowledge**: Since UPenn (in Pennsylvania)
      is at a higher latitude (more to the north) than the Graduate School of Duke
      University (in North Carolina), it is not located south of Duke University.


      Given these steps, the answer to whether UPenn, PA is located south of the Graduate
