      - University of Michigan is located in Ann Arbor, Michigan

      - Michigan is in the northern part of the United States, specifically in the
      Midwest region


      2. Next, locate University of Georgia:

      - University of Georgia is located in Athens, Georgia

      - Georgia is in the southeastern part of the United States


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Michigan is north of Georgia

      - This means that the University of Michigan (in Michigan) is NORTH of the University
      of Georgia (in Georgia)


      4. The question asks: "Is University of Michigan College of Engineering, MI
