      County, FL is located north of Nassau County, NY.


      Let me think about this geographically:


      1. Broward County is in Florida (FL). Florida is a state in the southeastern
      United States.

      2. Nassau County is in New York (NY). New York is a state in the northeastern
      United States.


      In the United States, states that are further south have lower latitudes than
      states that are further north. Florida is one of the southernmost states in
      the continental US, while New York is in the northern part of the country.


      Florida is definitely south of New York on a map of the United States. Since
      Broward County is in Florida and Nassau County is in New York, it follows that
      Broward County is south of Nassau County, not north of it.


      So the answer is NO, Broward County, FL is not located north of Nassau County,
      NY. It''s actually located south of Nassau County, NY.</think>To answer this
      question, I need to determine the geographic positions of both counties.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the states.

      - Florida (FL) is located in the southeastern United States.

      - New York (NY) is located in the northeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      - Florida is significantly south of New York on the map of the United States.


      Step 3: Look at the specific counties.

      - Broward County is in southern Florida (where Fort Lauderdale is located).

      - Nassau County is on Long Island in New York.


      Step 4: Compare their latitudes.

      - Since Broward County is in Florida, which is entirely south of New York state,
      Broward County must be south of Nassau County.


      NO, Broward County, FL is not located north of Nassau County, NY. It is located
      south of it.'

      First, let me identify where these counties are:

      - Harris County, TX: This is the county that contains Houston, Texas.

      - Cook County, IL: This is the county that contains Chicago, Illinois.


      Now, to determine which is further north, I need to compare their latitudes.


      Illinois is a northern state in the Midwest, while Texas is a southern state.
      Based on the general geography of the United States, Illinois is north of Texas.


      More specifically:

      - Chicago (in Cook County, IL) is located in the northern part of Illinois,
      near Lake Michigan.

      - Houston (in Harris County, TX) is located in the southeastern part of Texas,
      not far from the Gulf of Mexico.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - Texas is in the South/Southwest region of the United States.

      - On a map of the US, Illinois is clearly north of Texas.


      Step 3: Compare approximate latitudes.

      - Cook County, IL is approximately around 41-42 degrees North latitude.

      - Harris County, TX is approximately around 29-30 degrees North latitude.


      Since Cook County has a higher latitude than Harris County, Cook County is further
