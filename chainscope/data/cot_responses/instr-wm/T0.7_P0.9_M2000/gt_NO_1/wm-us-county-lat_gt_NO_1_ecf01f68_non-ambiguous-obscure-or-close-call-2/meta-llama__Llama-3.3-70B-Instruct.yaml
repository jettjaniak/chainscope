      by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Palm Beach County is in Florida, and New York
      County is in New York.

      2. **General geographic knowledge**: Florida is generally located in the southeastern
      part of the United States, while New York is in the northeastern part.

      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Without needing the exact latitudes, it''s known
      that Florida is south of New York due to its position on the map relative to
      the rest of the country.

      4. **Conclusion based on geography**: Since Florida is south of New York, any
      county in Florida, including Palm Beach County, would be south of any county

      2. **General geographical knowledge**: Florida is generally known to be located
      in the southeastern part of the United States, while New York is in the northeastern
      part.

      3. **Relative positions**: Given their states'' positions, Florida is south

      4. **County specifics**: Palm Beach County, being in southern Florida, would
      be even farther south compared to the general location of New York.

      5. **New York County specifics**: New York County, also known as Manhattan,
      is one of the southernmost counties in New York State.
