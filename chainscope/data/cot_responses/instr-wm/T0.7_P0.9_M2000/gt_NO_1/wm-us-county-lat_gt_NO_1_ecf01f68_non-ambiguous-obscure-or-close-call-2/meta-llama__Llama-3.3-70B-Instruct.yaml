      New York, is on Long Island, directly east of New York City, and is clearly
      in the northern part of the eastern United States compared to Florida.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Florida (and by extension, Broward County) is
      south of New York (and by extension, Nassau County), it is clear that Broward
      County, FL, is not located north of Nassau County, NY.


      The answer is: **NO**'
