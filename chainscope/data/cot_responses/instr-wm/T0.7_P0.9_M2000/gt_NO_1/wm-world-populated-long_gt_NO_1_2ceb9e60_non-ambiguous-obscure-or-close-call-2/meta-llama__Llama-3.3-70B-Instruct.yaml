      \ located east of the Urban Agglomeration of Montreal, let's break down the\
      \ steps:\n\n1. **Identify the location of Tahiti**: Tahiti is an island in French\
      \ Polynesia, which is in the Pacific Ocean. Specifically, it is part of the\
      \ Society Islands archipelago.\n\n2. **Identify the location of the Urban Agglomeration\
      \ of Montreal**: The Urban Agglomeration of Montreal refers to the metropolitan\
      \ area of Montreal, which is a city located in the province of Quebec, Canada.\
      \ Montreal is situated on the Island of Montreal, at the confluence of the Saint\
      \ Lawrence and Ottawa rivers.\n\n3. **Determine the geographical positions**:\n\
      \   - **Tahiti** is in the Pacific Ocean, and its geographical coordinates are\
      \ approximately 17.5\xB0 S latitude and 149.5\xB0 W longitude.\n   - **Montreal**\

      1. **Identify the locations**: The Upper East Side is a neighborhood in Manhattan,
      New York City. Inner London refers to the central part of London, England.


      2. **Understand the geography**: New York City is located in the United States
      of America, while London is in the United Kingdom. These are two separate countries
      with distinct geographical locations.


      3. **Consider the directional relationship**: The question asks if the Upper

      global or at least transatlantic perspective. The Upper East Side, being in
      New York, is generally west of London due to the United States being west of
      the United Kingdom when viewed on a world map.

      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations mentioned.
      The Upper East Side is a neighborhood in Manhattan, New York City, USA. Inner
      London refers to the central part of London, England, UK.


      2. **Understand Geographic Terms**: The term "east" in geographic locations
      usually refers to a direction or a position relative to another location. For
      the Upper East Side, "east" indicates its position relative to the rest of Manhattan.


      3. **Compare Locations**: The Upper East Side is in New York City, on the East
      Coast of the United States. Inner London is in the United Kingdom, which is
      across the Atlantic Ocean from New York City.


      4. **Consider Global Positioning**: Since the Upper East Side and Inner London
      are in different countries separated by a large body of water, their relative
      east-west positioning is not directly comparable in a simple manner without
      considering their global context.


      5. **Final Analysis**: Given that the Upper East Side is in the United States
      and Inner London is in the UK, and considering the Atlantic Ocean separates
      these two locations, the concept of "east" becomes complex when comparing two
      locations on different continents. However, if we consider the geographical
      layout and the fact that London is generally east of New York City when looking
      at a world map, the question seems to ask for a comparison of their longitudinal
      positions rather than their local, relative positions.

      \ locations have longitudes that are west of the Prime Meridian (0\xB0), but\
      \ to determine which is east of the other, we compare their longitudes.\n  \
      \ - Manhattan: 74.0060\xB0 W\n   - Rio de Janeiro: 43.1729\xB0 W\n   - Since\
      \ Rio de Janeiro is at 43.1729\xB0 W, which is less west (or more east) than\
      \ Manhattan's 74.0060\xB0 W, Rio de Janeiro is actually east of Manhattan.\n\

      Governorate is located east of Bangkok, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the location of Gaza Governorate**: Gaza Governorate is located
      in the Palestinian territories, which are in the Middle East. Specifically,
      it is situated on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea.


      2. **Identify the location of Bangkok**: Bangkok is the capital city of Thailand,
      which is in Southeast Asia.


      3. **Determine the general geographical direction from Bangkok**: To find out
      if Gaza Governorate is east of Bangkok, we need to consider the geographical
      layout. Generally, from Southeast Asia (where Bangkok is located), moving westward
      would take you through the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, and then into
      Africa or Europe, depending on the latitude.


      4. **Compare the locations**: Gaza Governorate is in the Middle East, which
      is west of Southeast Asia (where Bangkok is located). Therefore, from Bangkok''s
      perspective, moving west would eventually lead to the Middle East, where Gaza
      Governorate is situated.


      Based on these steps, Gaza Governorate is not east of Bangkok but rather west
      of it.

      \ but a well-known one is in Italy, and there are also places named Verona in\
      \ the United States, such as Verona, New Jersey, or Verona, Wisconsin.\n\n2.\
      \ **Determine the geographical context**: Since South Beach is in Florida, we\
      \ need to establish the geographical relationship between Florida and the potential\
      \ locations of Verona. \n\n3. **Consider Verona, Italy**: Italy is located in\
      \ Europe, and Florida is in North America. The entirety of North America is\
      \ west of Europe, so if we consider Verona, Italy, South Beach would indeed\
      \ be west of it, not east.\n\n4. **Consider Verona in the United States (e.g.,\
      \ Verona, New Jersey)**: New Jersey is on the East Coast of the United States,\
      \ and Florida is also on the East Coast but is located to the south. The question\
      \ of east-west positioning between these two locations depends on their specific\
      \ longitudes. Florida extends further east than New Jersey does, but since they\
      \ are both on the East Coast and relatively close in longitude, the difference\
      \ is not vast. However, considering the layout of the United States, South Beach,\

      \ Verona, Italy, South Beach is west of Verona. If we're comparing it to a Verona\
      \ in the United States like Verona, New Jersey, South Beach is more southeast.\
      \ Therefore, in neither case is South Beach directly east of Verona in a way\
      \ that would make the answer a straightforward \"yes\" without considering the\
      \ specific Verona in question. However, since the question asks for a simple\
      \ \"yes\" or \"no\" and considering the most direct interpretation might involve\
      \ comparing to a U.S. Verona (given the U.S. context of South Beach), the answer\

      \ Verona but rather southeast.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{No}$"

      is located east of Suez, let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Identify the location of Normandy**: Normandy is a region in northern France,
      known for its historical significance, especially during World War II. It faces
      the English Channel to the north.


      2. **Identify the location of Suez**: The Suez Canal is located in Egypt, connecting
      the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea through the Isthmus of Suez. It is a crucial
      shipping route that allows vessels to travel between Europe and Asia without
      having to circumnavigate Africa.


      3. **Determine the geographical relationship**: To decide if Normandy is east
      of Suez, we need to understand the global geography. France, where Normandy
      is located, is in Western Europe. Egypt, where the Suez Canal is, is in Northeastern
      Africa.


      4. **Compare longitudes**: Generally, places to the east have a higher longitude
      (up to 180 degrees East) compared to places to the west (which have lower longitudes,
      down to 180 degrees West). Normandy''s longitude is approximately 0 to 1 degree
      East (depending on the specific location within Normandy), while the Suez Canal''s
      longitude is around 32 degrees East.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Normandy is at a lower longitude than the Suez
      Canal, it means Normandy is west of the Suez Canal, not east.

      let''s break down the locations and their geographical positions:


      1. **Greater Boston** is a metropolitan area located in the state of Massachusetts,
      on the East Coast of the United States. Massachusetts is in the northeastern
      part of the United States.


      2. **Transylvania** is a historical and geographical region in Central Europe,
      specifically located in Romania. It is known for its diverse landscapes and
      cultural heritage.


      Given these locations, we need to compare their longitudinal positions (east-west
      positioning) on the globe:


      - The East Coast of the United States, where Greater Boston is located, is in
      the Western Hemisphere.

      - Transylvania, being in Romania, is in the Eastern Hemisphere.


      Since the Western Hemisphere is west of the Eastern Hemisphere, any location
      in the Western Hemisphere (like Greater Boston) is west of locations in the

      \ let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the locations**: Copenhagen\
      \ is the capital of Denmark, and Greater Cairo refers to the larger metropolitan\
      \ area of Cairo, the capital of Egypt.\n\n2. **Determine their general geographical\
      \ positions**:\n   - Copenhagen is in Europe, specifically in the northern part\
      \ of the continent.\n   - Greater Cairo is in Africa, located in the northeastern\
      \ part of the continent.\n\n3. **Compare their longitudes to determine east-west\
      \ positioning**:\n   - Copenhagen's longitude is approximately 12.57\xB0E.\n\
      \   - Greater Cairo's longitude is approximately 31.25\xB0E.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\
      \ Since Copenhagen is at 12.57\xB0E and Greater Cairo is at 31.25\xB0E, Copenhagen\
      \ is west of Greater Cairo because it has a lower longitude value.\n\nTherefore,\
