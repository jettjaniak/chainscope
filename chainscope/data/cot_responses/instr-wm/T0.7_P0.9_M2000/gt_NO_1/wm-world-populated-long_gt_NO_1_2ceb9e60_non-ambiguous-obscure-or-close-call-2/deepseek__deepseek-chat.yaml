      \ by step to determine whether Ireland is located east of Mumbai.\n\n### Step\
      \ 1: Understanding the Locations\n\nFirst, I need to know where both Ireland\
      \ and Mumbai are located on the globe.\n\n- **Ireland**: This is an island country\
      \ located in Northwestern Europe. It's situated to the west of Great Britain\
      \ and is part of the British Isles. Its capital is Dublin.\n\n- **Mumbai**:\
      \ This is a major city in India, located on the western coast of the Indian\
      \ subcontinent. It's the capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra and is known\
      \ as the financial and entertainment hub of India.\n\n### Step 2: Determining\
      \ the Longitudes\n\nTo find out which is east of the other, we need to look\
      \ at their longitudes. Longitude measures how far east or west a location is\
      \ from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0 longitude).\n\n- **Ireland's Longitude**: Ireland\
      \ is located at approximately 8\xB0 West longitude. This means it's west of\
      \ the Prime Meridian.\n\n- **Mumbai's Longitude**: Mumbai is located at approximately\
      \ 72\xB0 East longitude. This means it's east of the Prime Meridian.\n\n###\
      \ Step 3: Comparing the Longitudes\n\nNow, let's compare these longitudes:\n\
      \n- Ireland: 8\xB0 West\n- Mumbai: 72\xB0 East\n\nSince Ireland is west of the\
      \ Prime Meridian and Mumbai is east of it, we need to see the total degrees\
      \ between them.\n\nTo find the difference:\n\n8\xB0 West to 0\xB0 (Prime Meridian)\
      \ = 8\xB0\n\n0\xB0 to 72\xB0 East = 72\xB0\n\nTotal difference = 8\xB0 + 72\xB0\
      \ = 80\xB0\n\nThis means Mumbai is 80\xB0 east of Ireland.\n\n### Step 4: Understanding\
      \ East and West Directions\n\nIn terms of direction:\n\n- If you move from a\
      \ location with a lower longitude (like Ireland at 8\xB0 West) to a location\
      \ with a higher longitude (like Mumbai at 72\xB0 East), you're moving eastward.\n\
      \nTherefore, Mumbai is east of Ireland.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBased on\
      \ the above reasoning:\n\n- Ireland is located west of the Prime Meridian.\n\
      - Mumbai is located east of the Prime Meridian.\n- Mumbai is further east than\
      \ Ireland.\n\n**Final Answer: NO, Ireland is not located east of Mumbai; it\
      \ is located west of Mumbai.**"

      \ USA. It's on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific Ocean.\n\
      \n- **Punta Cana**: This is a resort town located in the easternmost region\
      \ of the Dominican Republic, which is an island nation in the Caribbean Sea.\n\
      \n### Step 2: Identifying the Longitudes\nTo determine if one location is east\
      \ or west of another, we need to look at their longitudes.\n\n- **Longitude\
      \ of Los Angeles County, California**: Approximately 118.2437\xB0 W.\n\n- **Longitude\
      \ of Punta Cana**: Approximately 68.4044\xB0 W.\n\nWait a minute, both are in\
      \ the Western Hemisphere, but their longitudes are different. Zero degrees longitude\
      \ is the Prime Meridian in Greenwich, England. Moving east from there, longitudes\
      \ increase up to 180\xB0 E, and moving west, they increase up to 180\xB0 W.\n\
      \n### Step 3: Comparing the Longitudes\nLet's compare the longitudes:\n\n- Los\
      \ Angeles: 118.2437\xB0 W\n- Punta Cana: 68.4044\xB0 W\n\nIn the Western Hemisphere,\
      \ the closer the longitude is to 0\xB0, the further east it is. Conversely,\
      \ the further the longitude is from 0\xB0, the further west it is.\n\nHere,\
      \ 68.4044\xB0 W is closer to 0\xB0 than 118.2437\xB0 W. Therefore, Punta Cana\
      \ is further east than Los Angeles.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nSince Punta Cana\
      \ is further east than Los Angeles, it means that Los Angeles is located west\
      \ of Punta Cana.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n**NO, Los Angeles\
      \ County, California is not located east of Punta Cana. It is located west of\
      \ Punta Cana.**"

      \ by step. The question is: **Is Manhattan located east of Rio de Janeiro?**\n\
      \n### Step 1: Understanding the Locations\n\nFirst, I need to know where Manhattan\
      \ and Rio de Janeiro are located geographically.\n\n- **Manhattan**: This is\
      \ one of the boroughs of New York City, located in the northeastern part of\
      \ the United States.\n- **Rio de Janeiro**: This is a major city in Brazil,\
      \ situated in the southeastern part of the country.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying\
      \ the Continents\n\nNext, let's identify the continents these cities are on.\n\
      \n- **Manhattan**: North America\n- **Rio de Janeiro**: South America\n\n###\
      \ Step 3: Visualizing Their Positions on the Globe\n\nTo determine if Manhattan\
      \ is east of Rio de Janeiro, I need to visualize their positions relative to\
      \ each other on the globe.\n\n- **North America** is to the north of South America.\n\
      - The eastern part of North America (where Manhattan is) is generally to the\
      \ west of the eastern part of South America (where Rio de Janeiro is).\n\nWait,\
      \ that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify.\n\n### Step 4: Looking\
      \ at Longitude Coordinates\n\nLongitude measures how far east or west a location\
      \ is from the Prime Meridian (0 degrees longitude). Positive longitudes are\
      \ east of the Prime Meridian, and negative longitudes are west.\n\nLet's find\
      \ the longitude for both cities:\n\n- **Manhattan, New York**: Approximately\
      \ 74 degrees West longitude.\n- **Rio de Janeiro, Brazil**: Approximately 43\
      \ degrees West longitude.\n\n### Step 5: Comparing the Longitudes\n\nNow, let's\
      \ compare these longitudes.\n\n- **Manhattan**: 74\xB0 W\n- **Rio de Janeiro**:\
      \ 43\xB0 W\n\nIn terms of longitude:\n\n- The higher the degree west, the further\
      \ west the location is.\nTherefore, 74\xB0 W is further west than 43\xB0 W.\n\
      \n### Step 6: Determining East or West Position\n\nSince Manhattan has a higher\
      \ degree west (74\xB0 W) compared to Rio de Janeiro's 43\xB0 W, Manhattan is\
      \ located **west** of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the longitude\
      \ coordinates:\n\n- Manhattan is at 74\xB0 W.\n- Rio de Janeiro is at 43\xB0\
      \ W.\n\nSince 74\xB0 W is further west than 43\xB0 W, **Manhattan is located\

      \ around 4 to 7 degrees east longitude.\n\n### Step 2: Locate Easter Island\
      \ on the Map\n\nNext, I need to find the location of Easter Island. Easter Island\
      \ is a remote volcanic island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. It's famous\
      \ for its massive stone statues called Moai.\n\n- **Longitude of Easter Island:**\
      \ Easter Island is located at approximately 109 degrees west longitude. This\
      \ places it in the western hemisphere, significantly west of the prime meridian.\n\
      \n### Step 3: Understand the Concept of \"East of\"\n\nTo determine if Easter\
      \ Island is east of Holland, I need to compare their longitudes.\n\n- **Longitude\
      \ Basics:** Longitude lines run from the North Pole to the South Pole, with\
      \ the prime meridian at 0 degrees. Moving east from the prime meridian, longitudes\
      \ increase up to 180 degrees east. Moving west, longitudes increase up to 180\
      \ degrees west.\n\n- **Comparing Longitudes:** Holland is at around 4 to 7 degrees\
      \ east longitude, while Easter Island is at about 109 degrees west longitude.\n\
      \n### Step 4: Visualizing the Positions on a Map\n\nTo better understand, let's\
      \ imagine the Earth as a globe:\n\n1. **Holland:** Located in Northwestern Europe,\
      \ slightly east of the prime meridian.\n2. **Easter Island:** Located in the\
      \ southeastern Pacific Ocean, west of the prime meridian.\n\nSince Easter Island\
      \ is at 109 degrees west longitude, it's in the western hemisphere, whereas\
      \ Holland is in the eastern hemisphere.\n\n### Step 5: Determining Relative\
      \ Position\n\nNow, to ascertain if Easter Island is east of Holland:\n\n- **East\
      \ of Holland:** Any location with a longitude greater than Holland's (i.e.,\
      \ further east) would be east of Holland.\n  \n- **Easter Island's Longitude:**\
      \ 109 degrees west is equivalent to -109 degrees east. Since -109 degrees is\
      \ less than 4 to 7 degrees east, Easter Island is actually west of Holland.\n\
      \n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\nBased on the longitude comparison:\n\n- Holland:\
      \ ~4 to 7 degrees east longitude.\n- Easter Island: ~109 degrees west longitude\
      \ (-109 degrees east).\n\nSince -109 degrees east is less than 4 to 7 degrees\
      \ east, Easter Island lies to the west of Holland, not to the east.\n\n**Final\
      \ Answer:** NO, Easter Island is not located east of Holland."

      \ South Beach located east of Verona?** To answer this, I'll break it down into\
      \ manageable steps.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\nFirst, I need to\
      \ know where South Beach and Verona are located.\n\n- **South Beach**: This\
      \ is a neighborhood in Miami Beach, Florida, USA. It's known for its beaches,\
      \ art deco architecture, and vibrant nightlife.\n  \n- **Verona**: This is a\
      \ city in northern Italy. It's famous for its Roman amphitheater, the setting\
      \ of Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet,\" and its well-preserved medieval city\
      \ center.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Their Geographical Positions\n\nNext, I need\
      \ to figure out the geographical coordinates or general positions of these two\
      \ places.\n\n- **South Beach, Florida**: Located in the southeastern part of\
      \ the United States, specifically in the state of Florida. Florida is on the\
      \ eastern coast of the U.S., bordering the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n- **Verona, Italy**:\
      \ Situated in the northern part of Italy, in the Veneto region. Italy is in\
      \ southern Europe, bordering the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n### Step 3: Understand\
      \ the Concept of \"East\"\n\nTo determine if South Beach is east of Verona,\
      \ I need to understand the relative eastward positioning between the two locations.\n\
      \n### Step 4: Compare Longitudes\n\nGenerally, locations with higher longitude\
      \ values are considered to be further east. However, since the Earth is a sphere,\
      \ we need to consider the direction of longitude lines.\n\n- **South Beach,\
      \ Florida**: Roughly at a longitude of around 80 degrees West.\n  \n- **Verona,\
      \ Italy**: Roughly at a longitude of around 11 degrees East.\n\n### Step 5:\
      \ Analyze the Difference\n\nNow, let's compare these longitudes:\n\n- South\
      \ Beach is at 80 degrees West.\n- Verona is at 11 degrees East.\n\nTo find the\
      \ difference, we can add the absolute values since they are on opposite sides\
      \ of the Prime Meridian (0 degrees longitude):\n\n80 (West) + 11 (East) = 91\
      \ degrees.\n\nThis means that South Beach and Verona are 91 degrees apart in\
      \ longitude.\n\n### Step 6: Determine Eastward Positioning\n\nSince Verona is\
      \ at 11 degrees East and South Beach is at 80 degrees West, Verona is further\
      \ east than South Beach.\n\nBut the question is: **Is South Beach located east\
      \ of Verona?**\n\nGiven that South Beach is at 80 degrees West and Verona is\
      \ at 11 degrees East, South Beach is actually to the west of Verona.\n\n###\
      \ Step 7: Conclusion\n\nBased on the above analysis, South Beach is not located\
      \ east of Verona; rather, it is to the west.\n\n**Answer: NO**"
