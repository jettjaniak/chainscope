      1. San Juan, Puerto Rico is located at approximately 66.1 degrees west longitude.

      2. Monte Carlo, Monaco is located at approximately 7.4 degrees east longitude.


      Since 66.1 degrees west is numerically less than 7.4 degrees east when considering

      Carlo.


      Therefore, the answer is NO. San Juan, Puerto Rico is not located east of Monte
