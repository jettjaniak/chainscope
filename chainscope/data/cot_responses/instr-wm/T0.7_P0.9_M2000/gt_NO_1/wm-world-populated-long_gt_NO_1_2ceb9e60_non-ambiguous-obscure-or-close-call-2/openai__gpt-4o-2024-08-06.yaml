      of the United States.


      2. **Identify the general flow and location of the River Nile**: The River Nile
      flows primarily through northeastern Africa. It runs through countries such
      as Uganda, Sudan, and Egypt, eventually emptying into the Mediterranean Sea.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: The River Nile is in the Eastern Hemisphere,
      specifically in northeastern Africa. The United States, where Coney Island is
      located, is in the Western Hemisphere, specifically in North America.


      4. **Compare their longitudinal positions**: Coney Island, located in New York,
