      \   - Montreal's longitude is approximately 73\xB0 W (west of the prime meridian).\n\
      \n4. **Compare their longitudes**:\n   - Since Tahiti's longitude is farther\

      Florida, United States. Verona is a city in the Veneto region of northern Italy.


      2. **Determine their general locations**: South Beach is in North America, specifically
      in the United States. Verona is in Europe, specifically in Italy.


      3. **Consider the geographical positions**: Generally, Europe is east of North
      America. This means that locations in Europe are east of locations in North
