      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both places.

      - Great Britain is an island in northwestern Europe, containing England, Scotland,
      and Wales.

      - Capri is a small island located in the Bay of Naples, off the western coast
      of southern Italy.

      Great Britain is an island in northwestern Europe, consisting of England, Scotland,
      and Wales. It''s located in the North Atlantic Ocean, west of continental Europe.

      Italy is in southern Europe, east of Spain and France. Great Britain is northwest
      of continental Europe. When comparing longitudinal positions, Great Britain
      is located to the west of Italy, and therefore to the west of Capri.
