    02e44597-c372-4145-a4b6-77adb4f94786: '1. **Tahiti''s Location:**
      Tahiti is in the South Pacific Ocean, part of French Polynesia.  It''s generally
      considered to be in the western hemisphere, but far west.


      2. **Montreal''s Location:** Montreal is in eastern Canada, in the western hemisphere.


      3. **East vs. West:**  "East" refers to higher degrees of longitude.  Since
      both are in the western hemisphere, we need to determine which has the higher
      longitude WEST.  Tahiti, being much further west, will have a much higher longitude
      WEST than Montreal.


      4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, Tahiti is located west of Montreal, not east.


      **NO**

    90891181-71c9-4b75-a59c-6b5ccc7eabab: '1. **San Antonio:** We need
      to determine which San Antonio is being referenced. The most well-known is San
      Antonio, Texas, USA.  There might be other less prominent places with the same
      name, but for this question, we will assume it''s the Texan city.


      2. **Australia, Cuba:** This is a bit of a trick.  There is no place called
      "Australia, Cuba".  Australia is a continent/country, and Cuba is an island
      nation in the Caribbean.  We need to consider them as separate locations.


      3. **East of Australia:** San Antonio, Texas is east of the continent of Australia.


      4. **East of Cuba:** San Antonio, Texas is also east of Cuba.


      5. **The Question:**  Since San Antonio, Texas is east of *both* Australia AND
      Cuba, the statement "San Antonio located east of Australia, Cuba" is true.


      **YES**

      Australia would be further west than Australia is.

      3. **Cuba:** Cuba is an island nation in the Caribbean, relatively close to
      the southeastern USA.


      Since San Antonio is in the USA and Australia is far to the west, San Antonio
      cannot be east of Australia.  The inclusion of Cuba in the phrase doesn''t change
      this fact.
