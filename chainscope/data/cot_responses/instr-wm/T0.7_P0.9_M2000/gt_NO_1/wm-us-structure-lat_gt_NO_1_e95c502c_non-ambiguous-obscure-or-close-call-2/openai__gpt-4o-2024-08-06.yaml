      in Maryland, we need to consider the geographic locations of both places:


      1. **The Beverly Hills Hotel** is located in Beverly Hills, California. Beverly
      Hills is in Southern California, which is generally at a latitude around 34
      degrees north.


      2. **The George Bush Center for Intelligence** is the headquarters of the CIA,
