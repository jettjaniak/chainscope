      \ then the answer is YES.\n- If Apple Park's latitude is lower (more south)\
      \ than the US Capitol's latitude, then the answer is NO.\n\nLet me think about\
      \ the general locations:\n- Washington DC is on the east coast of the US, roughly\
      \ at around 38-39\xB0 N latitude.\n- Cupertino, CA (where Apple Park is located)\
      \ is in the San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California, roughly at around\
      \ 37-38\xB0 N latitude.\n\nWhile Northern California is called \"Northern\"\
      , it's actually not that far north in terms of latitude compared to DC. In fact,\
      \ Washington DC is slightly north of the Bay Area in California.\n\nSo Apple\
      \ Park (in Cupertino, CA) should be slightly south of the United States Capitol\
      \ (in Washington, DC) in terms of latitude, not north of it.\n\nTherefore, my\
      \ answer should be NO.</think># Is Apple Park, CA located north of United States\
      \ Capitol, DC?\n\nTo answer this question, I need to compare the latitudes of\
      \ these two locations:\n\n1. Apple Park is located in Cupertino, California,\
      \ in the San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California.\n2. The United States\
      \ Capitol is located in Washington, DC, on the east coast.\n\nDespite \"Northern\
      \ California\" in its regional name, the San Francisco Bay Area (where Cupertino\
      \ is located) sits at approximately 37.3\xB0 N latitude.\n\nWashington DC is\
      \ located at approximately 38.9\xB0 N latitude.\n\nSince Washington DC has a\
      \ higher latitude than Cupertino, the US Capitol is actually north of Apple\
      \ Park, not the other way around.\n\nNO"
