      \ Washington, D.C. is at approximately 38.90\xB0N latitude.\n\n3. **Compare\
      \ the latitudes**:\n   - Since latitude measures how far north or south a place\
      \ is from the equator, a higher latitude indicates a location is more to the\
      \ north.\n   - Comparing the latitudes: 37.33\xB0N (Apple Park) is less than\
      \ 38.90\xB0N (United States Capitol).\n\nBased on these steps, Apple Park, CA\
      \ is located south of the United States Capitol, DC, because it has a lower\
