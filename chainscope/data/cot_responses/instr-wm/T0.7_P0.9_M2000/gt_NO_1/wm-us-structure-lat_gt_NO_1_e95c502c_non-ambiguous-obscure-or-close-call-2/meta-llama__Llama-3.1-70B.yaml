    26297e83-5b93-48eb-a340-ba6f225f0dec: '<think></think>To answer this question,
      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Lakewood Church is in Texas (TX), and the Hollywood
      Sign is in California (CA).


      2. **Understand the geography**: Texas is located in the southern part of the
      United States, while California is on the West Coast.


      3. **Consider the general positions**: Generally, Texas is east of California.


      4. **Apply to the specific locations**: Since Lakewood Church, TX, is in Texas,
      and the Hollywood Sign, CA, is in California, Lakewood Church would be east
      of the Hollywood Sign based on the states'' relative positions.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Texas is east of California, Lakewood Church,
      TX, is not north of the Hollywood Sign, CA.


      The answer is: NO
