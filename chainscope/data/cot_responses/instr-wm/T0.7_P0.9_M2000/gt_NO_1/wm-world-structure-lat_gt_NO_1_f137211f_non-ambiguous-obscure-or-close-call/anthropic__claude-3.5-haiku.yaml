      - London Victoria station is in London, United Kingdom

      - London is in the northern hemisphere

      - It is located in Europe


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Bora Bora is in the southern hemisphere

      - London Victoria station is in the northern hemisphere

      - Since Bora Bora is south of the equator and London is north of the equator,
      Bora Bora cannot be north of London Victoria station
