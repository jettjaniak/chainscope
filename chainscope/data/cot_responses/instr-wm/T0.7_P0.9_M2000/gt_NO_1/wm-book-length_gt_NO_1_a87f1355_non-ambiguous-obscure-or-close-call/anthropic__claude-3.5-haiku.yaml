      1. First, I''ll check the length of "Good Omens" by Neil Gaiman:

      - "Good Omens" was co-written with Terry Pratchett

      - The book is approximately 400-430 pages long


      2. Next, I''ll check the length of "The Dark Tower" by Stephen King:

      - "The Dark Tower" actually refers to a series of 7 books

      - The first book, "The Gunslinger", is around 300 pages

      - The entire series is much longer, totaling over 4,000 pages


      3. Comparing the lengths:

      - "Good Omens" is a single book around 400 pages

    f0c9f33c-67ed-4f04-8b18-bca64ba83a69: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll find the length of J.M. Coetzee''s "Disgrace":

      - "Disgrace" is approximately 220 pages long


      2. Next, I''ll find the length of Stephen King''s "The Dark Tower" (assuming
      this means the first book in the Dark Tower series):

      - The first Dark Tower book, "The Gunslinger", is around 224 pages

      - However, the entire Dark Tower series is much longer, spanning multiple books


      3. Comparing the lengths:

      - "Disgrace" is 220 pages

      - "The Gunslinger" is 224 pages

      - These are very close in length, with "The Gunslinger" being slightly longer


      4. Considering the question''s wording, I''ll interpret it as asking about the
      first Dark Tower book


      5. Conclusion: Since "The Gunslinger" is slightly longer than "Disgrace", the
