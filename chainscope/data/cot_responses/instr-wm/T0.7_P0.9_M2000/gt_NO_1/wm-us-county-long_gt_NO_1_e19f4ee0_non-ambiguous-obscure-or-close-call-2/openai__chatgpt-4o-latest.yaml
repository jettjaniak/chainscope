      \ Denver County is in the state of Colorado. The city of Denver is both the\
      \ city and the county.\n   - Kings County is in the state of New York. It is\
      \ coextensive with the borough of Brooklyn in New York City.\n\n2. **Determine\
      \ their approximate longitudes:**\n   - Denver, CO is located at approximately\
      \ 105\xB0 West longitude.\n   - Brooklyn, NY (Kings County) is located at approximately\
      \ 74\xB0 West longitude.\n\n3. **Understand how longitude works:**\n   - Longitude\
      \ lines measure how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0\
      \ longitude).\n   - The higher the number in degrees west, the further west\
      \ the location is.\n\n4. **Compare the two longitudes:**\n   - Denver is at\
      \ about 105\xB0 W.\n   - Brooklyn is at about 74\xB0 W.\n   - Since 105\xB0\
      \ W is further west than 74\xB0 W, Denver County is located west of Kings County.\n\
      \n**Final Answer: NO**. Denver County, CO is not located east of Kings County,\
      \ NY."
