      we need to consider the geographical locations of Harris County, TX, and Wayne
      County, MI. Let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Harris County, TX, is located in the state of
      Texas, which is in the southern part of the United States. Wayne County, MI,
      is located in the state of Michigan, which is in the northern part of the United
      States.


      2. **Understand the direction of "east"**: In the context of the United States,
      "east" refers to the direction towards the Atlantic Ocean, which is to the right
      when looking at a map with north at the top.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since Texas is to the west and south of Michigan,
      any point in Texas (such as Harris County) would generally be west and south
      of any point in Michigan (such as Wayne County).


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical locations of Harris County, TX,
      and Wayne County, MI, Harris County, TX, cannot be located east of Wayne County,
      MI.
