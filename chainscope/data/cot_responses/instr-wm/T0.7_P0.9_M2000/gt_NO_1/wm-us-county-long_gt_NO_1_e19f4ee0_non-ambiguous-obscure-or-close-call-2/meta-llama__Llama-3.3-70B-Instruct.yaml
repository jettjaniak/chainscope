      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Dallas County, TX, and Miami-Dade County, FL,
      are the two locations in question.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Dallas County is located in the state of Texas,
      which is in the south-central part of the United States. Miami-Dade County is
      located in the state of Florida, which is in the southeastern part of the United
      States.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Generally, Texas is considered to be
      west of Florida. This is because Texas is part of the Southwest and is located
      near the center of the U.S. when considering the country''s width from east
      to west, while Florida is in the Southeast and extends into the Atlantic Ocean
      on the eastern edge of the country.


      4. **Consider the specific locations**: Dallas, being in north Texas, is still
      west of Miami, which is in southern Florida. The distance between these two
      points from east to west places Dallas County to the west of Miami-Dade County.


      5. **Answer the question**: Given the above reasoning, Dallas County, TX, is
      not east of Miami-Dade County, FL.
