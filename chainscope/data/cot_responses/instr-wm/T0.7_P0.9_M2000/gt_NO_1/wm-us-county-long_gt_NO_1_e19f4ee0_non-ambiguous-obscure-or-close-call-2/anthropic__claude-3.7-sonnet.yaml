      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both counties.

      - Los Angeles County is in California, on the west coast of the United States.

      - Nassau County is in New York, on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on a map of the United States.

      - California is on the western side of the continental United States.

      - New York is on the eastern side of the continental United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Moving east on a map of the US means moving from California toward New York.

      - Moving west means moving from New York toward California.

      - Therefore, Los Angeles County is west of Nassau County, not east of it.


      NO, Los Angeles County, CA is not located east of Nassau County, NY. It is located
      west of Nassau County.'

      - California is on the Pacific coast, making it a western state.

      - New York is on the Atlantic coast, making it an eastern state.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Since Los Angeles County is in California (west coast), and Nassau County
      is in New York (east coast), Los Angeles County is located to the west of Nassau
      County.

      - This means Los Angeles County is NOT east of Nassau County.

      - California is a west coast state, while New York is an east coast state.

      - Generally, locations in California are west of locations in New York.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Los Angeles County is positioned near the Pacific Ocean on the west coast.

      - Nassau County is positioned near the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast.

      - The continental United States spans approximately 3,000 miles from east to

      - Fulton County is in Georgia, in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider their approximate longitudes.

      - California is on the west coast, so Sacramento County would be at a western
      longitude.

      - Georgia is in the southeast, much further east than California.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Moving from west to east across the United States, you would encounter California
      (and Sacramento County) before reaching Georgia (and Fulton County).

      - This means Sacramento County is west of Fulton County, not east of it.


      NO, Sacramento County, CA is not located east of Fulton County, GA. It is located
      west of Fulton County.'

      - Palm Beach County is in Florida (FL), which is on the east coast of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      - California is located on the west coast, so Napa County is in the western
      part of the US.

      - Florida is located on the east coast, so Palm Beach County is in the eastern
      part of the US.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Since Napa County is on the west coast and Palm Beach County is on the east
      coast, Napa County is west of Palm Beach County.

      - This means Palm Beach County is east of Napa County.


      Step 4: Answer the specific question asked.

      The question asks if Napa County is east of Palm Beach County, which would be
      the opposite of what I determined.


      NO, Napa County, CA is not located east of Palm Beach County, FL. It is located
      west of Palm Beach County.'

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both counties.

      - Denver County, CO is in Colorado, which is in the western part of the United
      States.

      - Kings County, NY (also known as Brooklyn) is in New York, which is on the
      eastern coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on a map.

      - Colorado is significantly west of New York state.

      - Denver County is in central/eastern Colorado.

      - Kings County (Brooklyn) is on the eastern edge of New York state.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Even though Denver is in the eastern part of Colorado, the entire state of
      Colorado is west of New York.

      - Therefore, Denver County must be west of Kings County, not east of it.


      NO, Denver County, CO is not located east of Kings County, NY. It is located
      west of Kings County.'

      - Denver County is in the central-eastern part of Colorado.

      - Kings County (Brooklyn) is on the western part of Long Island in New York.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - States on the east coast (like New York) are east of inland states (like Colorado).

      - Therefore, Denver County, CO is west of Kings County, NY.

      - This means Kings County, NY is east of Denver County, CO.
