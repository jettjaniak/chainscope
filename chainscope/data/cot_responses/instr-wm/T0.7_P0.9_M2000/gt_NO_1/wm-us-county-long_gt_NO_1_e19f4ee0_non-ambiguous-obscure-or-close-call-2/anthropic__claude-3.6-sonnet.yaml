      - Palm Beach County is in Florida, on the Atlantic coast


      2) To determine which is further east, I need to consider their relative positions:

      - Napa County, CA is on the west coast of the US

      - Palm Beach County, FL is on the east coast of the US


      3) Since Palm Beach County is on the east coast and Napa County is on the west
      coast:

      - Palm Beach County must be further east than Napa County

      - Therefore, Napa County cannot be east of Palm Beach County


      NO'
    d407d48f-0e3b-45a4-83ed-cd67b8d6c7e4: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let me recall the general locations:

      - Napa County is in California, in the northern part of the state near San Francisco

      - Palm Beach County is in Florida, on the Atlantic coast


      2) To determine which is further east, I can think about their relative positions:

      - Napa County is on the west coast of the US

      - Palm Beach County is on the east coast of the US


      3) Since the continental United States spans from west to east, and:

      - West coast locations are always west of east coast locations

      - Napa County is near the Pacific Ocean (west coast)

      - Palm Beach County is on the Atlantic Ocean (east coast)


      Therefore, Napa County must be WEST of Palm Beach County, not east.


      NO'

      2) When comparing east-west positions in the US:

      - California is on the west coast
