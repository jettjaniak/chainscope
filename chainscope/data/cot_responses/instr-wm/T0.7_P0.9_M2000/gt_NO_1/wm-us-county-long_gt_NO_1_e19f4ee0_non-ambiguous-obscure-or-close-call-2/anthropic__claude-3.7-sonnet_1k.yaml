      locations of Los Angeles County, CA and Nassau County, NY on an east-west axis.


      First, let me establish where each county is:

      1. Los Angeles County is in California, which is on the west coast of the United
      States.

      2. Nassau County is in New York, which is on the east coast of the United States.


      In terms of geographic coordinates:

      - California is located farther west than New York

      - The west coast is on the Pacific Ocean, while the east coast is on the Atlantic
      Ocean

      - When looking at a map of the United States, California is on the left (west)
      side, while New York is on the right (east) side


      Since Los Angeles County is in California (west) and Nassau County is in New
      York (east), Los Angeles County is located WEST of Nassau County, not east of
      it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Los Angeles County, CA is not located east of Nassau
      County, NY. It''s located west of Nassau County.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Los Angeles County is in California, on the west coast of the United States.

      - Nassau County is in New York, on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - California is significantly west of New York.

      - Los Angeles County is in southern California, while Nassau County is on Long
      Island in New York.

      - When looking at a U.S. map, California appears on the left (west) side, while
      New York appears on the right (east) side.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Going from west to east across the U.S., you would encounter Los Angeles County
      first, then Nassau County.

      - This means Los Angeles County is west of Nassau County, not east of it.


      NO, Los Angeles County, CA is not located east of Nassau County, NY.'

      - The west coast (including California) is on the western edge

      - The east coast (including New York) is on the eastern edge

      United States.

      - Nassau County is in New York, on the eastern (Atlantic) coast of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - The United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean
      (east).

      - California is on the west coast, while New York is on the east coast.

      - Moving from west to east across the US, you would travel from California to

      - The United States is generally arranged with western states (like Nevada)
      on the left side of the map and eastern states (like New York) on the right
      side.

      - Nevada is significantly west of New York on any US map.


      Step 3: Determine the directional relationship.

      - Since Nevada is west of New York, Clark County (NV) must be west of Richmond
      County (NY).

      - This means Richmond County (NY) is east of Clark County (NV), not the other

      - Since King County is in Washington, which is entirely west of Illinois, King
      County must be west of Cook County

      - To be east of something means to be located more toward the eastern direction

      step. The question is asking about the relative locations of two US counties:

      1. Harris County, TX (in Texas)

      2. Wayne County, MI (in Michigan)


      Specifically, I need to determine if Harris County, TX is located east of Wayne
      County, MI.


      To determine this, I need to think about the geographic locations of these counties:


      - Harris County, TX contains Houston and is located in southeastern Texas, near
      the Gulf of Mexico.

      - Wayne County, MI contains Detroit and is located in southeastern Michigan,

      Orleans Parish is east of Philadelphia County.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - Orleans Parish is in Louisiana (LA). It contains the city of New Orleans.

      - Philadelphia County is in Pennsylvania (PA). It contains the city of Philadelphia.


      Now, to determine their east-west relationship, I need to consider their longitudes:

      - Louisiana is in the southern part of the United States, in the Gulf Coast
      region.

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern part of the United States.


      Geographically, Pennsylvania is to the east of Louisiana on the US map. The
      United States generally runs with lower longitude numbers on the east coast
      and higher longitude numbers on the west coast.


      Since Orleans Parish is in Louisiana (western relative to Pennsylvania) and
      Philadelphia County is in Pennsylvania (eastern relative to Louisiana), Orleans
      Parish would be WEST of Philadelphia County, not east.


      So the answer would be NO, Orleans Parish, LA is not located east of Philadelphia
      County, PA. It''s located west of it.</think>I need to determine the relative

      - Louisiana is located in the southern United States along the Gulf of Mexico.

      - Pennsylvania is located in the northeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - The eastern United States has lower longitude values than the western parts.

      - Pennsylvania is significantly further east than Louisiana on the US map.

      - New Orleans (Orleans Parish) is west of Philadelphia (Philadelphia County).

      Santa Clara County is in California, which is on the west coast of the United
      States.

      Broward County is in Florida, which is on the east coast of the United States.


      In the United States, east and west are determined by longitude - eastern locations
      have higher longitude values than western locations.


      Since California is on the west coast and Florida is on the east coast, Santa
      Clara County (in California) must be west of Broward County (in Florida). This
      means Santa Clara County cannot be east of Broward County.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine the geographic positions of both counties.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Santa Clara County is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the
      United States.

      - Broward County is in Florida (FL), which is on the east coast of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic orientation of the United States.

      - In the continental US, locations on the west coast (like California) are generally
      west of locations on the east coast (like Florida).

      - This means California is west of Florida, not east of it.


      Step 3: Draw the conclusion about the specific counties.

      - Since Santa Clara County is in California (west) and Broward County is in
      Florida (east), Santa Clara County must be west of Broward County, not east
      of it.

      United States.

      2. Broward County is in Florida (FL), which is on the east coast of the United
      States.


      Since California is on the west coast and Florida is on the east coast, California
      is west of Florida. Therefore, Santa Clara County, CA is west of Broward County,
      FL (not east of it).


      So the answer would be NO, Santa Clara County is not located east of Broward
      County.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions
      of these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Santa Clara County is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the
      United States.

      - Broward County is in Florida (FL), which is on the east coast of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic orientation of the United States.

      - When looking at a map of the US, California is on the far west while Florida
      is on the far east.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Since California is west of Florida, Santa Clara County must be west of Broward
      County.

      - If Santa Clara County is west of Broward County, then it cannot be east of
      it.


      NO, Santa Clara County, CA is not located east of Broward County, FL.'

      United States

      - Broward County is in Florida (FL), which is on the east coast of the United
      States


      In terms of geography, the continental United States has:

      - West Coast (Pacific Ocean) - including California

      - East Coast (Atlantic Ocean) - including Florida


      Since California is on the west coast and Florida is on the east coast, Santa
      Clara County (in California) is generally west of Broward County (in Florida),
      not east of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO - Santa Clara County, CA is not located east of
      Broward County, FL. It''s actually located west of Broward County, FL.</think>I

      contiguous United States.

      - Florida is on the Atlantic coast, which forms the eastern boundary of the
      contiguous United States.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positioning.

      - Moving from west to east across the United States, you would go from California
      to Florida.

      - This means Santa Clara County is west of Broward County, not east of it.


      NO, Santa Clara County, CA is not located east of Broward County, FL. It is

      CA is located east of Broward County, FL, I need to think about the relative
      locations of these counties within the United States.


      First, let me identify where these counties are:

      - Santa Clara County is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the
      United States

      - Broward County is in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern United States


      In the United States, locations on the west coast (like California) are generally
      west of locations on the east coast (like Florida). This is because the continental
      United States spans from the Pacific Ocean on the west to the Atlantic Ocean
      on the east.


      California is significantly west of Florida. Santa Clara County in California
      would therefore be west of Broward County in Florida, not east of it.


      So, is Santa Clara County, CA located east of Broward County, FL? No, it''s
      actually located west of Broward County.</think># Is Santa Clara County, CA
      located east of Broward County, FL?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two counties.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Santa Clara County is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the
      United States

      - Broward County is in Florida (FL), which is on the east coast of the United
      States


      ## Step 2: Compare east-west positions

      The United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean
      (east). California is on the Pacific side, while Florida is on the Atlantic
      side.


      ## Step 3: Determine relative position

      California is substantially west of Florida on any US map. This means Santa
      Clara County must be west of Broward County, not east of it.


      Answer: NO'

      Step 1: Recall the locations of these counties.

      - Santa Clara County is in California, which is on the west coast of the United
      States.

      - Broward County is in Florida, which is on the southeast coast of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the east-west positioning.

      - California is generally west of Florida on a map of the United States.

      - The west coast (California) is to the west of the east coast (Florida).


      Step 3: Therefore, Santa Clara County, CA must be west of Broward County, FL,

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Santa Clara County is located in California (CA).

      - Broward County is located in Florida (FL).


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of California and Florida.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Florida is on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - States on the west coast (like California) are west of states on the east
      coast (like Florida).

      - Moving east from California, you would need to cross most of the continental
      United States to reach Florida.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since Santa Clara County is in California (west) and Broward County is in
      Florida (east), Santa Clara County is located to the west of Broward County,
      not to the east.


      NO'

      County, CA is located east of Bronx County, NY, I need to think about the geographic
      locations of these two counties in the United States.


      Step 1: Recall the general locations of these counties.

      San Francisco County is in California, which is on the west coast of the United
      States.

      Bronx County is in New York, which is on the east coast of the United States.

      Let me recall:

      - Sacramento County is in California, which is on the west coast of the United
      States

      - Fulton County is in Georgia, which is in the southeastern United States


      In terms of US geography:

      - West coast states like California are generally west of southeastern states
      like Georgia

      - West corresponds to higher longitude values (with negative values in the Western
      Hemisphere)

      - East corresponds to lower longitude values (less negative in the Western Hemisphere)


      Sacramento County would be further west (higher negative longitude) than Fulton
      County, which would be more east (lower negative longitude).


      Therefore, Sacramento County, CA would NOT be east of Fulton County, GA. It
      would be WEST of Fulton County, GA.</think>I need to determine the relative
      positions of Sacramento County, CA and Fulton County, GA in terms of east-west

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Sacramento County is in California, which is on the west coast of the United
      States.

      - Fulton County is in Georgia, which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the United States.

      - California is significantly west of Georgia on the US map.

      - The west coast (California) is generally west of all southeastern states (including
      Georgia).


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Sacramento County, being in California, is located on the western side of
      the country.

      - Fulton County, being in Georgia, is located in the eastern portion of the
      country.


      Step 4: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - When comparing east-west positions, Sacramento County is west of Fulton County,
      not east of it.

      to the Atlantic Ocean (east).

      - California is on the western side of the country.

      - Georgia is on the eastern side of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Since California is on the west coast and Georgia is in the southeast, Sacramento

      To do this, I''ll consider the general geographic locations:


      1. Dallas County is in Texas, which is in the south-central part of the United
      States.

      2. Miami-Dade County is in Florida, which is in the southeastern United States.


      Specifically:

      - Dallas, TX is roughly in the eastern half of Texas

      - Miami is at the southeastern tip of Florida, which itself is the southeasternmost
      state in the continental US


      Looking at US geography, Florida extends much further east than Texas. In fact,
      almost the entire state of Florida is east of Texas.


      Miami-Dade County is on the Atlantic coast of Florida, placing it at one of
      the easternmost points in the United States.


      Dallas County is nowhere near the eastern edge of the continental US, and is
      considerably west of Florida.


      Therefore, Dallas County, TX is NOT east of Miami-Dade County, FL. It is west
      of Miami-Dade County.</think>To determine if Dallas County, TX is located east

      - Miami-Dade County is in Florida, which is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 2: Consider their positions on a west-to-east axis.

      - Texas is located west of Florida in the United States.

      - Dallas County is in the northeastern part of Texas.

      - Miami-Dade County is on the Atlantic coast of Florida, at the southeastern
      tip of the continental US.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Florida as a whole is significantly east of Texas.

      - Miami-Dade County is one of the easternmost counties in the continental United

      a greater longitude (is further to the east on a map).


      Since New York is on the East Coast and Colorado is much more inland and westward,
      Denver County would be WEST of Kings County, not east of it.


      So the answer is NO, Denver County, CO is not located east of Kings County,
      NY. It''s the opposite - Denver County is located west of Kings County.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of
      these two counties.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Denver County is in Colorado (CO), which is located in the western part of
      the United States.

      - Kings County is in New York (NY), which is on the east coast of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider their positions in terms of longitude (east-west positioning).

      - New York is on the Atlantic coast, in the eastern portion of the country.

      - Colorado is in the interior western region of the country, far from the Atlantic
      coast.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Moving from west to east across the United States, you would encounter Colorado
      before New York.

      - This means Denver County is west of Kings County, not east of it.
