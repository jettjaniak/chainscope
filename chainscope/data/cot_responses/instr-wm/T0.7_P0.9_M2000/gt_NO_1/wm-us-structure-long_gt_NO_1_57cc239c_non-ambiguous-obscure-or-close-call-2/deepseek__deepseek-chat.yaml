      \ out whether Mount Carmel Center, TX is located east of Fenway Park, MA. At\
      \ first glance, it seems straightforward, but I realize I need to consider the\
      \ geographical locations of both places to answer this accurately. Here's how\
      \ I'm approaching the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\nFirst,\
      \ I need to know where Mount Carmel Center, TX, and Fenway Park, MA, are located.\n\
      \n1. **Mount Carmel Center, TX**: I'm not entirely sure where this is, but based\
      \ on the name, it seems to be a community or a specific site in Texas.\n   \n\
      2. **Fenway Park, MA**: I know that Fenway Park is a famous baseball stadium\
      \ located in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n### Step 2: Locate Texas and Massachusetts\
      \ on a Map\n\nTo understand the relative positions, I need to visualize where\
      \ Texas and Massachusetts are in the United States.\n\n- **Texas**: It's a large\
      \ state in the southern central part of the U.S., bordered by Oklahoma to the\
      \ north, Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, New Mexico to the\
      \ west, and the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast.\n\n- **Massachusetts**: It's\
      \ a smaller state in the northeastern part of the U.S., part of the New England\
      \ region. It's bordered by Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut,\
      \ New York, and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Longitudes\n\
      \nThe key to figuring out if Mount Carmel Center is east of Fenway Park lies\
      \ in their longitudes. Longitude measures how far east or west a location is\
      \ from the prime meridian (0\xB0 longitude).\n\n- Generally, locations with\
      \ higher longitude values are farther east.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Longitudes\
      \ of Both Places\n\nI need to find the longitude of Mount Carmel Center, TX,\
      \ and Fenway Park, MA.\n\n1. **Mount Carmel Center, TX**:\n   - After some research,\
      \ I find that Mount Carmel Center is located near Waco, Texas.\n   - The approximate\
      \ longitude of Mount Carmel Center is around -97.15\xB0.\n\n2. **Fenway Park,\
      \ MA**:\n   - Fenway Park is in Boston, Massachusetts.\n   - The approximate\
      \ longitude of Fenway Park is around -71.06\xB0.\n\n### Step 5: Compare the\
      \ Longitudes\n\nNow, I'll compare the two longitudes to see which location is\
      \ farther east.\n\n- Mount Carmel Center, TX: -97.15\xB0\n- Fenway Park, MA:\
      \ -71.06\xB0\n\nSince longitude increases as you move east, a smaller negative\
      \ number indicates a location farther east.\n\n- -71.06\xB0 is greater than\
      \ -97.15\xB0, meaning Fenway Park is farther east than Mount Carmel Center.\n\
      \n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\nBased on the longitude values:\n\n- Fenway Park,\
      \ MA (-71.06\xB0) is east of Mount Carmel Center, TX (-97.15\xB0).\n\nTherefore,\
      \ **Mount Carmel Center, TX is not located east of Fenway Park, MA**.\n\n**Final\
