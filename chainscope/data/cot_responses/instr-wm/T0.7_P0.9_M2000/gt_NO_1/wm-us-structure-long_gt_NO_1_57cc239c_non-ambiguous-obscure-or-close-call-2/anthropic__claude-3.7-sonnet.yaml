      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Mount Carmel Center is in Texas (TX)

      - Fenway Park is in Massachusetts (MA)


      Step 2: Determine their general geographic positions.

      - Texas is in the southwestern part of the United States

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - States in the northeastern US (like Massachusetts) are generally east of states
      in the southwestern US (like Texas)

      - This means Texas is west of Massachusetts


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific locations.

      - Since Mount Carmel Center is in Texas, and Texas is west of Massachusetts,
      Mount Carmel Center must be west of Fenway Park

      - Conversely, Fenway Park must be east of Mount Carmel Center


      Therefore, the answer is: NO


      Mount Carmel Center, TX is NOT located east of Fenway Park, MA. It is located

    5687af04-a196-4280-854a-d5bcc186835f: 'I need to determine the relative east-west
      positioning of The Beverly Hills Hotel in California and the United States Capitol
      in Washington, DC.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic locations of California and Washington, DC.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Washington, DC is on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 2: More specifically, Beverly Hills is in the Los Angeles area in southern
      California, which is on the western side of the continental United States.


      Step 3: The United States Capitol is in Washington, DC, which is on the eastern
      side of the continental United States.


      Step 4: When comparing east-west positions in the United States, locations on
      the west coast (like California) are west of locations on the east coast (like
      Washington, DC).


      Step 5: Therefore, The Beverly Hills Hotel in California must be west of the
      United States Capitol in Washington, DC, not east of it.


      NO, The Beverly Hills Hotel is not located east of the United States Capitol.
      It is located west of it.'

      of The Beverly Hills Hotel in California and the United States Capitol in Washington,
      DC.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - The Beverly Hills Hotel is in Beverly Hills, California, which is on the west
      coast of the United States.

      - The United States Capitol is in Washington, DC, which is on the east coast
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the United States.

      - California is the westernmost contiguous state in the US.

      - Washington, DC is near the eastern seaboard.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Moving from west to east across the United States, you would encounter California
      first, then eventually reach Washington, DC.

      - This means California (and anything in it) is west of Washington, DC (and
      anything in it).

      - Conversely, Washington, DC (and the Capitol) is east of California (and The
      Beverly Hills Hotel).


      Therefore, The Beverly Hills Hotel is NOT east of the United States Capitol.
      The Beverly Hills Hotel is west of the United States Capitol.


      NO'

      in Washington, DC.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - The Beverly Hills Hotel is in Beverly Hills, California, which is on the west
      coast of the United States.

      - The United States Capitol is in Washington, DC, which is on the east coast
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - California is located on the western side of the continental United States.

      - Washington, DC is located on the eastern side of the continental United States.

      - When we say something is "east of" something else, we mean it has a more easterly
      position.


      Step 3: Make the determination.

      - Since California is on the west coast and DC is on the east coast, The Beverly
      Hills Hotel is west of the United States Capitol, not east of it.


      NO, The Beverly Hills Hotel in CA is not located east of the United States Capitol

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - The Beverly Hills Hotel is in Beverly Hills, California, which is on the west
      coast of the United States.

      - The United States Capitol is in Washington, DC, which is on the east coast
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic orientation of the United States.

      - In the United States, the west coast (including California) is to the west
      of the east coast (including Washington, DC).

      - This means locations in California are generally west of locations in Washington,
      DC.


      Step 3: Apply this to the specific locations.

      - Since The Beverly Hills Hotel is in California (west coast), it is west of
      the United States Capitol in Washington, DC (east coast).

      - If The Beverly Hills Hotel is west of the Capitol, then it cannot be east
      of it.
