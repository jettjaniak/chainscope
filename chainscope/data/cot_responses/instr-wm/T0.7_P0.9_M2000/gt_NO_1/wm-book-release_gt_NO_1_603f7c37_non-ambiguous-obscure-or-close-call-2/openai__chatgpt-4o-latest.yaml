      1. Stephen King''s novel *It* was first published in 1986.


      2. Richard Osman''s *The Thursday Murder Club* was first published in 2020.


      Now, compare the two publication dates:


      - *It* (1986)

      - *The Thursday Murder Club* (2020)


      Since 1986 is earlier than 2020, *It* was released before *The Thursday Murder

      Step 1: Determine the release date of Donald F. Glut''s "The Empire Strikes

      - Donald F. Glut wrote the novelization of the movie "The Empire Strikes Back".

      - The movie "The Empire Strikes Back" was released in 1980.

      - The novelization was published shortly before or around the same time as the
      movie, in 1980.


      So, "The Empire Strikes Back" novelization was released in 1980.


      Step 2: Determine the release date of Brandon Sanderson''s "Mistborn: The Well
      of Ascension".


      - "Mistborn: The Well of Ascension" is the second book in the Mistborn trilogy.

      - It was published in 2007.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.


      - "The Empire Strikes Back" novelization: 1980

      - "Mistborn: The Well of Ascension": 2007


      1980 is earlier than 2007.
