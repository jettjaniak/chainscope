      we need to identify the release dates of both books and compare them.


      1. **Identify the release date of J. R. R. Tolkien''s The Return of the King**:
      The Return of the King was published on October 20, 1955.


      2. **Identify the release date of Stephenie Meyer''s Eclipse**: Eclipse was
      published on August 7, 2007.


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Since 1955 is earlier than 2007, The Return
      of the King was released before Eclipse.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is NO. J. R. R. Tolkien''s The Return
      of the King was not released later than Stephenie Meyer''s Eclipse.
