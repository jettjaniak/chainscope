      "A Series of Unfortunate Events" series. It was published on September 18, 2000.


      2. **Jay Asher''s Thirteen Reasons Why**: This book was published on October
      18, 2007.


      Comparing the publication dates, we can see that "The Austere Academy" was published
      before "Thirteen Reasons Why".
