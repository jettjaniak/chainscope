      first published in 1971. It''s known for its detailed plot to assassinate the
      President of France, Charles de Gaulle.

      Dubner is known for co-authoring "Freakonomics" with Steven Levitt), we need
      to establish the publication dates of both books.


      1. **Identify the correct title of Stephen Dubner''s book**: The correct title
      is "Freakonomics", not "The Hidden Side of Everything". However, Stephen Dubner
      and Steven Levitt did publish a book titled "Freakonomics", and later, they
      published "SuperFreakonomics" and "Think Like a Freak". There''s also a book
      titled "The Hidden Side of Everything" but it seems to be a confusion with one
      of the Freakonomics series books, specifically "Think Like a Freak" or actually
      "The Hidden Side of Everything" might be confused with "SuperFreakonomics" subtitle
      "Global Cooling, Patriotic Prostitutes, and Why Suicide Bombers Should Buy Life
      Insurance", but actually "The Hidden Side of Everything" is not a real title
      of their series, it might be confused with "What the Dog Saw" by Malcolm Gladwell
      or "The Undercover Economist" by Tim Harford or another book. The actual confusion
      seems to be with the real title "Think Like a Freak", but the actual book that
      follows "Freakonomics" is "SuperFreakonomics".

      3. **Publication date of Stephen Dubner''s "Freakonomics"**: The first book

      was published in 1994, and "Freakonomics" by Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt

      1. **Identify the publication date of "On the Road" by Jack Kerouac**: "On the
      Road" was first published on September 5, 1957.


      2. **Identify the publication date of "The Wolf of Wall Street" by Jordan Belfort**:
      Jordan Belfort''s memoir, "The Wolf of Wall Street," was published in 2007.

      we need to determine the release dates of the two books: "A Thousand Splendid
      Suns" by Khaled Hosseini and "Playing It My Way" by Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar.


      1. **Identify the release date of "A Thousand Splendid Suns":** Khaled Hosseini''s
      "A Thousand Splendid Suns" was published in 2007.


      2. **Identify the release date of "Playing It My Way":** Sachin Tendulkar''s

      World" and Stephen King''s "The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla".


      1. **Identify the release year of "Sophie''s World":** Jostein Gaarder''s "Sophie''s
      World" was first published in Norwegian in 1991.


      2. **Identify the release year of "The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla":**
      Stephen King''s "The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla" was published in 2003.


      3. **Compare the release dates:** Since "Sophie''s World" was published in 1991
      and "The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla" was published in 2003, "Sophie''s
      World" was released earlier than "The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla".


      Given this information, the answer to whether "Sophie''s World" was released
      later than "The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla" is: **NO**.'

      Donald F. Glut wrote the novelization of "The Empire Strikes Back", which is

      Donald F. Glut was released in 1980.


      2. **Identify the Release Year of Brandon Sanderson''s Mistborn: The Well of
      Ascension**: Brandon Sanderson''s "Mistborn: The Well of Ascension" is the second
      book in the Mistborn series. It was published in 2007.


      3. **Compare the Release Years**: Now, we compare the release years of the two
      books. "The Empire Strikes Back" novelization by Donald F. Glut was released
      in 1980, and "Mistborn: The Well of Ascension" by Brandon Sanderson was released
      in 2007.


      Given these steps, since 1980 is before 2007, "The Empire Strikes Back" was
      released earlier than "Mistborn: The Well of Ascension". Therefore, the answer
      to whether Donald F. Glut''s "The Empire Strikes Back" was released later than
      Brandon Sanderson''s "Mistborn: The Well of Ascension" is:


      NO'

      Meyer''s Twilight was released later than Hilary Mantel''s The Mirror & The
      Light, let''s break down the necessary steps:


      1. **Identify the release year of Stephenie Meyer''s Twilight**: Twilight, the
      first book in the Twilight Saga, was published in 2005.


      2. **Identify the release year of Hilary Mantel''s The Mirror & The Light**:
      The Mirror & The Light is the third book in Hilary Mantel''s Wolf Hall trilogy,
      following Wolf Hall (2009) and Bring Up the Bodies (2012). The Mirror & The
      Light was published in 2020.


      3. **Compare the release years**: Since 2005 (the release year of Twilight)
      is earlier than 2020 (the release year of The Mirror & The Light), we can conclude
      that Twilight was released before The Mirror & The Light.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Stephenie Meyer''s Twilight was released later
      than Hilary Mantel''s The Mirror & The Light is: **NO**.'

      we need to compare the release dates of Stephenie Meyer''s Twilight and Hilary
      Mantel''s The Mirror & The Light.


      1. First, let''s determine the release date of Stephenie Meyer''s Twilight.
      Twilight, the first book in the Twilight Saga, was released on October 5, 2005.


      2. Next, we''ll find the release date of Hilary Mantel''s The Mirror & The Light.
      The Mirror & The Light is the third book in the Thomas Cromwell trilogy by Hilary
      Mantel, and it was released on March 5, 2020 (in some countries March 10, 2020,
      due to time zones and local publication schedules).


      3. Now, we compare the two release dates. Since 2005 is before 2020, Stephenie
      Meyer''s Twilight was released earlier than Hilary Mantel''s The Mirror & The

      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the publication year of Donna Tartt''s The Secret History**: The
      Secret History was published in 1992.


      2. **Identify the publication year of Philip Pullman''s The Amber Spyglass**:
      The Amber Spyglass, which is the third book in Philip Pullman''s His Dark Materials
      trilogy, was published in 2000.


      3. **Compare the publication years**: Since 2000 (the publication year of The
      Amber Spyglass) is greater than 1992 (the publication year of The Secret History),
      this means The Secret History was published before The Amber Spyglass.


      Given these steps, the answer to whether Donna Tartt''s The Secret History was
      released later than Philip Pullman''s The Amber Spyglass is: NO.'
