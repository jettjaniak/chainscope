      According to the U.S. Census Bureau and recent estimates (as of 2023 or the
      latest available data):


      - San Antonio, TX has a population of approximately 1.47 million people.

      - San Diego, CA has a population of approximately 1.39 million people.


      Step 2: Compare the two population figures.


      - San Antonio: ~1.47 million

      - San Diego: ~1.39 million


      San Antonio''s population is slightly higher than San Diego''s.


      Step 3: Conclusion


      Since San Antonio has more residents than San Diego based on the most recent
      data,

      As of the 2020 U.S. Census and more recent estimates from 2023:


      - San Antonio, TX had a population of approximately 1.47 million.

      - San Diego, CA had a population of approximately 1.39 million.

      1. Santa Monica is a coastal city in Los Angeles County, California. It is known
      for being a smaller, affluent city with a strong tourism industry. Its population
      is relatively small compared to major US cities. As of the most recent estimates,
      Santa Monica has a population of around 90,000 people.

      - Santa Monica: ~90,000

      - Phoenix: ~1,600,000+

    e3bc6ffb-5782-488f-80a5-0bd42be4ea22: 'To determine whether Bronx, NY is more
      populous than Dallas, TX, we need to compare their populations.


      Step 1: Understand what "Bronx, NY" refers to.

      - The Bronx is one of the five boroughs of New York City. It is a part of the
      city, not a separate city on its own.

      - Therefore, its population is a subset of New York City''s total population.


      Step 2: Find the population of the Bronx.

      - As of recent estimates (2020 Census and later projections), the Bronx has
      a population of approximately 1.4 million people.


      Step 3: Find the population of Dallas, TX.

      - Dallas is a major city in Texas and functions as its own municipality.

      - According to 2020 Census data and recent estimates, Dallas has a population
      of approximately 1.3 to 1.4 million people.


      Step 4: Compare the populations.

      - The population of the Bronx (~1.4 million) is very close to that of Dallas
      (~1.3 to 1.4 million).

      - However, recent estimates show Dallas slightly edging out the Bronx in population.


      Step 5: Consider definitions and classification.

      - Since Dallas is an independent city and the Bronx is a borough of New York
      City, comparing them directly requires care.

      - But if the question is asking purely about population numbers regardless of
      administrative classification, we can proceed.


      Final assessment:

      - Based on the most recent data, Dallas, TX has a slightly higher population
      than the Bronx, NY.
