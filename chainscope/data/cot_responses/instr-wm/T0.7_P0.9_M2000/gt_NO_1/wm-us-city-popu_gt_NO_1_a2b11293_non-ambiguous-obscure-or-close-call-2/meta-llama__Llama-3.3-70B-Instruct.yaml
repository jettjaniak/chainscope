      we need to compare the population of Manhattan, NY, and Denver, CO.


      Step 1: Determine the population of Manhattan, NY. Manhattan is a borough of
      New York City, and according to the 2020 United States Census, the population
      of Manhattan is approximately 1,694,251.


      Step 2: Determine the population of Denver, CO. According to the 2020 United
      States Census, the population of Denver is approximately 716,492.


      Step 3: Compare the populations. Manhattan, NY, has a population of 1,694,251,
      while Denver, CO, has a population of 716,492.


      Since 1,694,251 is greater than 716,492, we can conclude that Manhattan, NY,
      is more populous than Denver, CO.
