      Step 1: Let me identify what these zip codes represent.

      - 70116 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)

      - 10014 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Let me determine more specific locations.

      - 70116 appears to be in New Orleans, Louisiana

      - 10014 appears to be in Manhattan, New York City


      Step 3: Consider the geographic positions of these locations in the United States.

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States

      - Louisiana is in the southeastern part of the United States, but west of New
      York


      Step 4: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - New York is further east than Louisiana

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 90210 is the zip code for Beverly Hills, California (CA)

      - 10011 is the zip code for an area in Manhattan, New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these locations in the United States.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, California is to the west of New
      York

      - This means New York is to the east of California


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - For 90210 (Beverly Hills, CA) to be east of 10011 (Manhattan, NY), California
      would need to be east of New York

      - However, California is west of New York, not east

      - New York is closer to the Atlantic Ocean than California

      - California is closer to the Pacific Ocean than New York

      - 94133 is in San Francisco, California

      - 10007 is in Manhattan, New York City, New York


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on the US map.

      - The United States spans from west to east, with the Pacific coast (including

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - Moving from west to east across the US, you go from California to New York

      - Therefore, California (including Venice, CA) is west of New York (including
      Brooklyn, NY)

      - Conversely, New York is east of California


      Step 4: Answer the specific question about 90291, CA being east of 11201, NY.

      - Since California is west of New York, 90291 (Venice, CA) is west of 11201
      (Brooklyn, NY)

      - 90291, CA is NOT east of 11201, NY

      - 90291 is a ZIP code in Venice, California

      - 11201 is a ZIP code in Brooklyn, New York


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the United States.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Moving from west to east across the continental US, you would go from California
      to New York

      - This means California is west of New York, not east of it


      Step 4: Make the conclusion.

      - Since 90291 (Venice, CA) is in California, and 11201 (Brooklyn, NY) is in
      New York, the California ZIP code must be west of the New York ZIP code, not

      Step 4: Make the conclusion about 90291, CA relative to 11201, NY.

      - Since 90291 is in California (west coast) and 11201 is in New York (east coast),
      90291 is west of 11201, not east of it

      - 70112 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA), specifically in New Orleans.

      - 10024 is a zip code in New York (NY), specifically in Manhattan, New York
      City.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these locations in the United States.

      - New York is on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Louisiana is in the southern part of the United States, along the Gulf Coast.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - New York is further east than Louisiana.

      - Louisiana is west of New York.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Louisiana (including 70112) is west of New York (including 10024), it
      cannot be east of New York.


      NO, 70112, LA is not located east of 10024, NY.'

      - New York is located in the northeastern part of the United States

      - Louisiana is located in the southeastern part of the United States

      - 33139 is a zip code in Florida (FL), specifically in Miami Beach.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Nevada is located in the western United States.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on a west-to-east basis.

      - Moving from west to east across the continental United States, you would encounter
      Nevada before Florida.

      - Nevada is west of Florida, which means Florida is east of Nevada.


      Step 4: Since the zip codes are in these respective states, the same relationship

      - Since California (where 94027 is located) is west of New York (where 10019
      is located), 94027 is NOT east of 10019.

      - In fact, it''s the opposite - 10019, NY is east of 94027, CA.


      NO, 94027, CA is not located east of 10019, NY.'

      of 10019, NY by identifying the locations and comparing their positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 94027 is a ZIP code in California (CA). Specifically, it''s in Atherton, which
      is in the San Francisco Bay Area on the west coast of the United States.

      - 10019 is a ZIP code in New York (NY). Specifically, it''s in Manhattan, New
      York City, on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States.

      - The continental United States spans from west to east, with the west coast
      (including California) being west of the east coast (including New York).


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Since California is west of New York, ZIP code 94027 in CA is west of ZIP
      code 10019 in NY.

      - "East of" would mean 94027 is located to the east of 10019, which is not the
      case.


      NO'

      Step 1: Let me identify what these zip codes represent.

      - 94027 is in California (CA)

      - 10019 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Determine the geographical orientation of these states.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, California is to the west of New
      York

      - Therefore, any location in California would be west of any location in New
      York, not east


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since California is west of New York, zip code 94027 in CA is west of zip
      code 10019 in NY

      - It is not east of the New York zip code


      NO'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 94027 is in Atherton, California, which is on the West Coast of the United
      States.

      - 10019 is in Manhattan, New York, which is on the East Coast of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - The United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean
      (east).

      - California is on the western side of the country, bordering the Pacific Ocean.

      - New York is on the eastern side of the country, bordering the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Therefore, California is west of New York, not east of it.


      Step 3: Make the comparison specific to these zip codes.

      - Since 94027 is in California (west) and 10019 is in New York (east), 94027
      is west of 10019.

      - Conversely, 10019 is east of 94027.
