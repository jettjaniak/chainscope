      - Longitude values become more negative as you move west.

      - Since -122.15 is more negative than -73.98, Palo Alto is further west than
      New York City.


      Therefore, 94301, CA is west of 10023, NY.

      - ZIP code 10024 is in New York City, specifically the Upper West Side of Manhattan.\n\
      \nStep 2: Understand how longitude works.\n- Longitude measures how far east\

      \ with more negative longitude values are farther west (since we are in the\
      \ Western Hemisphere).\n\nStep 3: Find the approximate longitudes.\n- New Orleans\

      \nConclusion:\nSince 70112 (New Orleans) is west of 10024 (New York City), it\
      \ is NOT located east of it.\n\nAnswer: NO."

      California is located east of zip code 10036 in New York, we need to understand
      their relative geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the zip codes.

      - Zip code 90265 is in Malibu, California.

      - Zip code 10036 is in Manhattan, New York City, New York.


      Step 2: Determine their longitudinal positions.

      - Malibu, CA (90265) is located on the west coast of the United States.

      - Manhattan, NY (10036) is on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Understand that "east of" refers to a location being at a higher longitude
      (further to the right on a map).

      - The longitude of Malibu, CA is approximately -118.8 degrees.

      - The longitude of Manhattan, NY is approximately -73.99 degrees.


      Step 4: Compare the longitudes.

      - Since -73.99 is greater than -118.8 (less negative), Manhattan is east of
      Malibu.

      - Therefore, Malibu is west of Manhattan.
