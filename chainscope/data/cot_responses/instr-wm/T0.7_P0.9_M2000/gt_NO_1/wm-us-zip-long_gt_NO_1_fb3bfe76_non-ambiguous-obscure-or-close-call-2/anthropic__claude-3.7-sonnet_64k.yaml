      \nNow, to determine if one is east of the other, I need to compare their relative\

      Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes.

      - 70116 is in Louisiana (LA)

      - 10014 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Find more specific information about these ZIP codes.


      ZIP code 70116 is located in New Orleans, Louisiana. New Orleans is in the southeastern
      part of Louisiana, near the Gulf of Mexico.


      ZIP code 10014 is located in Manhattan, New York City, New York. Manhattan is
      in the southeastern part of New York state, on the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions on a map of the United States.


      If we look at a map of the United States:

      - Louisiana is in the southern part of the country, bordering the Gulf of Mexico

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the country, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New York is significantly further east than Louisiana

      - Louisiana is more centrally/southern located in the US


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on east-west positioning.


      Since New York (where 10014 is located) is further east than Louisiana (where
      70116 is located), 70116 is NOT east of 10014. Instead, 70116 is WEST of 10014.

      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a U.S. map.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Louisiana is located in the southeastern/south-central United States

      - When looking at a map of the United States, New York is significantly further

      To determine this, I need to figure out where these zip codes are located and
      check their relative positions in terms of east-west orientation.


      Let me break this down:


      1. 90069 is in California (CA)

      2. 10003 is in New York (NY)


      In the United States, California is on the west coast, and New York is on the
      east coast. The continental United States generally spans from west to east
      as follows:

      - West Coast (Pacific Ocean): California, Oregon, Washington

      - East Coast (Atlantic Ocean): Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
      Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,
      South Carolina, Georgia, Florida


      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, California
      is west of New York, not east of it.


      Therefore, 90069, CA would be WEST of 10003, NY, not east of it.


      So the answer is NO, 90069, CA is not located east of 10003, NY.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 90069 is a zip code in California (CA)

      - 10003 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of California and New York.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship.

      - When comparing east-west positions in the continental United States, locations
      in California are always west of locations in New York

      - Moving east means going from California toward New York, not the other way
      around


      Therefore, 90069 (CA) is located west of 10003 (NY), not east of it.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      ## Step 3: Compare their positions

      - Moving east from California, you would travel across the country to reach

      2. New York is on the east coast of the United States.


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - 94133 is a zip code in California (CA)

      - 10007 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      The question is asking if 94133, CA is located east of 10007, NY.


      First, I need to recall the geographic orientation of California and New York
      in the United States. California is on the west coast, while New York is on
      the east coast. This means that California is generally west of New York.


      Since east and west are defined based on longitude (east is higher longitude
      numbers in the eastern hemisphere, but in the western hemisphere where the US
      is located, east is lower negative longitude numbers), California being west
      of New York means California has a higher negative longitude (or equivalently,
      a lower longitude value).


      If 94133, CA is west of 10007, NY, then it cannot be east of 10007, NY.


      So the answer is NO, 94133, CA is not located east of 10007, NY. It is located
      west of 10007, NY.</think>To determine if 94133, CA is east of 10007, NY, I

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 94133 is a zip code in San Francisco, California

      - 10007 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York


      Step 2: Recall the geographic orientation of the United States.

      California is located on the west coast of the United States, while New York
      is located on the east coast.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, California
      is west of New York. Therefore, San Francisco (94133) must be west of Manhattan
      (10007), not east of it.

      First, I need to identify the locations associated with these zip codes:

      - 94133, CA: This is a zip code in California.

      - 10007, NY: This is a zip code in New York.


      Next, I need to determine the relative positions of these locations. In the
      United States, California is on the west coast, while New York is on the east
      coast. Therefore, California is west of New York, not east of it.


      To be even more specific:

      - 94133 is a zip code in San Francisco, California, which is on the west coast
      of the US.

      - 10007 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York City, which is on the east coast
      of the US.


      Looking at a map of the United States, we can see that San Francisco is to the
      west of New York City. The United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west)
      to the Atlantic Ocean (east), with California on the Pacific side and New York
      on the Atlantic side.


      Therefore, 94133, CA (San Francisco) is located west of 10007, NY (Manhattan),

      I''m being asked whether the zip code 94133 in California is located east of
      the zip code 10007 in New York.


      In general, we know that:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States


      This means that in general, locations in California are west of locations in
      New York, not east of them.


      Let me be more specific with these zip codes:

      - 94133 is a zip code in San Francisco, California

      - 10007 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York City, New York


      Since San Francisco is on the west coast and Manhattan is on the east coast,
      94133 (San Francisco, CA) is west of 10007 (Manhattan, NY), not east of it.


      So to answer the question "Is 94133, CA located east of 10007, NY?", the answer
      is NO.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if 94133, CA is east of 10007, NY, I need to identify the locations
      and understand their positions on the US map.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both zip codes.

      - 94133 is a zip code in San Francisco, California

      - 10007 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York City, New York


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on the US map.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions directionally.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, locations in California are to
      the west of locations in New York

      - Going from New York to California means traveling westward, not eastward


      Therefore, 94133 (San Francisco, CA) is located to the west of 10007 (Manhattan,
      NY), not to the east.

      2. To answer this, I need to know the geographical locations of these zip codes.


      Let''s start with what I know about US geography:

      - California (CA) is on the west coast of the United States

      - New York (NY) is on the east coast of the United States


      Generally speaking, locations in California are west of locations in New York,
      not east of them.


      More specifically:

      - Zip code 94133 is in San Francisco, California

      - Zip code 10007 is in Manhattan, New York City, New York


      Since San Francisco is on the west coast and New York City is on the east coast,
      San Francisco (94133, CA) is west of New York City (10007, NY), not east of
      it.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is 94133, CA located east of 10007, NY?"
      is NO.</think>I need to determine if zip code 94133 in California is located
      east of zip code 10007 in New York.

      States.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      - When looking at a map of the US, California is to the west of New York

      - Moving eastward across the US means going from California toward New York
      (not the other way around)


      Therefore, San Francisco, CA (94133) is located west of Manhattan, NY (10007),

      \ the geographical locations of these zip codes and compare their positions\
      \ in terms of east and west.\n\nFirst, let's establish some basic facts about\
      \ the geography of the United States:\n- The United States spans from the Pacific\
      \ Ocean on the west to the Atlantic Ocean on the east.\n- California is a western\
      \ state, bordering the Pacific Ocean.\n- New York is an eastern state, bordering\
      \ the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIn terms of general geography, California is west of\
      \ New York. This means that locations in California are generally west (not\
      \ east) of locations in New York.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific zip codes:\n\
      - 90291 is a zip code in California. Based on my knowledge, this zip code is\
      \ in Venice, a neighborhood in Los Angeles, which is on the west coast of California.\n\
      - 11201 is a zip code in New York. I believe this is a zip code in Brooklyn,\
      \ New York City, which is on the east coast of the United States.\n\nSince California\
      \ is west of New York, and these specific locations (Venice, CA and Brooklyn,\
      \ NY) follow that general pattern, I can determine that 90291, CA is west of\

      90291, CA is located east of 11201, NY. Let me think step by step.


      First, I need to identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 90291, CA is a zip code in California

      - 11201, NY is a zip code in New York


      I know that:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States


      In terms of geography in the United States, east and west are determined by
      longitude (lines running north-south around the globe). The eastern parts of
      the US have higher longitude values than the western parts.


      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, California
      is west of New York. That means New York is east of California.


      Therefore, 90291, CA is NOT located east of 11201, NY. In fact, it''s the opposite
      - 11201, NY is east of 90291, CA.


      The answer is NO.</think>To determine if 90291, CA is located east of 11201,
      NY, I need to identify where these zip codes are located and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 90291 is a zip code in Venice, California

      - 11201 is a zip code in Brooklyn, New York


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of California and New York.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      In the United States, locations are considered "east" or "west" based on their
      longitude. The east coast (including New York) is further east than the west
      coast (including California).


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, 90291
      in California is west of 11201 in New York, not east of it.

      The question asks if 90291, CA is located east of 11201, NY.


      Let''s think about the geography of the United States:

      - California is a state on the west coast of the United States.

      - New York is a state on the east coast of the United States.


      In general, locations in California are west of locations in New York, not east

      To be more specific:

      1. 90291 is a zip code in Venice, Los Angeles, California, which is on the west
      coast of the US.

      2. 11201 is a zip code in Brooklyn, New York, which is on the east coast of

      I''ll need to:


      1. Identify the locations of these two zip codes

      2. Determine which one is further east


      Let''s start with the basic geographical understanding. The continental United
      States generally has:

      - West Coast (including California) on the west

      - East Coast (including New York) on the east


      94301 is in California (CA), which is on the West Coast.

      10023 is in New York (NY), which is on the East Coast.


      In the United States, locations on the East Coast are east of locations on the
      West Coast. So New York is east of California.


      Since 94301 is in California and 10023 is in New York, we can say that 94301
      is NOT east of 10023. In fact, it''s the opposite - 94301 is west of 10023.


      To be even more specific about these zip codes:

      - 94301 is in Palo Alto, California, which is in the San Francisco Bay Area
      on the West Coast

      - 10023 is in Manhattan, New York City, on the East Coast


      The answer is clearly NO - 94301 (CA) is NOT located east of 10023 (NY).</think>#
      Is 94301, CA located east of 10023, NY?


      I need to determine the relative geographic positions of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 94301 is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the United States

      - 10023 is in New York (NY), which is on the east coast of the United States


      ## Step 2: Compare their positions

      In the United States, states on the west coast (like California) are located
      to the west of states on the east coast (like New York).


      ## Step 3: Make the determination

      Since California is west of New York, zip code 94301 (CA) must be west of zip
      code 10023 (NY), not east of it.

      To solve this problem, I need to:

      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      Let me start with identifying the locations:


      94301 is a zip code in California (CA). Specifically, it''s in Palo Alto, which
      is in the San Francisco Bay Area on the west coast of the United States.


      10023 is a zip code in New York (NY). It''s in Manhattan (Upper West Side),
      which is on the east coast of the United States.


      Now, to determine which is east of the other:


      In the United States, California is on the west coast, while New York is on
      the east coast. This means that locations in New York are generally east of
      locations in California.


      So, 10023, NY (Manhattan) is east of 94301, CA (Palo Alto).


      The question asks if 94301, CA is located east of 10023, NY, which would be
      the opposite of what I just determined.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, 94301, CA is not located east of 10023, NY. Instead,

      - 94301 is a zip code in Palo Alto, California, which is on the west coast of
      the United States.

      - 10023 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York, which is on the east coast of
      the United States.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - In the United States, California is on the west coast, while New York is on
      the east coast.

      - This means that locations in New York are east of locations in California.

      - Therefore, 10023 (NY) is east of 94301 (CA), not the other way around.

      if the zip code 55425 in Minnesota (MN) is located east of the zip code 11976
      in New York (NY). To solve this, I''ll need to:


      1. Determine the geographical locations of these zip codes

      2. Compare their east-west positions (which means comparing their longitudes)

      3. Conclude whether 55425, MN is east of 11976, NY


      In the US, east-west position is determined by longitude. Eastern locations
      have smaller (less negative) longitude values than western locations. For example,
      New York is on the east coast and has a smaller longitude value than California
      on the west coast.


      Let me think about the general locations of Minnesota and New York:

      - Minnesota (MN) is in the upper Midwest of the United States

      - New York (NY) is on the east coast of the United States


      Generally speaking, New York is east of Minnesota. That would mean that a zip
      code in New York would typically be east of a zip code in Minnesota.


      However, I should verify the specific locations of these zip codes to be certain:


      Zip code 55425 is in Bloomington, Minnesota, which is near Minneapolis in the
      eastern part of Minnesota.

      Zip code 11976 appears to be in Water Mill, New York, which is on Long Island
      in the eastern part of New York state.


      Since New York is significantly east of Minnesota on the map of the United States,
      and these specific locations don''t change that general relationship, I can
      conclude that 55425, MN is NOT east of 11976, NY. Rather, 11976, NY is east
      of 55425, MN.


      So the answer is NO, 55425, MN is not located east of 11976, NY.</think># Step-by-Step
      Reasoning


      To determine if one location is east of another, I need to compare their positions
      on an east-west axis, which means comparing their longitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the zip codes.

      - 55425 is in Bloomington, Minnesota (near Minneapolis)

      - 11976 is in Water Mill, New York (on Long Island)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest of the United States

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - The East Coast (including New York) is significantly east of the Midwest (including
      Minnesota)

      - New York state is entirely east of Minnesota


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on geography.

      - Since New York is east of Minnesota, a zip code in New York (11976) would
      be east of a zip code in Minnesota (55425)

      - Therefore, 55425 in Minnesota is WEST of 11976 in New York, not east of it

      Generally speaking, New York is located in the northeastern part of the United

      2) Zip code 11976 is in New York, which is in the Northeast region of the United

      Looking at a mental map of the United States, states in the Northeast (including

      First, let me consider the general locations:

      Looking at the continental United States from west to east:

      - The West Coast states (like California) are furthest west

      - The Mountain and Midwest states (including Minnesota) are in the middle

      - The Northeast states (including New York) are furthest east


      Specifically, Minnesota is considerably west of New York. Any zip code in Minnesota

      Specifically, it asks whether 55425, MN is located east of 11976, NY.


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two locations on a map of the United States.


      Let me think about the general geographic positions of Minnesota (MN) and New
      York (NY) in the United States:


      - Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest region of the United States, bordering
      Canada to the north.

      - New York is located in the northeastern part of the United States, also bordering
      Canada (to the north and northwest).


      In terms of east-west positioning, New York is generally located east of Minnesota.
      The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the
      Pacific Ocean in the west, and New York is much closer to the Atlantic coast
      than Minnesota is.


      Let''s be more specific about the zip codes:


      55425 is a zip code in Minnesota. I believe it''s in the Minneapolis-St. Paul
      metropolitan area, which is in the eastern part of Minnesota.


      11976 is a zip code in New York. I believe it''s on Long Island, which extends
      eastward from New York City into the Atlantic Ocean.


      Even though 55425 is in the eastern part of Minnesota, New York''s position
      in the northeastern United States means that 11976, NY is still going to be
      east of 55425, MN.


      Moreover, Long Island extends quite far east into the Atlantic Ocean, and zip
      codes in the 11xxx range are typically on Long Island. This means 11976 is likely
      quite far east within New York State itself.


      Given these considerations, I can conclude that 55425, MN is NOT located east
      of 11976, NY. Instead, 55425, MN is located west of 11976, NY.


      So my answer is NO.</think># Is 55425, MN located east of 11976, NY?

      ## Step 4: Specific zip code locations

      - 55425 is in the Minneapolis area of Minnesota

      - 11976 appears to be in the Hamptons area of Long Island, which extends far

      Step 3: Specifically for these two states:

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States.

      - Minnesota is in the Midwest, significantly west of New York.


      Step 4: For the specific zip codes:

      - 55425 is in Minnesota, which we''ve established is west of New York.

      - 11976 is in New York, which we''ve established is east of Minnesota.

    3eb22e96-ed6b-46c4-9c26-80150eefc14b: '<think>This question is asking whether
      a location with zip code 70112 in Louisiana (LA) is located east of a location
      with zip code 10024 in New York (NY).


      First, I need to determine the locations of these zip codes.


      Zip code 70112 is in Louisiana, most likely in New Orleans (based on my knowledge
      of zip code ranges).

      Zip code 10024 is in New York, most likely in New York City (specifically Manhattan''s
      Upper West Side, based on my knowledge).


      Now I need to determine their relative positions on a map. The United States
      generally has states arranged from west to east, with the West Coast (California,
      Oregon, Washington) on the west and the East Coast (Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
      etc.) on the east.


      New York is on the East Coast, while Louisiana is in the South, along the Gulf
      of Mexico.


      If we look at a map of the United States, New York is definitely east of Louisiana.
      New York is approximately around 74 degrees west longitude, while Louisiana
      is around 90-92 degrees west longitude. Since a smaller west longitude number
      means further east, New York is east of Louisiana.


      Therefore, 70112, LA (likely New Orleans) is NOT located east of 10024, NY (likely
      New York City). Instead, it''s located west of the New York location.


      The answer is NO.</think># Is 70112, LA located east of 10024, NY?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the geographical locations of these
      zip codes and compare their positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 70112 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA), likely in New Orleans

      - 10024 is a zip code in New York (NY), likely in Manhattan''s Upper West Side


      ## Step 2: Consider US geography

      - The United States spans from west to east, with lower longitudes (degrees
      west) being further east

      - New York is on the East Coast of the United States

      - Louisiana is in the southern part of the United States near the Gulf of Mexico


      ## Step 3: Compare positions

      - New York is approximately around 74 degrees west longitude

      - Louisiana is approximately around 90 degrees west longitude

      - Since New York has a lower "west longitude" number than Louisiana, New York
      is east of Louisiana


      ## Conclusion

      Louisiana (70112) is west of New York (10024), not east of it.

      First, let''s identify the locations:

      - 70112, LA: This is a zip code in Louisiana. LA is the state abbreviation for
      Louisiana.

      - 10024, NY: This is a zip code in New York. NY is the state abbreviation for
      New York.


      Now I need to determine the east-west positioning of these locations.


      In the United States, locations are generally positioned as follows on an east-west
      axis:

      - The East Coast (including New York) is on the eastern side of the country

      - The Gulf Coast states (including Louisiana) are in the southern central part
      of the country


      New York is on the East Coast, while Louisiana is significantly west of the
      East Coast. So generally speaking, New York is east of Louisiana.


      Therefore, if 70112 is in Louisiana and 10024 is in New York, then 70112 is
      WEST of 10024, not east of it.


      To be even more specific:

      - 70112 appears to be a zip code in New Orleans, Louisiana

      - 10024 appears to be a zip code in Manhattan, New York City


      Louisiana is in the southern central part of the United States, while New York

      1. 94043 is a zip code in California (CA).

      2. 10012 is a zip code in New York (NY).

      3. The question is asking whether 94043, CA is located east of 10012, NY.


      To answer this, I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip
      codes on a west-east axis of the United States.


      California is on the west coast of the United States, while New York is on the
      east coast. In general, locations in California are west of locations in New
      York.


      East and west in the US are determined by longitude. Lower longitude values
      correspond to more eastward locations, and higher longitude values correspond
      to more westward locations.


      California, being on the west coast, has a higher longitude than New York, which
      is on the east coast. Therefore, California is west of New York, not east.


      So, 94043, CA is not located east of 10012, NY. Instead, it''s located west
      of 10012, NY.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.</think>I need to determine if 94043, CA is east

      - 94043 is a zip code in California (CA)

      - 10012 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of California and New York.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Determine their relative east-west positions.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, California is to the west of New
      York

      - Moving from New York to California means traveling westward, not eastward

      - Therefore, California (including zip code 94043) is west of New York (including
      zip code 10012)

      1. 94043 is a zip code in California (CA)

      2. 10012 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      3. The question asks if 94043, CA is located east of 10012, NY.


      To figure this out, I need to think about the geographic locations of these
      places in the United States.


      California is on the west coast of the United States, while New York is on the
      east coast of the United States.


      From a geographic perspective, locations on the west coast (like California)
      are west of locations on the east coast (like New York). That means:

      - California is west of New York

      - New York is east of California


      Since 94043 is in California, and 10012 is in New York, we can say that:

      - 94043, CA is west of 10012, NY

      - 10012, NY is east of 94043, CA


      The question asks if 94043, CA is located east of 10012, NY. From our reasoning
      above, we know that''s not true - it''s actually west of 10012, NY.

      First, I need to identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 94043 is a zip code in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the
      United States

      - 10012 is a zip code in New York (NY), which is on the east coast of the United
      States


      Next, I need to determine their relative positions:

      - The continental United States spans from west (Pacific Ocean) to east (Atlantic
      Ocean)

      - California is on the west coast, while New York is on the east coast

      - Therefore, any location in California is generally west of any location in
      New York

      - Conversely, any location in New York is generally east of any location in
      California


      Since 94043 (CA) is on the west coast and 10012 (NY) is on the east coast, 94043
      is located west of 10012, not east of it.

      So in general, locations in California are west of locations in New York, not

      Let me verify this by considering the specific zip codes:


      94043 is a zip code in California (CA). This is in the western United States.

      10012 is a zip code in New York (NY). This is in the eastern United States.


      Since California is west of New York, the zip code 94043 in CA is west of the

      To determine if ZIP code 94043 in California is east of ZIP code 10012 in New

      - 94043 is in California (CA)

      - 10012 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic layout of the United States

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - Moving east means going from west to east (from California toward New York)

      - Moving west means going from east to west (from New York toward California)


      Step 4: Make the determination

      - Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, California
      is west of New York

      - Therefore, ZIP code 94043 in CA is west of ZIP code 10012 in NY, not east

      1. 90028 is a zip code in California (CA)

      2. 11954 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      In the United States, the general geography is that:

      - New York is on the East Coast

      1. Figure out where 90028, CA is located

      2. Figure out where, 11954, NY is located

      3. Determine which is further east.


      The United States has a general zip code pattern:

      - East Coast (including NY) tends to have lower zip codes (starting with 0 and
      1)

      - West Coast (including CA) tends to have higher zip codes (starting with 9)


      Let''s first confirm the locations:


      90028 is a zip code in Los Angeles, California, which is on the West Coast of
      the US.

      11954 is a zip code in New York state, which is on the East Coast of the US.


      Now, in terms of east vs west:

      - The East Coast (New York) is further east than the West Coast (California)

      - Put another way, California is west of New York, not east of it


      Therefore, 90028, CA is NOT located east of 11954, NY. Rather, it''s located

      The answer is NO.</think>I need to determine the relative positions of these
      two zip codes to see which one is further east.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 90028 is a zip code in California (CA), located on the West Coast of the United
      States.

      - 11954 is a zip code in New York (NY), located on the East Coast of the United

      In the United States, generally:

      - East Coast states like New York (NY) are in the eastern part of the country

      - West Coast states like California (CA) are in the western part of the country


      The general pattern of zip codes in the US is that they start with lower numbers
      in the Northeast and increase as you go west and south. So just from the zip
      code numbers (90028 vs 11954), it suggests that 90028 is further west than 11954.

      90028 is a zip code in Los Angeles, California, which is on the West Coast of
      the United States.

      11954 is a zip code in New York state, which is on the East Coast of the United

      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 90028 is in California (CA)

      - 11954 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Determine east-west positioning

      - In the United States, when considering east-west positioning, the East Coast
      (including New York) is further east

      - The West Coast (including California) is further west

      - Moving from east to west across the US, you would go from New York to California,
      not vice versa


      Step 4: Compare the specific zip codes

      - 90028 (Hollywood area in Los Angeles, CA) is on the West Coast

      - 11954 (Montauk area in NY) is on the East Coast


      Therefore, 90028, CA is NOT east of 11954, NY. It is west of it.

      2. 33139, FL (Florida)


      The question asks if 89109, NV is located east of 33139, FL.


      To determine this, I need to know the relative east-west positioning of these

      - Nevada is located in the western part of the United States.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern part of the United States.


      Generally speaking, states on the east coast (like Florida) are east of states

      York. Let me solve this by figuring out the locations of these zip codes and
      comparing their positions.


      First, what are these locations?

      - 90265, CA: This is Malibu, California, which is on the west coast of the United
      States.

      - 10036, NY: This is in Manhattan, New York City, which is on the east coast
      of the United States.


      Now I need to determine which is east of the other. In the United States:

      - The East Coast (including New York) is in the eastern part of the country

      - The West Coast (including California) is in the western part of the country


      Moving from west to east across the United States, you would go from California
      to New York. This means that New York is east of California.


      So, is 90265, CA (Malibu) east of 10036, NY (Manhattan)? No, it''s the opposite
      - Malibu is west of Manhattan.


      Therefore, the answer is NO - 90265, CA is not located east of 10036, NY.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes and
      determine their relative positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 90265, CA is in Malibu, California

      - 10036, NY is in Manhattan, New York City


      Step 2: Determine their geographic positions.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      Looking at a map of the United States, California is to the west of New York.
      This means New York is east of California, not the other way around.


      NO - 90265, CA is not located east of 10036, NY. It''s located west of it.'

      to determine if 90265, CA (California) is located east of 10036, NY (New York).


      First, I''ll identify the locations:

      - 90265 is a ZIP code in California. Specifically, it''s for Malibu, CA, which
      is located on the west coast of the United States.

      - 10036 is a ZIP code in New York. This is in Manhattan, New York City, which
      is located on the east coast of the United States.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions:

      - The continental United States spans from west to east, with the Pacific Ocean
      on the west coast and the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States.


      Therefore, California (including 90265 Malibu) is located WEST of New York (including
      10036 Manhattan).


      The question asks if 90265, CA is located EAST of 10036, NY. Since California
      is west of New York, not east, the answer is NO.</think>I need to determine
      if 90265, CA is located east of 10036, NY by identifying their geographic positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 90265 is a zip code in California (CA), specifically Malibu, which is on the
      west coast of the United States.

      - 10036 is a zip code in New York (NY), specifically in Manhattan, which is
      on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - In the United States, the general orientation is that the Pacific Ocean is
      to the west and the Atlantic Ocean is to the east.

      - California is a western state bordering the Pacific Ocean.

      - New York is an eastern state near the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Moving from west to east across the United States, you would encounter California
      before New York.

      - Therefore, California (including Malibu''s 90265) is west of New York (including
      Manhattan''s 10036), not east of it.

      1. Is 90265, CA located east of 10036, NY?


      First, I need to identify what these locations are:

      - 90265 is a zip code in California (CA)

      - 10036 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      To determine if one location is east of another in the United States, I need
      to think about the relative positions:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States


      Generally speaking, locations in California are west of locations in New York,
      not east of them.


      When we say "east of," we mean that a location is positioned to the east (toward
      the Atlantic Ocean) relative to another location.


      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, a location
      in California (90265, CA) would be WEST of a location in New York (10036, NY),
      not east of it.


      More specifically:

      - 90265 is a zip code for Malibu, California, which is on the Pacific coast

      - 10036 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York City, which is on the Atlantic
      coast


      The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic
      Ocean (east). California borders the Pacific Ocean on the west, while New York
      is much closer to the Atlantic Ocean on the east.


      So, 90265, CA (Malibu) is WEST of 10036, NY (Manhattan), not east of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, 90265, CA is not located east of 10036, NY.</think>#
      Is 90265, CA located east of 10036, NY?


      To answer this question, I need to identify these zip codes and determine their
      relative positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 90265 is a zip code in California (CA), specifically for Malibu

      - 10036 is a zip code in New York (NY), specifically in Manhattan


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      ## Step 3: Determine relative position

      In the United States, locations are generally considered "east" when they are
      closer to the Atlantic Ocean and "west" when they are closer to the Pacific
      Ocean.


      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, a California
      zip code would be WEST of a New York zip code, not east of it.


      NO, 90265, CA is not located east of 10036, NY.'

      \ if the ZIP code 94027, CA is located east of the ZIP code 10019, NY. Let me\
      \ break this down step by step.\n\n1. Identify the locations of these ZIP codes:\n\
      \   - 94027 is in California (CA)\n   - 10019 is in New York (NY)\n\n2. Determine\
      \ the relative east-west positioning of these locations.\n\nThe United States\
      \ is oriented such that the East Coast (where New York is located) is to the\
      \ east, and the West Coast (where California is located) is to the west. This\
      \ is basic US geography.\n\nNew York is on the East Coast, while California\
      \ is on the West Coast. Therefore, California is west of New York, not east\
      \ of it.\n\nSo, is 94027, CA located east of 10019, NY?\n\nNo, it's not. ZIP\
      \ code 94027 in California is located WEST of ZIP code 10019 in New York, not\
      \ east of it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is NO.</think># Reasoning about the locations\
      \ of ZIP codes 94027, CA and 10019, NY\n\nTo determine if 94027, CA is east\
      \ of 10019, NY, I need to consider the geographic locations of these ZIP codes.\n\
      \nFirst, let me identify the locations:\n- 94027 is a ZIP code in California\
      \ (CA), which is on the west coast of the United States\n- 10019 is a ZIP code\
      \ in New York (NY), which is on the east coast of the United States\n\nIn terms\
      \ of US geography, states on the west coast (like California) are located west\
      \ of states on the east coast (like New York). The continental United States\
      \ spans from the Pacific Ocean on the west to the Atlantic Ocean on the east.\n\
      \nTherefore, California is west of New York, not east of it. This means ZIP\
      \ code 94027 in California is located west of ZIP code 10019 in New York.\n\n\

      \ (CA), specifically for Atherton, which is in the San Francisco Bay Area in\
      \ Northern California.\n\n10019 is a zip code in New York (NY), specifically\
      \ in Manhattan, New York City.\n\nNow, to determine which is eastward of the\
      \ other, I need to consider their relative positions on a map of the United\
      \ States.\n\nThe United States spans from the Pacific Ocean on the west to the\
      \ Atlantic Ocean on the east. California is on the west coast, while New York\
      \ is on the east coast.\n\nGoing from west to east across the contiguous United\
      \ States, we would travel from California to New York. \n\nTherefore, California\
      \ is west of New York, not east of it. This means that 94027, CA (Atherton,\

      1) First, let me identify these zip codes:\n   - 94027 is in Atherton, California\n\
      \   - 10019 is in Manhattan, New York\n\n2) Now I need to consider the geography\
      \ of the United States:\n   - California is located on the west coast of the\
      \ United States\n   - New York is located on the east coast of the United States\n\
      \n3) When looking at a map of the US, going from west to east:\n   - The Pacific\
      \ Ocean borders California on the west\n   - New York borders the Atlantic Ocean\
      \ on the east\n   - California is therefore west of New York\n\n4) Since 94027\
      \ is in California and 10019 is in New York, the California zip code must be\
      \ west of the New York zip code, not east of it.\n\n# Answer: NO"
