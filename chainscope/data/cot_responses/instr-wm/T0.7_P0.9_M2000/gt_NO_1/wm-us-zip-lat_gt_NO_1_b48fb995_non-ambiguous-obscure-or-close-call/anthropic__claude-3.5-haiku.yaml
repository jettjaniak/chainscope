      - Manhattan is located in the southern part of New York State


      2. Now, let''s look at the second zip code: 11976, NY

      - This is a Long Island zip code

      - The first two digits (11) indicate it''s on Long Island

      - Long Island is located east of Manhattan, but generally south of Manhattan


      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - 10014 (Manhattan) is north of 11976 (Long Island)

      - Manhattan is geographically north of the location represented by this Long
      Island zip code


      4. Therefore, 10014, NY is indeed located north of 11976, NY.
