      1. First, let''s consider the location of the South China Sea:

      - The South China Sea is located in the western Pacific Ocean

      - It is situated southeast of China, near countries like Vietnam, Philippines,
      and Malaysia

      - It is in the tropical/subtropical region of Asia


      2. Next, let''s consider the location of the Canadian Rockies:

      - The Canadian Rockies are a mountain range located in western Canada

      - They are in the northern part of North America

      - They are in a temperate climate zone


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - The South China Sea is in the southern hemisphere/tropical region

      - The Canadian Rockies are in the northern hemisphere/temperate region

      - These locations are on opposite sides of the globe


      4. Specifically, is the South China Sea north of the Canadian Rockies?

      - No, the South China Sea is actually south of the Canadian Rockies

      - The South China Sea is much further south, closer to the equator


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
