      1. First, let''s locate Central Park''s Great Lawn N:

      - It is located in the central part of Manhattan

      - It is in the middle of Central Park, roughly between 79th and 86th Streets


      2. Next, let''s locate Columbia University Journalism School:

      - Columbia University''s campus is located in Morningside Heights

      - The Journalism School is specifically located around 116th Street


      3. Comparing their east-west positions:

      - Central Park''s Great Lawn N is around 79th-86th Streets

      - Columbia Journalism School is around 116th Street

      - Both are in the central/upper west side of Manhattan


      4. Determining relative east-west position:

      - The Journalism School is further north and west compared to the Great Lawn

      - This means the Great Lawn is more to the east relative to the Journalism School


      5. Conclusion:

      YES, Central Park Great Lawn N is located east of Columbia University Journalism

      - The Charging Bull Statue is located in the Financial District in Lower Manhattan

      - Specifically, it''s near Bowling Green in Lower Manhattan


      2. Next, locate JFK Terminal 4:

      - JFK Airport is located in Queens, New York

      - Terminal 4 is specifically in the southeastern part of the airport


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Manhattan is west of Queens

      - The Charging Bull Statue is in Lower Manhattan, which is even further west

      - JFK Terminal 4 is in southeastern Queens


      4. Determine relative positioning:

      - Since the Charging Bull Statue is in Manhattan (west) and JFK Terminal 4 is
      in Queens (east), the Charging Bull Statue is WEST of JFK Terminal 4


      5. Answer the specific question: "Is CHARGING BULL STATUE, Manhattan located
      east of JFK TERMINAL 4, Queens?"


      The answer is: NO'

      1. First, let''s consider the locations of Times Square Plaza and Rockefeller
      Center in Manhattan.


      2. Times Square is located at the intersection of Broadway and 7th Avenue, in
      the Midtown area of Manhattan.


      3. Rockefeller Center is located between 5th and 6th Avenues, from 48th to 51st
      Streets.


      4. 5th Avenue runs north-south and is considered the dividing line between east
      and west in Manhattan.


      5. Times Square is located closer to 7th Avenue, which is west of 5th Avenue.


      6. Rockefeller Center is located between 5th and 6th Avenues, which is also
      west of 5th Avenue.


      7. However, Times Square is further west than Rockefeller Center.


      8. Therefore, Times Square Plaza is NOT east of Rockefeller Center.

      - It is located on the east side of Manhattan

      - Specifically, it is situated at First Avenue between 34th and 38th Streets


      2. Next, locate the Central Park Reservoir:

      - The Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir is located in the middle of Central
      Park

      - It is roughly between 86th and 96th Streets


      3. Determine their relative positions:

      - NYU Langone Medical Center is at 34th-38th Streets

      - The Reservoir is at 86th-96th Streets

      - The Medical Center is SOUTH of the Reservoir


      4. Determine their east-west positioning:

      - Both are on the east side of Manhattan

      - The Medical Center is east of the Reservoir''s location

      - This means it is west of Broadway, in Midtown Manhattan


      2. Next, locate COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY:

      - Columbia University is located in Morningside Heights

      - This neighborhood is in the Upper West Side of Manhattan

      - Its address is at 116th Street and Broadway

      - This is further north and west compared to the Neil Simon Theatre


      3. Compare their relative east-west positions:

      - The Neil Simon Theatre is at 52nd Street, west of Broadway

      - Columbia University is at 116th Street, also west of Broadway

      - But the Neil Simon Theatre is further east (closer to Broadway/Times Square)
      than Columbia University


      4. Therefore, the Neil Simon Theatre is NOT east of Columbia University.

    cd8a64ad-fda7-4106-9640-c35b2d028cf3: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Brooklyn Bridge EB RB:

      - This is located in Lower Manhattan, near the East River

      - Its coordinates are roughly at the southern tip of Manhattan


      2. Next, locate Stephen A. Schwarzman Building (NY Public Library):

      - This is located in Midtown Manhattan

      - Specifically, it''s at 5th Avenue and 42nd Street

      - This is further north in Manhattan compared to Brooklyn Bridge


      3. Compare their east-west positions:

      - Both are in Manhattan

      - Brooklyn Bridge is closer to the East River (eastern side of Manhattan)

      - The NY Public Library is more centrally located in Manhattan


      4. Determine relative east-west positioning:

      - Brooklyn Bridge is east of the NY Public Library


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      - This is in the west-central part of Manhattan


      2. Next, locate Central Park West Area B:

      - Central Park West runs along the western edge of Central Park

      - Area B would be a specific section on the west side near Central Park


      3. Determine their relative positions:

      - The New Amsterdam Theatre is west of Central Park

      - Central Park West Area B is also west of Central Park, but further north

      - Specifically, the New Amsterdam Theatre is located further south and west
      compared to Central Park West Area B


      4. Comparing their east-west positions:

      - Since the New Amsterdam Theatre is west of Central Park West Area B, it is
      NOT east of it


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'

      - It is its own separate island, not part of Manhattan


      2. Next, let''s locate the Comcast Building:

      - The Comcast Building is located in Manhattan

      - Specifically, it is part of Rockefeller Center at 30 Rockefeller Plaza


      3. Since Ellis Island is not even in Manhattan, the question of its location
      relative to the Comcast Building becomes moot


      4. Therefore, the question cannot be answered with a simple east/west comparison


      5. The premise of the question is fundamentally flawed because Ellis Island
      is not in Manhattan


      The answer is: NO (Ellis Island is not in Manhattan, so the east/west comparison
      is invalid)'

      1. First, let''s locate Ellis Island:

      - Ellis Island is actually NOT in Manhattan

      - It is located in New York Harbor, between New York and New Jersey

      - It is technically part of both states, but not within Manhattan itself


      2. Next, let''s locate the Comcast Building:

      - The Comcast Building is located in Manhattan

      - Specifically, it is part of Rockefeller Center in Midtown Manhattan


      3. Since Ellis Island is not even in Manhattan, the directional relationship
      (east or west) to the Comcast Building becomes irrelevant.


      4. The premise of the question is fundamentally incorrect because Ellis Island
      is not in Manhattan.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'
