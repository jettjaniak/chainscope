      1. First, let''s recall the locations of these lakes:

      - Lake Victoria is located in East Africa (Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania)

      - Lake Michigan is located in the United States (bordering several states)


      2. Now, let''s check their areas:

      - Lake Victoria''s area is approximately 68,800 square kilometers

    ecd5e416-1690-429e-b7ce-42c08837ce36: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s look at Lake Como:

      - Lake Como is located in Italy

      - It is a glacial lake in Lombardy

      - Its area is approximately 146 square kilometers


      2. Now, let''s consider the Great Lakes:

      - The Great Lakes are a series of interconnected freshwater lakes in North America

      - They include Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario

      - Lake Superior alone has an area of about 82,100 square kilometers


      3. Comparing the areas:

      - Lake Como: 146 sq km

      - Great Lakes (just Lake Superior): 82,100 sq km


      4. Conclusion:

      Lake Como is much, much smaller than even just one of the Great Lakes (Lake
      Superior). The Great Lakes as a whole are vastly larger.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, Lake Como does not have a larger area than the
      Great Lakes.'
