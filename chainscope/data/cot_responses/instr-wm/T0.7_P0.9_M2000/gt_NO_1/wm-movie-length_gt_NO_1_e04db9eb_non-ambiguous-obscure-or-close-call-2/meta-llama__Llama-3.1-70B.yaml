      "Anchorman" refers to "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" (2004) directed
      by Adam McKay and starring Will Ferrell. "The Godfather" refers to "The Godfather"
      (1972) directed by Francis Ford Coppola.

      is approximately 98 minutes.


      3. **Runtime of The Godfather**: The runtime of "The Godfather" is approximately
      175 minutes.


      4. **Comparison**: Now, we compare the lengths of "Anchorman" (98 minutes) and

      \ we need to compare the lengths of two movies: David Yates's \"Harry Potter\
      \ and the Deathly Hallows\" and Peter Jackson's \"The Hobbit\".\n\n1. **Identify\
      \ the Movies**: First, we need to clarify which movies we are comparing. \"\
      Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" is a two-part film: \"Harry Potter and\
      \ the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1\" and \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\
      \ \u2013 Part 2\". Peter Jackson's \"The Hobbit\" is also a trilogy: \"The Hobbit:\
      \ An Unexpected Journey\", \"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug\", and \"The\
      \ Hobbit: There and Back Again\" (later retitled \"The Hobbit: The Battle of\
      \ the Five Armies\").\n\n2. **Determine the Version**: Since \"Harry Potter\
      \ and the Deathly Hallows\" and \"The Hobbit\" are both split into multiple\
      \ parts, we need to decide whether we're comparing the total runtime of each\
      \ series or each part individually. For a fair comparison, let's consider the\
      \ total runtime of each series.\n\n3. **Runtime of Harry Potter and the Deathly\
      \ Hallows**:\n   - \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1\" has\
      \ a runtime of approximately 146 minutes.\n   - \"Harry Potter and the Deathly\
      \ Hallows \u2013 Part 2\" has a runtime of approximately 130 minutes.\n   -\
      \ Total runtime for \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" is 146 + 130 =\
      \ 276 minutes.\n\n4. **Runtime of The Hobbit**:\n   - \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected\
      \ Journey\" has a runtime of approximately 169 minutes.\n   - \"The Hobbit:\
      \ The Desolation of Smaug\" has a runtime of approximately 161 minutes.\n  \
      \ - \"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\" has a runtime of approximately\
      \ 144 minutes.\n   - Total runtime for \"The Hobbit\" trilogy is 169 + 161 +\
      \ 144 = 474 minutes.\n\n5. **Comparison**: Now, we compare the total runtime\
      \ of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" (276 minutes) with the total runtime\
      \ of \"The Hobbit\" trilogy (474 minutes).\n\nSince 276 minutes (the total runtime\
      \ of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\") is less than 474 minutes (the\
      \ total runtime of \"The Hobbit\" trilogy), the answer to whether David Yates's\
      \ \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" is longer than Peter Jackson's \"\
      The Hobbit\" is NO.\n\n"

      \ let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify the movies**: We need to\
      \ identify the specific movies being compared. \"Harry Potter and the Deathly\
      \ Hallows\" refers to the final installment in the Harry Potter film series,\
      \ which was released as two parts: \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013\
      \ Part 1\" and \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2\". \"The\
      \ Hobbit\" refers to a trilogy of films based on J.R.R. Tolkien's novel of the\
      \ same name: \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\", \"The Hobbit: The Desolation\
      \ of Smaug\", and \"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\".\n\n2. **Determine\
      \ the runtime of each movie**:\n   - \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\
      \ \u2013 Part 1\" has a runtime of approximately 146 minutes.\n   - \"Harry\
      \ Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2\" has a runtime of approximately\
      \ 130 minutes.\n   - \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\" has a runtime of\
      \ approximately 169 minutes.\n   - \"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug\" has\
      \ a runtime of approximately 161 minutes.\n   - \"The Hobbit: The Battle of\
      \ the Five Armies\" has a runtime of approximately 144 minutes.\n\n3. **Compare\
      \ the runtimes**: \n   - The total runtime for \"Harry Potter and the Deathly\
      \ Hallows\" (Parts 1 and 2) is 146 minutes + 130 minutes = 276 minutes.\n  \
      \ - The total runtime for \"The Hobbit\" trilogy is 169 minutes + 161 minutes\
      \ + 144 minutes = 474 minutes.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \"The Hobbit\" trilogy\

      \ the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1\" and \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\
      \ \u2013 Part 2\". Peter Jackson's \"The Hobbit\" is also a trilogy: \"The Hobbit:\
      \ An Unexpected Journey\", \"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug\", and \"The\
      \ Hobbit: There and Back Again\" (later retitled \"The Hobbit: The Battle of\
      \ the Five Armies\").\n\n2. **Determine the Version**: Since \"Harry Potter\
      \ and the Deathly Hallows\" and \"The Hobbit\" are both split into multiple\
      \ parts, we need to decide whether we're comparing the total runtime of each\
      \ series or each part individually. For a fair comparison, let's consider the\
      \ total runtime of each series.\n\n3. **Runtime of Harry Potter and the Deathly\
      \ Hallows**:\n   - \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1\" has\
      \ a runtime of approximately 146 minutes.\n   - \"Harry Potter and the Deathly\
      \ Hallows \u2013 Part 2\" has a runtime of approximately 130 minutes.\n   -\
      \ Total runtime for \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" is 146 + 130 =\
      \ 276 minutes.\n\n4. **Runtime of The Hobbit**:\n   - \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected\
      \ Journey\" has a runtime of approximately 169 minutes.\n   - \"The Hobbit:\
      \ The Desolation of Smaug\" has a runtime of approximately 161 minutes.\n  \
      \ - \"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\" has a runtime of approximately\
      \ 144 minutes.\n   - Total runtime for \"The Hobbit\" trilogy is 169 + 161 +\
      \ 144 = 474 minutes.\n\n5. **Comparison**: Now, we compare the total runtime\
      \ of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" (276 minutes) with the total runtime\
      \ of \"The Hobbit\" trilogy (474 minutes).\n\nSince 276 minutes (the total runtime\
      \ of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\") is less than 474 minutes (the\
      \ total runtime of \"The Hobbit\" trilogy), the answer to whether David Yates's\
      \ \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" is longer than Peter Jackson's \"\
      The Hobbit\" is NO.\n\n"

      we need to compare the lengths of two movies: Oliver Stone''s "Wall Street"
      and Ramesh Sippy''s "Seeta Aur Geeta".


      1. **Identify the Movies**: First, we need to clarify which movies we are comparing.
      "Wall Street" is a 1987 American drama film directed by Oliver Stone. "Seeta
      Aur Geeta" is a 1972 Indian Hindi-language film directed by Ramesh Sippy.


      2. **Find the Runtime**: We need to find the runtime of each movie to compare
      their lengths. Runtime refers to the duration of the movie, usually expressed
      in minutes.


      3. **Runtime of Wall Street**: According to various sources, including IMDb,
      "Wall Street" (1987) has a runtime of approximately 126 minutes (2 hours and
      6 minutes).


      4. **Runtime of Seeta Aur Geeta**: According to various sources, including IMDb,
      "Seeta Aur Geeta" (1972) has a runtime of approximately 166 minutes (2 hours
      and 46 minutes).


      5. **Comparison**: Now, we compare the runtime of "Wall Street" (126 minutes)
      with the runtime of "Seeta Aur Geeta" (166 minutes).


      Since 126 minutes (the runtime of "Wall Street") is less than 166 minutes (the
      runtime of "Seeta Aur Geeta"), the answer to whether Oliver Stone''s "Wall Street"
      is longer than Ramesh Sippy''s "Seeta Aur Geeta" is NO.

      1. **Identify the Movies**: First, we need to clarify which movies we are comparing.
      "Aradhana" is a 1969 Indian Hindi-language film directed by Shakti Samanta.
      "The Chronicles of Narnia" refers to a series of films based on the novels by
      C.S. Lewis. For this comparison, we''ll assume we are referring to the first
      film in the series, "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"
      (2005), directed by Andrew Adamson.


      2. **Determine the Version**: Since "Aradhana" is a single film and "The Chronicles
      of Narnia" is a series, we''ll compare the length of "Aradhana" with the length
      of the first film in the Narnia series.


      3. **Runtime of Aradhana**: According to various sources, including IMDb, "Aradhana"
      has a runtime of approximately 169 minutes.


      4. **Runtime of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe**:
      The first film in the Narnia series, "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the
      Witch and the Wardrobe," has a runtime of approximately 145 minutes.


      5. **Comparison**: Now, we compare the runtime of "Aradhana" (169 minutes) with
      the runtime of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"
      (145 minutes).


      Since 169 minutes (the runtime of "Aradhana") is greater than 145 minutes (the

      we need to compare the lengths of two movies: Jay Roach''s "Meet the Parents"
      and Sam Taylor-Johnson''s "Fifty Shades".


      1. **Identify the Movies**: First, we need to clarify which movies we are comparing.
      "Meet the Parents" is a comedy film directed by Jay Roach and released in 2000.
      "Fifty Shades" refers to the film adaptation of the novel "Fifty Shades of Grey"
      directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and released in 2015.


      2. **Determine the Version**: Since both movies are single films, we don''t
      need to consider multiple parts or versions.


      3. **Runtime of Meet the Parents**: The runtime of "Meet the Parents" is approximately
      108 minutes.


      4. **Runtime of Fifty Shades**: The runtime of "Fifty Shades" is approximately
      125 minutes.


      5. **Comparison**: Now, we compare the runtime of "Meet the Parents" (108 minutes)
      with the runtime of "Fifty Shades" (125 minutes).


      Since 108 minutes (the runtime of "Meet the Parents") is less than 125 minutes
      (the runtime of "Fifty Shades"), the answer to whether Jay Roach''s "Meet the
      Parents" is longer than Sam Taylor-Johnson''s "Fifty Shades" is NO.

    ba6986a1-5994-4f75-9e3c-e3e5eb8e1e83: 'To answer this question,
      we need to compare the lengths of two movies: Chandra Barot''s "Don" and Anurag
      Kashyap''s "Gangs of Wasseypur".


      1. **Identify the Movies**: First, we need to clarify which movies we are comparing.
      "Don" is a 1978 Indian action film directed by Chandra Barot. "Gangs of Wasseypur"
      is a 2012 Indian crime drama directed by Anurag Kashyap. It is important to
      note that "Gangs of Wasseypur" is a two-part film, and we will consider the
      combined runtime of both parts for comparison.


      2. **Determine the Version**: Since "Gangs of Wasseypur" is a two-part film,
      we need to decide whether we''re comparing the total runtime of both parts or
      each part individually. For a fair comparison, let''s consider the total runtime
      of both parts.


      3. **Runtime of Don**: The runtime of Chandra Barot''s "Don" is approximately
      175 minutes (2 hours and 55 minutes).


      4. **Runtime of Gangs of Wasseypur**: The runtime of Anurag Kashyap''s "Gangs
      of Wasseypur" (both parts combined) is approximately 321 minutes (5 hours and
      21 minutes).


      5. **Comparison**: Now, we compare the runtime of "Don" (175 minutes) with the
      runtime of "Gangs of Wasseypur" (321 minutes).


      Since 175 minutes (the runtime of "Don") is less than 321 minutes (the runtime
      of "Gangs of Wasseypur"), the answer to whether Chandra Barot''s "Don" is longer
      than Anurag Kashyap''s "Gangs of Wasseypur" is NO.

      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Movies**: Chandra Barot''s "Don" refers to the 1978 Indian
      action-thriller film starring Amitabh Bachchan. Anurag Kashyap''s "Gangs of
      Wasseypur" refers to the 2012 Indian crime film directed by Anurag Kashyap.


      2. **Determine the Runtime of "Don"**: The runtime of the 1978 film "Don" is
      approximately 175 minutes (2 hours and 55 minutes).


      3. **Determine the Runtime of "Gangs of Wasseypur"**: The runtime of the 2012
      film "Gangs of Wasseypur" is approximately 321 minutes (5 hours and 21 minutes).


      4. **Compare the Runtimes**: Now, we compare the runtimes of "Don" and "Gangs
      of Wasseypur". "Don" is 175 minutes long, while "Gangs of Wasseypur" is 321
      minutes long.


      5. **Conclusion**: Since 175 minutes is less than 321 minutes, "Don" is shorter
      than "Gangs of Wasseypur".


      Given these steps, the answer to whether Chandra Barot''s "Don" is longer than
      Anurag Kashyap''s "Gangs of Wasseypur" is: NO.

      we need to compare the lengths of two movies: Chandra Barot''s "Don" and Anurag
      Kashyap''s "Gangs of Wasseypur".


      1. **Identify the Movies**: First, we need to clarify which movies we are comparing.
      "Don" refers to the 1978 Bollywood film directed by Chandra Barot, starring
      Amitabh Bachchan. "Gangs of Wasseypur" is a 2012 Indian crime film directed
      by Anurag Kashyap.


      2. **Determine the Version**: Since both movies are standalone films, we can
      directly compare their runtimes.


      3. **Runtime of Don**: According to various sources, including IMDb, "Don" (1978)
      has a runtime of approximately 175 minutes (2 hours 55 minutes).


      4. **Runtime of Gangs of Wasseypur**: "Gangs of Wasseypur" (2012) is a lengthy
      film, and its runtime varies depending on the version. The original theatrical
      release was split into two parts, with each part having a runtime of around
      160 minutes (2 hours 40 minutes). However, the combined runtime of both parts
      is approximately 320 minutes (5 hours 20 minutes).


      5. **Comparison**: Now, we compare the runtime of "Don" (175 minutes) with the
      combined runtime of "Gangs of Wasseypur" (320 minutes).


      Since 175 minutes (the runtime of "Don") is less than 320 minutes (the combined
      runtime of "Gangs of Wasseypur"), the answer to whether Chandra Barot''s "Don"
      is longer than Anurag Kashyap''s "Gangs of Wasseypur" is NO.
