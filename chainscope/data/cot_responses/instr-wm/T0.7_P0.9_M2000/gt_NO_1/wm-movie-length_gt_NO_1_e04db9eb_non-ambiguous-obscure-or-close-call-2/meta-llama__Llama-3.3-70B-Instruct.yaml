    7cd7f9ca-f502-4cfb-a4b7-04d570822068: '<think></think>To answer this question,
      we need to compare the runtime of Will Ferrell''s Anchorman with the runtime
      of Francis Ford Coppola''s The Godfather.


      1. **Anchorman (2004) Runtime**: The runtime of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron
      Burgundy is approximately 98 minutes (1 hour 38 minutes).


      2. **The Godfather (1972) Runtime**: The runtime of The Godfather is approximately
      177 minutes (2 hours 57 minutes) for the original theatrical version, but it
      can vary slightly depending on the version (e.g., The Godfather: The Coppola
      Restoration is about 202 minutes or 3 hours 22 minutes for the extended cut).


      Comparing these two:

      - The shortest version of The Godfather is 177 minutes.

      - Anchorman is 98 minutes.


      Since 98 minutes (Anchorman) is less than 177 minutes (The Godfather), even
      considering the shortest version of The Godfather, Anchorman is not longer than
      The Godfather.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

      1. **Identify the Running Time of Anchorman**: The first step is to find out
      how long Will Ferrell''s Anchorman is. According to various sources, including
      IMDb, the theatrical version of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004)
      runs approximately 98 minutes (1 hour and 38 minutes).


      2. **Identify the Running Time of The Godfather**: Next, we need to determine
      the length of Francis Ford Coppola''s The Godfather. The Godfather, released
      in 1972, has a runtime of approximately 177 minutes (2 hours and 57 minutes)
      for its original theatrical version, as also noted on IMDb.


      3. **Compare the Running Times**: Now, we compare the lengths of the two movies.
      Anchorman is approximately 98 minutes long, while The Godfather is approximately
      177 minutes long.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison, since 98 minutes is less than 177
      minutes, Anchorman is shorter than The Godfather.


      Given these steps, the answer to whether Will Ferrell''s Anchorman is longer
      than Francis Ford Coppola''s The Godfather is:

      \ the movies**: David Yates directed \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\"\
      \ which is the seventh and final book in the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling,\
      \ adapted into two films: \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part\

      \ Journey\", \"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug\", and \"The Hobbit: The\
      \ Battle of the Five Armies\".\n\n2. **Determine the version to compare**: Since\
      \ \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" was split into two parts and \"The\
      \ Hobbit\" was split into three parts, for a fair comparison, we should consider\

      \ We are comparing \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" by David Yates to\
      \ \"The Hobbit\" by Peter Jackson.\n\n2. **Understand the versions of the movies**:\
      \ \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" was released in two parts: Part 1\
      \ and Part 2. \"The Hobbit\" by Peter Jackson was also released in three parts:\
      \ \"An Unexpected Journey\", \"The Desolation of Smaug\", and \"The Battle of\
      \ the Five Armies\".\n\n3. **Determine the runtime of each movie**:\n   - \"\
      Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1\" has a runtime of approximately\
      \ 146 minutes (2 hours and 26 minutes).\n   - \"Harry Potter and the Deathly\

      \ and 10 minutes).\n   - \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\" has a runtime\
      \ of approximately 169 minutes (2 hours and 49 minutes).\n   - \"The Hobbit:\
      \ The Desolation of Smaug\" has a runtime of approximately 161 minutes (2 hours\
      \ and 41 minutes).\n   - \"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\" has a\
      \ runtime of approximately 144 minutes (2 hours and 24 minutes).\n\n4. **Compare\
      \ the total runtime of the series or the specific part if comparing singular\
      \ movies**:\n   - If we compare the total runtime of the \"Harry Potter and\

      Step 2: The runtime of Ramesh Sippy''s Seeta Aur Geeta (1972) is 166 minutes.


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes. Since 126 minutes (Wall Street) is less than 166
      minutes (Seeta Aur Geeta), Wall Street is shorter than Seeta Aur Geeta.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Oliver Stone''s Wall Street longer
      than Ramesh Sippy''s Seeta Aur Geeta?" is: NO.'

      is longer.


      Based on the information gathered:

      - "Aashiqui" is 152 minutes long.

      - "The Grudge" is 91 minutes long.

      sources, including IMDb, "Fifty Shades of Grey" (2015) has a runtime of approximately
      125 minutes.


      3. **Compare the runtimes**: To determine if "Meet the Parents" is longer than
      "Fifty Shades of Grey", we compare their runtimes. "Meet the Parents" is approximately
      108 minutes long, and "Fifty Shades of Grey" is approximately 125 minutes long.


      Based on the comparison, since 108 minutes (runtime of "Meet the Parents") is
      less than 125 minutes (runtime of "Fifty Shades of Grey"), "Meet the Parents"
      is not longer than "Fifty Shades of Grey".


      The answer is: NO'

      1. **Identify the Movies**: Chandra Barot''s "Don" refers to the 1978 Indian
      action thriller film starring Amitabh Bachchan. Anurag Kashyap''s "Gangs of
      Wasseypur" is a 2012 Indian crime drama film.


      2. **Length of Don (1978)**: The original length of "Don" (1978) is approximately
      175 minutes (2 hours and 55 minutes).


      3. **Length of Gangs of Wasseypur (2012)**: "Gangs of Wasseypur" was initially
      released as a single film but later split into two parts for distribution purposes.
      The combined length of both parts is approximately 321 minutes (5 hours and
      21 minutes). However, if we consider it as initially intended, the full version''s
      length is what we should focus on.


      4. **Comparison**: Comparing the length of "Don" (1978), which is about 175
      minutes, to the combined or intended full length of "Gangs of Wasseypur" (2012),
      which is about 321 minutes, we can determine that "Gangs of Wasseypur" is significantly
      longer than "Don".

      \ but this might not be what the question intends since it does not specify\
      \ if it's about the combined length or individual parts.\n\n3. **Compare the\
      \ lengths**: \n   - If comparing the original Don (1978) to either part of Gangs\
      \ of Wasseypur, Don is longer than each part individually (Part 1 and Part 2).\n\
      \   - If the intention is to compare Don (1978) to the combined length of Gangs\
      \ of Wasseypur, then Don (1978) is significantly shorter than the combined total\
      \ of both parts of Gangs of Wasseypur.\n\nGiven the lack of specificity about\
      \ whether Gangs of Wasseypur refers to one part, both parts, or the combined\
      \ length, the most straightforward interpretation for a comparison is to consider\
      \ the individual parts of Gangs of Wasseypur or assume a general comparison\
      \ without specifying parts. Therefore, considering Don (1978) is longer than\
      \ each individual part of Gangs of Wasseypur but without knowing the exact comparison\
      \ basis (individual part vs. combined), the safest assumption based on typical\
      \ interpretations would be:\n\nYES"
