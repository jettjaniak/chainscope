    7cd7f9ca-f502-4cfb-a4b7-04d570822068: 'To answer this question,
      we need to compare the runtime of Will Ferrell''s Anchorman with the runtime
      of Francis Ford Coppola''s The Godfather.


      1. **Anchorman (2004) Runtime**: The runtime of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron
      Burgundy is approximately 98 minutes (1 hour 38 minutes).


      2. **The Godfather (1972) Runtime**: The runtime of The Godfather is approximately
      177 minutes (2 hours 57 minutes) for the original theatrical version, but it
      can vary slightly depending on the version (e.g., The Godfather: The Coppola
      Restoration is about 202 minutes or 3 hours 22 minutes for the extended cut).


      Comparing these two:

      - The shortest version of The Godfather is 177 minutes.

      - Anchorman is 98 minutes.


      Since 98 minutes (Anchorman) is less than 177 minutes (The Godfather), even
      considering the shortest version of The Godfather, Anchorman is not longer than
      The Godfather.


      Therefore, the answer is: **NO**'

      IMDb, the theatrical version of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004)
      runs approximately 98 minutes (1 hour and 38 minutes).


      2. **Identify the Running Time of The Godfather**: Next, we need to determine
      the length of Francis Ford Coppola''s The Godfather. The Godfather, released
      in 1972, has a runtime of approximately 177 minutes (2 hours and 57 minutes)

      Anchorman is approximately 98 minutes long, while The Godfather is approximately
      177 minutes long.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison, since 98 minutes is less than 177
