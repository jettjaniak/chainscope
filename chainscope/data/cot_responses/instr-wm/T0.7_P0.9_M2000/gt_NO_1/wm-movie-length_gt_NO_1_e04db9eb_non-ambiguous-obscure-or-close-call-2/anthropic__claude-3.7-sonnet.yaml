      This refers to the Indian comedy film series that began with "Hera Pheri" (2000),

      runs approximately 156 minutes, and the sequel is about 154 minutes. Together,
      that''s roughly 310 minutes.


      3) Even if we were to consider both Anchorman films (94 minutes + 119 minutes

      58 minutes).

      - "Fifty Shades Freed" has a runtime of approximately 105 minutes (1 hour and
      45 minutes).


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes.

      - "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro" (132 minutes) is longer than both "Fifty Shades Darker"
      (118 minutes) and "Fifty Shades Freed" (105 minutes).


      YES, Kundan Shah''s "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro" is longer than James Foley''s "Fifty

      - "Fifty Shades" directed by James Foley (likely referring to "Fifty Shades
      of Grey" or one of its sequels)


      Step 2: Find the runtime of "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro".

      "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro" (1983) has a runtime of approximately 132 minutes (2 hours

      Step 3: Identify which "Fifty Shades" film directed by James Foley.

      James Foley directed "Fifty Shades Darker" and "Fifty Shades Freed" (not the

      - "Aradhana" is a Bollywood film with a runtime of approximately 169 minutes
      (2 hours and 49 minutes).

      by Anurag Kashyap.


      Step 1: Identify the runtime of Chandra Barot''s "Don" (1978).

      - "Don" has a runtime of approximately 166-175 minutes (around 2 hours and 45-55
      minutes).


      Step 2: Identify the runtime of Anurag Kashyap''s "Gangs of Wasseypur".

      - "Gangs of Wasseypur" was released as a two-part film.

      - Part 1 is approximately 160 minutes.

      - Part 2 is approximately 159 minutes.

      - Combined, the full "Gangs of Wasseypur" is about 319 minutes (over 5 hours).


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes.

      - "Don" is approximately 170 minutes.

      - "Gangs of Wasseypur" (both parts combined) is approximately 319 minutes.

      1) Chandra Barot''s "Don" is a 1978 Bollywood film starring Amitabh Bachchan.
      The typical runtime for mainstream Bollywood films of that era was around 2-3
      hours. Checking the specific runtime, "Don" (1978) has a runtime of approximately
      175 minutes (2 hours and 55 minutes).


      2) Anurag Kashyap''s "Gangs of Wasseypur" was released as a two-part film in
      2012. If we consider both parts together as the complete film, the total runtime
      is approximately 320 minutes (5 hours and 20 minutes). Part 1 is about 160 minutes
      and Part 2 is about 160 minutes.


      3) Comparing the two: "Don" is 175 minutes while "Gangs of Wasseypur" (both
      parts combined) is 320 minutes.


      4) Therefore, "Gangs of Wasseypur" is longer than "Don" by a significant margin
