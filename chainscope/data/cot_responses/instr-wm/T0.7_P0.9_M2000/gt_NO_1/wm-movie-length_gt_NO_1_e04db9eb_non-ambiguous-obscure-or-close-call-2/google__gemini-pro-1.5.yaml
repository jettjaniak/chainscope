      answer.


      However, since it''s highly likely the combined runtime of multiple movies is
      longer than a single movie, the answer is likely YES.  But with the information
      given, a perfectly accurate answer is impossible.  So, assuming the question

      2. **Determine the combined runtime of each series:** We need to find the runtime
      of each film in both series and add them together.  I don''t have access to
      real-time information, including movie runtimes.  I would need to look this
      up online.


      3. **Compare the combined runtimes:** Once the total runtimes are known, compare
      them to see which is longer.


      4. **Answer the question:** Based on the comparison, provide a YES or NO answer.


      Assuming I had the runtimes, I could then give a YES/NO answer.  Since I don''t,
      I can''t definitively answer the question right now.

      Potter and the Deathly Hallows:** This is actually two films: *Part 1* and *Part
      2*.  We need to consider their combined runtime.

      2. **Peter Jackson''s The Hobbit:** This is also a trilogy: *An Unexpected Journey*,
      *The Desolation of Smaug*, and *The Battle of the Five Armies*. We need to consider
      their combined runtime.

      3. **Compare the combined runtimes:**  We need to find the runtimes of all five
      films and compare the two sums.  I don''t have access to real-time information,
      including movie runtimes.  I cannot definitively answer without looking up these
      runtimes.


      However, generally speaking, the combined runtimes of the three Hobbit movies
      are significantly longer than the two Deathly Hallows movies.


      Therefore, assuming standard theatrical releases, my answer is likely **NO**.
