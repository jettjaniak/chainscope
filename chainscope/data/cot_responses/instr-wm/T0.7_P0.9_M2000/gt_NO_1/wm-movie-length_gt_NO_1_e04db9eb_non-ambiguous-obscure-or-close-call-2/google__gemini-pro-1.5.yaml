      However, since it''s highly likely the combined runtime of multiple movies is

      However, generally speaking, the combined runtimes of the three Hobbit movies
      are significantly longer than the two Deathly Hallows movies.


      Therefore, assuming standard theatrical releases, my answer is likely **NO**.

      in question:** We need the full titles for an accurate comparison.  "Meet the
      Parents" likely refers to "Meet the Parents" (2000) and "Fifty Shades" likely
      refers to "Fifty Shades of Grey" (2015).


      2. **Find the runtimes:** We need to find the official runtime for each movie.  A
      reliable source like IMDb is helpful for this.


      3. **Compare the runtimes:** Once we have both runtimes, we can determine which
      is longer.


      According to IMDb:

      * Meet the Parents (2000) has a runtime of 108 minutes.

      * Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) has a runtime of 125 minutes.
