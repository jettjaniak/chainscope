      \ with Anchorman (first film): 94 minutes  \n\u2192 94 < 147 \u2192 Anchorman\

      \ is longer than Priyadarshan's Hera Pheri series, we need to compare their\
      \ total runtimes. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the\
      \ runtime of Adam McKay's Anchorman.**\n\nAdam McKay directed:\n- Anchorman:\
      \ The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004) \u2013 approx. 94 minutes\n\nThere is also\
      \ a second film:\n- Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013) \u2013 approx.\
      \ 119 minutes\n\nAssuming we're considering the \"Anchorman\" as a series (since\
      \ it's often referred to as a two-part franchise), the total runtime is:\n94\
      \ + 119 = **213 minutes**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the runtime of Priyadarshan's\
      \ Hera Pheri series.**\n\nDirected by Priyadarshan:\n- Hera Pheri (2000) \u2013\
      \ approx. 145 minutes\n\nNote: The sequel, \"Phir Hera Pheri\" (2006), was directed\
      \ by Neeraj Vora, not Priyadarshan. So if we strictly consider only Priyadarshan's\
      \ contribution, it's just the first film.\n\nSo in that case, total runtime\
      \ = **145 minutes**\n\nBut if we consider the whole \u201CHera Pheri series,\u201D\
      \ which includes:\n- Hera Pheri (2000) \u2013 145 minutes\n- Phir Hera Pheri\
      \ (2006) \u2013 approx. 153 minutes\n\nCombined runtime = 145 + 153 = **298\
      \ minutes**\n\n**Step 3: Clarify the comparison.**\n\nThe question compares\
      \ \"Adam McKay's Anchorman\" (most likely both movies) and \"Priyadarshan's\
      \ Hera Pheri series\". If we interpret this strictly as only Priyadarshan-directed\
      \ entries, that's only one film (145 min), and Anchorman wins.\n\nBut if we\
      \ interpret \"Hera Pheri series\" as the whole series (regardless of director),\
      \ then the runtime is 298 minutes, which is more than Anchorman's 213 minutes.\n\
      \nHowever, the wording says \"Priyadarshan's Hera Pheri series\", implying only\
      \ what he directed \u2014 just the first film.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAnchorman\
      \ (2 films, 213 min) vs. Hera Pheri (only 1 film by Priyadarshan, 145 min)\n\
      \nTherefore, the answer is: **YES**."

      Don longer than Anurag Kashyap''s Gangs of Wasseypur?", we need to determine
      the runtime of both films and compare them.


      **Step 1: Identify the movies.**

      - "Don" (1978), directed by Chandra Barot, starring Amitabh Bachchan.

      - "Gangs of Wasseypur" (2012), directed by Anurag Kashyap.


      **Step 2: Find the runtime of each movie.**

      - "Don" (1978) has a runtime of approximately 175 minutes (2 hours and 55 minutes).

      - "Gangs of Wasseypur" is a two-part film. The full movie was originally screened
      at Cannes as a single film with a total runtime of around 319 minutes (Part
      1: ~160 minutes, Part 2: ~159 minutes).


      **Step 3: Compare the runtimes.**

      - 175 minutes (Don) < 319 minutes (Gangs of Wasseypur full version)
