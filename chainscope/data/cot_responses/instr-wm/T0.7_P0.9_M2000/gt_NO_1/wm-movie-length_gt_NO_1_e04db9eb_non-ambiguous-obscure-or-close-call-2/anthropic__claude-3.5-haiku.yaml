      \ (G\xE9rard Oury, 1966):\n\u2022 La Grande Vadrouille's runtime is 132 minutes\n\
      \n3. Compare the two runtimes:\n\u2022 The Waterboy: 90 minutes\n\u2022 La Grande\
      \ Vadrouille: 132 minutes\n\u2022 90 is less than 132\n\n4. Therefore, The Waterboy\
      \ is NOT longer than La Grande Vadrouille.\n\nNO"
