    ed05b30e-3c07-44cc-ba90-9ff7f99043fc: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll look up the population density of Compton, CA:

      - Compton''s area is about 10.1 square miles

      - Its population is around 96,000

      - This gives a population density of approximately 9,505 people per square mile


      2. Next, I''ll look up the population density of Bronx, NY:

      - The Bronx''s area is about 42 square miles

      - Its population is around 1.4 million

      - This gives a population density of approximately 33,333 people per square
      mile


      3. Comparing the two:

      - Bronx: 33,333 people per square mile

      - Compton: 9,505 people per square mile


      4. The Bronx has a significantly higher population density than Compton.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, Compton, CA is not more densely populated than
