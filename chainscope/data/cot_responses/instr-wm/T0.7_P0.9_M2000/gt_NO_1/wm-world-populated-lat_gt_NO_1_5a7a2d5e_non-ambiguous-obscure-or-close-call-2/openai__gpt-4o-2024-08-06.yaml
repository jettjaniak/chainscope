      the locations involved:


      1. **Australia, Cuba**: This seems to be a confusion or a mix-up of names, as
      there is no known place called "Australia" in Cuba. Australia is a country and
      continent, and Cuba is an island nation in the Caribbean.


      2. **Pyongyang**: This is the capital city of North Korea, located in East Asia.


      Now, assuming there was a place called "Australia" in Cuba, we need to compare
      the latitude of this place with Pyongyang:


      - Cuba is located in the Caribbean, which is well south of Pyongyang, North
      Korea. Pyongyang is situated around 39 degrees North latitude.

      - The northernmost point of Cuba is around 23 degrees North latitude.


      Given this, any location in Cuba would be south of Pyongyang.


      Therefore, the answer to the question, assuming "Australia, Cuba" refers to
      some location within Cuba, is:


      NO.'

      1. River Nile (state) refers to the River Nile State in Sudan, a country in
      northeastern Africa.

      2. Verona is a city located in northern Italy.


      Next, let''s consider their relative positions:


      - Sudan is situated in the northeastern part of Africa, while Italy is in southern
      Europe.

      - The latitude of River Nile State in Sudan is generally around 17 to 22 degrees
      north.

      - The latitude of Verona, Italy, is approximately 45 degrees north.


      Since 45 degrees north (Verona) is higher than 17 to 22 degrees north (River
      Nile State), Verona is located north of River Nile State.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, River Nile (state) is not located north of Verona.'

    5733406d-bda7-4f40-b67a-a058f7a4be88: 'To determine whether Mainland Australia
      is located north of Normandy, let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Locate Normandy:** Normandy is a region in northern France. It is situated
      at a latitude of approximately 49 degrees north.


      2. **Locate Mainland Australia:** Mainland Australia is a continent in the Southern
      Hemisphere. The northernmost point of mainland Australia, Cape York Peninsula,
      is at a latitude of approximately 10 degrees south.


      3. **Compare Latitudes:** Normandy, at 49 degrees north, is situated north of
      the equator, while the northernmost point of Mainland Australia is at 10 degrees
      south, meaning it is south of the equator.


      Based on this comparison, Mainland Australia is located south of Normandy.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
