      step:


      1. Bondi is a beach and suburb in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

      2. Sydney is located on the southeastern coast of Australia.

      3. Fukushima Prefecture is located in the Tohoku region of Japan, on the eastern
      coast of Honshu island.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions in terms of latitude (north-south
      positioning):


      4. Australia is located in the Southern Hemisphere.

      5. Japan is located in the Northern Hemisphere.


      Since Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere and Japan is in the Northern Hemisphere,
      any location in Australia (including Bondi) would be south of any location in
      Japan (including Fukushima Prefecture).


      Therefore, Bondi, New South Wales is NOT located north of Fukushima Prefecture.
      It is located south of Fukushima Prefecture.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine the relative north-south positions of these two locations
      by comparing their latitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Bondi is a beach suburb in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

      - Fukushima Prefecture is located in the northeastern region of Japan''s main
      island (Honshu).


      Step 2: Consider their hemispheric positions.

      - Australia is located entirely in the Southern Hemisphere.

      - Japan is located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere.


      Step 3: Compare latitudes.

      - Since Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere and Japan is in the Northern
      Hemisphere, any location in Australia (including Bondi) must be south of any
      location in Japan (including Fukushima Prefecture).

      - The equator separates the two locations, with Fukushima to the north of the
      equator and Bondi to the south.


      NO - Bondi, New South Wales is not located north of Fukushima Prefecture; it
      is located south of it.'
