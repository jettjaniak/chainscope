      than Kofi Annan. Therefore, the answer to whether Oskar Schindler died at a
      later date than Kofi Annan is:


      NO'

      1. **Richard I''s Death Date**: Richard I, also known as Richard the Lionheart,
      was the King of England from 1189 until his death on April 6, 1199.


      2. **Steve Jobs'' Death Date**: Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Inc., died
      on October 5, 2011.


      Now, comparing the two dates:


      - Richard I died on April 6, 1199.

      - Steve Jobs died on October 5, 2011.

      Therefore, the answer to whether Richard I died at a later date than Steve Jobs
      is: **NO**'
