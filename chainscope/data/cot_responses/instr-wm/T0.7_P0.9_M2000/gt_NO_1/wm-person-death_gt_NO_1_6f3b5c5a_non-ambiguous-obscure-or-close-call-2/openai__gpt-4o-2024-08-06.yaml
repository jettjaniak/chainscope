    dd3f8332-1a1c-4ed9-ab19-286eac058835: 'To determine whether Richard I died at
      a later date than Steve Jobs, we need to know the death dates of both individuals.


      1. Richard I, also known as Richard the Lionheart, was a King of England who
      died on April 6, 1199.

      2. Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Inc., passed away on October 5, 2011.


      Now, compare the two dates:


      - Richard I died in 1199.

      - Steve Jobs died in 2011.


      Therefore, Richard I did not die at a later date than Steve Jobs.


      The answer is: NO.'
