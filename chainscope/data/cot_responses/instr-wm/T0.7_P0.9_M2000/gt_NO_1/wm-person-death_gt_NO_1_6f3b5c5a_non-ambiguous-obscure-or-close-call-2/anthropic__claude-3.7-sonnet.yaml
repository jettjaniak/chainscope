      Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ) was the 36th President of the United States who took
      office after Kennedy''s assassination. He died on January 22, 1973, at his ranch
      in Texas from a heart attack.

      Orson Welles was a famous filmmaker, actor, and director known for works like
      "Citizen Kane." He died on October 10, 1985.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      LBJ died in 1973, while Orson Welles died in 1985.

      1985 is later than 1973, so Orson Welles died at a later date than Lyndon B.
      Johnson.

      Since Jimmy Carter hasn''t died yet (he''s still alive), and Catherine died
      in 1796, Jimmy Carter''s death would necessarily occur at a later date than
      Catherine''s.

      Step 1: Recall when Billy the Kid died.

      Billy the Kid (born Henry McCarty, also known as William H. Bonney) was a famous
      American outlaw in the American Old West. He died on July 14, 1881, when he
      was shot and killed by Sheriff Pat Garrett in Fort Sumner, New Mexico Territory.


      Step 2: Recall when Indira Gandhi died.

      Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister of India from 1966 to 1977 and again from
      1980 until her assassination. She was assassinated by her bodyguards on October
      31, 1984.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Billy the Kid died in 1881.

      Indira Gandhi died in 1984.

      1984 is later than 1881.


      Therefore, Indira Gandhi died at a later date than Billy the Kid.

      - Billy the Kid (William H. Bonney) was a notorious American outlaw in the American
      Old West.

      - He died on July 14, 1881, when he was shot and killed by Sheriff Pat Garrett
      in Fort Sumner, New Mexico.

      - Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister of India for several terms.

      - She was assassinated on October 31, 1984, by her bodyguards in New Delhi,
      India.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      - Billy the Kid died in 1881

      - Indira Gandhi died in 1984

      - 1984 is later than 1881 by 103 years


      Therefore, Indira Gandhi died at a later date than Billy the Kid, not the other
