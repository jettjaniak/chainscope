      period (771 to 476 BCE). The exact dates of his birth and death are not known,
      but it is traditionally believed that he wrote "The Art of War" around 500 BCE.
      For the sake of this question, let''s consider his death to be around or after
      500 BCE, assuming he wrote the book before he died.


      2. **Identify the birth and death dates of Paul Newman**: Paul Newman was born
      on January 26, 1925, and died on September 26, 2008.


      3. **Compare the death dates**: Given that Sun Tzu''s death date is not precisely
      known but is estimated to be sometime after 500 BCE, and Paul Newman died in
      2008, it is clear that Sun Tzu died more than 2,000 years before Paul Newman.


      Therefore, based on the comparison, the answer to the question "Did Sun Tzu
      die at a later date than Paul Newman?" is: **NO**.'

      we need to determine the dates of death for both Friedrich Nitzsch and Grigori
      Rasputin.


      1. **Identify Friedrich Nitzsch**: First, we need to identify who Friedrich
      Nitzsch is. After research, it appears that there might be confusion or a mix-up
      with the name, as a well-known historical figure related to the name is Friedrich
      Nietzsche, a German philosopher. However, assuming there''s a lesser-known figure
      or a different person named Friedrich Nitzsch, without more context, it''s challenging
      to provide an exact date of death. For the sake of this exercise, let''s proceed
      under the assumption that we''re discussing a historical figure named Friedrich
      Nitzsch, whose date of death we would need to establish.


      2. **Identify Grigori Rasputin**: Grigori Rasputin was a Russian mystic and
      faith healer who gained a significant influence over the Russian royal family,
      the Romanovs. His date of death is well-documented as December 29, 1916.


      3. **Compare Dates of Death**: To answer the question, we need to compare the
      dates of death. Given that we don''t have a confirmed date of death for Friedrich
      Nitzsch and assuming the possibility that he might not be a widely recognized
      historical figure under this name, let''s consider the known figure Friedrich
      Nietzsche, who died on August 25, 1900. If we were to mistakenly use Friedrich
      Nietzsche''s date of death for comparison, it would be before Rasputin''s. However,
      without the correct information on Friedrich Nitzsch, we can''t accurately compare.


      Given the information and the steps taken, and considering the possibility that
      Friedrich Nitzsch might not be a well-documented historical figure or could
      be a confusion with Friedrich Nietzsche, the answer would lean towards a hypothetical
      based on available data. If Friedrich Nitzsch died after 1916, the answer would
      be YES. If before, the answer would be NO. However, without a precise date for
      Friedrich Nitzsch, we must acknowledge the uncertainty.


      But since the question asks for a clear YES or NO and considering the most likely
      scenario where Friedrich Nitzsch could be confused with Friedrich Nietzsche
      (who died before Rasputin), the answer based on available and verifiable historical
      data would be:


      NO'

      1725. Peter the Great died on February 8, 1725.


      2. **Lee Harvey Oswald**: He is known for assassinating President John F. Kennedy

      - Kim Jong-il died on December 17, 2011.


      Given that 1790 is earlier than 2011, Adam Smith died at an earlier date than

      we need to determine the dates of death for both Ella Fitzgerald and Muammar
      Gaddafi and then compare them.


      1. **Ella Fitzgerald''s Date of Death**: Ella Fitzgerald, often referred to
      as the "First Lady of Song," was an American jazz singer. She passed away on
      June 15, 1996.


      2. **Muammar Gaddafi''s Date of Death**: Muammar Gaddafi, the Libyan politician
      and revolutionary, was the dictator of Libya from 1969 until his death in 2011.
      He died on October 20, 2011.


      Given these dates, we can compare them:


      - Ella Fitzgerald died on June 15, 1996.

      - Muammar Gaddafi died on October 20, 2011.


      Since 1996 is earlier than 2011, Ella Fitzgerald died at an earlier date than

      seized power and became the third President of Uganda, is known for his brutal
      regime. He died on August 16, 2003.


      Now, comparing the two dates:


      - Charles de Gaulle died on November 9, 1970.

      - Idi Amin died on August 16, 2003.


      Since 2003 is later than 1970, Idi Amin died at a later date than Charles de

      NO'

      and died on September 28, 1895.


      2. **Benito Mussolini''s Date of Death**: Benito Mussolini was an Italian politician
      and journalist who was the leader of the National Fascist Party. He ruled the
      country as Prime Minister from 1922 until he was overthrown in 1943 and then
      as "Duce" of Fascist Italy from 1943 until his death. Mussolini was born on
      July 29, 1883, and died on April 28, 1945.


      Given these dates, Louis Pasteur died on September 28, 1895, and Benito Mussolini
