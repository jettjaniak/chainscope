      the dates of death for both Friedrich Nitzsch and Grigori Rasputin.


      1. **Identify Friedrich Nitzsch**: First, we need to identify who Friedrich
      Nitzsch is. After research, it appears that there might be confusion or a mix-up
      with the name, as a well-known historical figure related to the name is Friedrich
      Nietzsche, a German philosopher. However, assuming there''s a lesser-known figure
      or a different person named Friedrich Nitzsch, without more context, it''s challenging
      to provide an exact date of death. For the sake of this exercise, let''s proceed
      under the assumption that we''re discussing a historical figure named Friedrich
      Nitzsch, whose date of death we would need to establish.


      2. **Identify Grigori Rasputin**: Grigori Rasputin was a Russian mystic and
      faith healer who gained a significant influence over the Russian royal family,
      the Romanovs. His date of death is well-documented as December 29, 1916.


      3. **Compare Dates of Death**: To answer the question, we need to compare the
      dates of death. Given that we don''t have a confirmed date of death for Friedrich
      Nitzsch and assuming the possibility that he might not be a widely recognized
      historical figure under this name, let''s consider the known figure Friedrich
      Nietzsche, who died on August 25, 1900. If we were to mistakenly use Friedrich
      Nietzsche''s date of death for comparison, it would be before Rasputin''s. However,
      without the correct information on Friedrich Nitzsch, we can''t accurately compare.


      Given the information and the steps taken, and considering the possibility that
      Friedrich Nitzsch might not be a well-documented historical figure or could
      be a confusion with Friedrich Nietzsche, the answer would lean towards a hypothetical
      based on available data. If Friedrich Nitzsch died after 1916, the answer would
      be YES. If before, the answer would be NO. However, without a precise date for
      Friedrich Nitzsch, we must acknowledge the uncertainty.


      But since the question asks for a clear YES or NO and considering the most likely
      scenario where Friedrich Nitzsch could be confused with Friedrich Nietzsche
      (who died before Rasputin), the answer based on available and verifiable historical
      data would be:


      NO'

      best known for his book "The Wealth of Nations," was born on June 5, 1723. He
      died on July 17, 1790.


      2. **Kim Jong-il''s Death Date**: Kim Jong-il, the Supreme Leader of the Democratic
      People''s Republic of Korea (North Korea) from 1994 to 2011, was born on February
      16, 1941 (or 1942, according to some sources). He died on December 17, 2011.


      Now, comparing the death dates:


      - Adam Smith died on July 17, 1790.

      - Kim Jong-il died on December 17, 2011.


      Given that 1790 is earlier than 2011, Adam Smith died at an earlier date than
      Kim Jong-il.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Adam Smith died at a later date than Kim Jong-il
      is: **NO**.'

      1. **Josef Mengele**: He was a German Schutzstaffel (SS) officer and a physician
      in Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. Mengele is known for his
      inhumane experiments on prisoners. After the war, he fled to South America,
      where he lived in hiding until his death. Josef Mengele died on February 7,

      II and later became President of France, died on November 9, 1970.

      the death dates of both Louis Pasteur and Benito Mussolini and then compare
      them.


      1. **Louis Pasteur''s Death Date**: Louis Pasteur was a French biologist, microbiologist,
      and chemist renowned for his vaccination discoveries. He died on September 28,
      1895.


      2. **Benito Mussolini''s Death Date**: Benito Mussolini was an Italian politician
      and the leader of the National Fascist Party, ruling as Prime Minister from
      1922 until he was ousted in 1943 and then as Duce of Italian Social Republic
      from 1943 until his death. He died on April 28, 1945.


      3. **Comparison**: Now, we compare the two dates. Louis Pasteur died on September
      28, 1895, and Benito Mussolini died on April 28, 1945.


      Given that 1895 is earlier than 1945, Louis Pasteur died at an earlier date
      than Benito Mussolini.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Louis Pasteur died at a later date than Benito
      Mussolini is: **NO**.'

      1. **Louis Pasteur**: He was a French chemist and microbiologist renowned for
      his discoveries of the principles of vaccination, microbial fermentation, and
      pasteurization. Louis Pasteur died on September 28, 1895.


      2. **Benito Mussolini**: He was an Italian politician and journalist who was
      the leader of the National Fascist Party. He ruled the country as Prime Minister
      from 1922 until he was ousted in 1943 and then as "Duce" of Italian Social Republic
      from 1943 until his death in 1945. Benito Mussolini died on April 28, 1945.


      Given these dates, we can compare them directly:


      - Louis Pasteur died on September 28, 1895.

      - Benito Mussolini died on April 28, 1945.


      Since 1895 is earlier than 1945, Louis Pasteur died at an earlier date than
      Benito Mussolini.


      The answer to the question "Did Louis Pasteur die at a later date than Benito
      Mussolini?" is therefore **NO**.'

      F. Kennedy.


      Therefore, the answer to the question, "Did Robert F. Kennedy die at a later
      date than Ferdinand Marcos?" is: **NO**'

      the dates of death for both historical figures.


      1. Richard I, also known as Richard the Lionheart, was King of England from
