      1. First, let me recall when Tesla died:

      - Nikola Tesla died on January 7, 1943


      2. Next, let me recall when Whitney Houston died:

      - Whitney Houston died on February 11, 2012

      - Since Tesla died in 1943 and Houston in 2012

      - Tesla died first, not later

      3. Now I can compare these dates

      - 1885 comes before 2020

      - Therefore Victor Hugo died earlier than Sean Connery


      4. The question asks if Hugo died later than Connery

      - Since Hugo died in 1885 and Connery in 2020, Hugo did not die later


      Answer: NO'

      1. First, let me recall when Alexander the Great died

      - Alexander the Great died in 323 BCE (Before Common Era)

      - He died at age 32 in Babylon


      2. Now, let me recall when Robert Mugabe died

      - Robert Mugabe died in 2019 CE (Common Era)

      - He died at age 95 in Singapore


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - 323 BCE is over 2,300 years before 2019 CE

      - Any date in CE/AD is later than any date in BCE/BC


      4. Therefore, since Mugabe died in 2019 CE and Alexander died in 323 BCE, Mugabe
      died much later.

      - Jesus: died around 30-33 CE

      - Austen: died in 1817 CE

      - 1817 CE is clearly later than 30-33 CE


      Answer: NO
