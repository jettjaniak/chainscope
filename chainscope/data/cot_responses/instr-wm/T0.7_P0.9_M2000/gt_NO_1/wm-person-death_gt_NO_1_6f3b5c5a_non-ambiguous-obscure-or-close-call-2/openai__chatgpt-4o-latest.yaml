      Step 1: Determine when Franklin Delano Roosevelt died.

      - FDR was the 32nd President of the United States. He died while still in office
      during World War II.

      - Historical records show that FDR died on April 12, 1945.

      Step 1: Determine when Louis Pasteur died.

      Louis Pasteur was a French scientist known for his discoveries in microbiology
      and vaccination. He died in the 19th century.

      - Louis Pasteur died in 1895.

      of death for both individuals and compare them.


      Step 1: Identify when Abu Bakr died.


      Abu Bakr was a prominent historical figure and the first Caliph of Islam after
      the death of the Prophet Muhammad. He died in the year 634 CE.


      Step 2: Identify when Nicholas II of Russia died.


      Nicholas II was the last Emperor (Tsar) of Russia. He was executed by the Bolsheviks
      during the Russian Revolution. His death occurred in 1918 CE.
