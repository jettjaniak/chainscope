      2. Next, let''s determine when Nelson Mandela died:

      - Nelson Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary

      - He died on December 5, 2013


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Mengele died in 1979

      - Mandela died in 2013

      - 2013 is later than 1979


      4. Therefore, Nelson Mandela died at a later date than Josef Mengele.


      The answer is: YES.'
    e81dae91-62f7-45f9-b361-228c945fd702: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, when did Josef Mengele die?

      - Josef Mengele died in 1979 in Brazil

      - He drowned while swimming and was buried under a false name


      2. Next, when did Nelson Mandela die?

      - Nelson Mandela died on December 5, 2013 in South Africa


      3. Comparing the dates:

      - Mengele died in 1979

      - Mandela died in 2013

      - 2013 is later than 1979


      4. Therefore, Mandela died at a later date than Mengele.


      The answer is: NO, Josef Mengele did not die at a later date than Nelson Mandela.'
