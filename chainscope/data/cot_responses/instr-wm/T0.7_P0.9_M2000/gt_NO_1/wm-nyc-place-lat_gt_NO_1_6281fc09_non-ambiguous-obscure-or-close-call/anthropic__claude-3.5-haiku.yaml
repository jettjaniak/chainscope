      - The medical center is around 34th to 40th Street

      - The reservoir is around 85th Street

      - So NYU Langone is definitely south of the reservoir


      4. Therefore, the answer to "Is NYU LANGONE MEDICAL CENTER, Manhattan located
      north of CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR SE, Manhattan?" is:


      NO'

      1. First, I''ll locate NYU Langone Medical Center

      - It is located in the Midtown East area of Manhattan

      - Its specific address is around 1st Avenue and 34th Street


      2. Next, I''ll locate Central Park Reservoir SE

      - The Central Park Reservoir is in the middle of Central Park

      - It''s near 33rd Street and 11th Avenue


      2. Next, locate GERSHWIN THEATRE:

      - The Gershwin Theatre is located in the Theater District

      - Its address is 222 West 51st Street, which is in Midtown Manhattan

      - It''s between Broadway and 8th Avenue


      3. Compare their north/south positions:

      - The Gershwin Theatre is at 51st Street

      - EDGE is near 33rd Street

      - 33rd Street is SOUTH of 51st Street


      4. Conclusion:

      Since EDGE is located at a lower (more southern) street number compared to the
      Gershwin Theatre, EDGE is SOUTH of the Gershwin Theatre.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'
