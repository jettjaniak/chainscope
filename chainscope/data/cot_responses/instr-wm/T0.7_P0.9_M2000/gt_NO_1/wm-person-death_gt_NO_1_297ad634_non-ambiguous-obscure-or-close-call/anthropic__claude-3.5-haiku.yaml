      - Osama bin Laden was killed by US special forces in Pakistan on May 2, 2011


      3. Comparing the two dates:

      - 1967 is earlier than 2011

      - This means Che Guevara died BEFORE Osama bin Laden


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      2. Who was Winston Churchill?

      - Winston Churchill was a British statesman who lived from 1874-1965

      - He was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during World War II


      3. Comparing their lifetimes:

      - Sun Tzu lived approximately 2,500 years before Churchill

      - Sun Tzu died around 496 BCE

      - Churchill died in 1965 CE


      4. Reasoning about who died later:

      - Churchill lived much later in history

      - Churchill died in 1965, which is significantly after Sun Tzu''s death in 496
      BCE


      5. Direct comparison of death dates:

      - He was born around 247 BCE and died around 183 BCE

      - This places him in the ancient world, in the 3rd-2nd century BCE

      - Sigmund Freud was an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis

      - He was born in 1856 and died in 1939
