      Wyoming is located east of Lake Erie in Ohio, we need to consider the geographical
      locations of both places:


      1. **Location of the Teton Range**: The Teton Range is located in the northwestern
      part of Wyoming, which is in the western United States.


      2. **Location of Lake Erie**: Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes located on
      the northern border of Ohio, which is in the northeastern part of the United
