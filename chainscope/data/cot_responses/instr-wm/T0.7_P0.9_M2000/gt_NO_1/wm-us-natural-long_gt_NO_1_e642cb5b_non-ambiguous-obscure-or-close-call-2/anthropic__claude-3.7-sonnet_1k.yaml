      to determine the relative locations of Teton Range, WY and Lake Erie, OH on
      an east-west axis.


      Let me think about the locations:

      1. Teton Range is in Wyoming (WY), which is in the western United States.

      2. Lake Erie is on the border of Ohio (OH), which is in the eastern/midwestern
      United States.


      In terms of the east-west geography of the US:

      - Western states include Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Nevada, Montana,
      Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, etc.

      - Eastern states include Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
      etc.


      Wyoming is definitely west of Ohio. Since the Teton Range is in Wyoming and
      Lake Erie borders Ohio, the Teton Range must be west of Lake Erie, not east
      of it.


      So, is Teton Range, WY located east of Lake Erie, OH? No, it''s the opposite
      - Teton Range is located west of Lake Erie.</think>I need to determine the relative
      east-west positions of these two geographic features.


      First, let me identify where each is located:

      - The Teton Range is located in Wyoming (WY), which is in the western United
      States

      - Lake Erie borders Ohio (OH), which is in the eastern/midwestern United States


      Looking at the geography of the United States:

      - Wyoming is significantly west of Ohio on any map of the US

      - The Teton Range is in western Wyoming, near the Idaho border

      - Lake Erie forms part of Ohio''s northern border


      Since Wyoming is west of Ohio, and the Teton Range is in Wyoming while Lake
      Erie borders Ohio, the Teton Range must be west of Lake Erie, not east of it.

      geographical relationship between two natural places in the US:

      1. Teton Range, Wyoming (WY)

      2. Lake Erie, Ohio (OH)


      Specifically, it''s asking if the Teton Range is located east of Lake Erie.


      Let me think about the general geographical layout of the United States:

      - Wyoming is in the western part of the continental US, in the Rocky Mountain
      region

      - Ohio is in the eastern/midwestern part of the continental US


      More specifically:

      - The Teton Range is in northwestern Wyoming, near the Idaho border

      - Lake Erie is on the northern border of Ohio, forming part of the border between
      the US and Canada


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Wyoming is definitely west of Ohio

      - Therefore, the Teton Range (in Wyoming) must be west of Lake Erie (in Ohio)


      Since the Teton Range is west of Lake Erie, it cannot be east of Lake Erie.</think>To
      determine if the Teton Range in Wyoming is located east of Lake Erie in Ohio,
      I need to consider the geographic positions of both locations within the United
      States.


      Step 1: Consider the locations of Wyoming and Ohio states.

      Wyoming is located in the western United States, in the Rocky Mountain region.

      Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest region.


      Step 2: More specifically locate the Teton Range and Lake Erie.

      The Teton Range is in northwestern Wyoming, near the Idaho border.

      Lake Erie forms part of Ohio''s northern border with Canada.


      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship.

      States in the western US (like Wyoming) are west of states in the Midwest/eastern
      US (like Ohio).

      Wyoming is significantly west of Ohio on any US map.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since the Teton Range is in Wyoming (western US) and Lake Erie borders Ohio
      (eastern/midwestern US), the Teton Range must be west of Lake Erie, not east
      of it.

      to consider the geographical locations of the Teton Range in Wyoming and Lake
      Erie in Ohio. Let me think about their relative positions in the United States.


      The Teton Range is located in western Wyoming, near the Idaho border. It''s
      part of the Rocky Mountains in the western United States.


      Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, and its shores touch Ohio on the south.
      Lake Erie is in the eastern part of the United States.


      In terms of east-west orientation in the US:

      - Western states (like Wyoming) are generally farther west

      - Eastern states (like Ohio) are generally farther east


      So the Teton Range in Wyoming would be west of Lake Erie in Ohio, not east of
      it.


      To be more specific about the directional relationship:

      - Wyoming is significantly west of Ohio

      - The Teton Range is in western Wyoming

      - Lake Erie is on the northern border of Ohio


      Therefore, the Teton Range is definitely located west of Lake Erie, not east
      of it.</think>I''ll solve this by thinking about the geographical locations
      of both places in the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - The Teton Range is located in western Wyoming (WY).

      - Lake Erie borders northern Ohio (OH).


      Step 2: Consider their positions within the United States.

      - Wyoming is located in the western portion of the United States.

      - Ohio is located in the eastern portion of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Wyoming is significantly west of Ohio on a map of the United States.

      - The Teton Range, being in western Wyoming, is even further west.

      - Lake Erie, bordering Ohio''s northern edge, is in the eastern part of the
      country.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Wyoming is west of Ohio, the Teton Range (in western Wyoming) must be
      west of Lake Erie (which borders Ohio), not east of it.

      Teton Range in Wyoming is located east of Lake Erie in Ohio.


      To figure this out, I''ll think about the general geographic locations:


      1. The Teton Range is in Wyoming, which is in the western part of the United
      States.

      2. Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, located in the northeastern/northern
      part of the United States, bordering Ohio.


      In terms of east-west positioning in the US:

      - Wyoming is significantly west of Ohio

      - The Teton Range is in western Wyoming

      - Lake Erie forms part of the northern border of Ohio

      Erie, not east of it.</think>I need to determine if the Teton Range in Wyoming
      is located east of Lake Erie in Ohio.


      Step 1: Consider the general locations of these places in the United States.

      - The Teton Range is in Wyoming, which is in the western part of the United
      States.

      - Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, located along the northern border of
      Ohio in the eastern/northeastern part of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Wyoming is significantly west of Ohio on the US map.

      - The western states (like Wyoming) are to the left (west) on US maps, while
      Ohio and the Great Lakes region are more to the right (east).


      Step 3: Make the final determination.

      - Since Wyoming is west of Ohio, and the Teton Range is within Wyoming, the
      Teton Range must be west of Lake Erie, not east of it.

      - Wyoming is located in the western United States, in the Rocky Mountain region.

      - Ohio is located in the eastern half of the United States, in the Midwest/Great
      Lakes region.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Wyoming is significantly west of Ohio.

      - The Teton Range, being in western Wyoming, is even further west compared to
      Lake Erie in Ohio.


      NO, the Teton Range in Wyoming is not located east of Lake Erie, Ohio. It is
