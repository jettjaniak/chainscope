      let''s break down the steps needed to determine if the Teton Range in Wyoming
      is located east of Lake Erie in Ohio.


      1. **Identify the locations**: The Teton Range is located in Wyoming, which
      is in the western United States. Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes and is
      located in the northeastern part of the United States, bordering the state of
      Ohio among others.


      2. **Consider geographical directions**: East and west are the key directions
      here. The United States can be divided roughly into eastern and western parts
      by the Mississippi River, with everything to the east of the river considered
      part of the eastern United States and everything to the west considered part
      of the western United States.


      3. **Compare locations**: Wyoming, where the Teton Range is located, is west
      of the Mississippi River and thus in the western United States. Lake Erie, being
      in Ohio, is east of the Mississippi River and thus in the eastern United States.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Wyoming (and therefore the Teton Range) is in
      the western United States and Lake Erie (in Ohio) is in the eastern United States,
      the Teton Range cannot be east of Lake Erie.
