    00d2a713-f0ee-4b1b-a6a9-307d91dbc9cf: 'I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of the Teton Range in Wyoming and Lake Erie in Ohio.


      Step 1: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Wyoming is located in the western United States, in the Rocky Mountain region.

      - Ohio is located in the eastern part of the Midwest, bordering the Great Lakes
      region.


      Step 2: More specifically, let''s think about their approximate longitudes.

      - The Teton Range is in western Wyoming, near the Idaho border.

      - Lake Erie borders northern Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and parts of Canada.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Wyoming is significantly west of Ohio on any US map.

      - The Teton Range, being in western Wyoming, is even further west.

      - Lake Erie, bordering eastern states, is much further east.


      Therefore, the Teton Range in Wyoming is located WEST of Lake Erie, not east
      of it.


      NO'
    248ae916-b8ad-41d1-87c4-05768e0cc095: 'I''ll think through this step by step.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations mentioned.

      - Teton Range is in Wyoming (WY), in the western United States.

      - Lake Erie is on the border of Ohio (OH), in the eastern part of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Wyoming is located in the western part of the country, in the Rocky Mountain
      region.

      - Ohio is located in the eastern part of the country, in the Great Lakes region.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions east-to-west.

      - States in the western US (like Wyoming) are west of states in the eastern
      US (like Ohio).

      - Therefore, the Teton Range in Wyoming would be west of Lake Erie in Ohio,
      not east of it.


      NO, the Teton Range, WY is not located east of Lake Erie, OH. It is located
      west of Lake Erie.'
    3e9286bd-e3a5-4388-9dab-cb14dac33530: 'I need to determine the relative positions
      of Teton Range, Wyoming and Lake Erie, Ohio to answer this question.


      Step 1: Recall the general geography of the United States.

      - Wyoming is located in the western part of the United States, in the Rocky
      Mountain region.

      - Ohio is located in the eastern part of the United States, in the Midwest/Great
      Lakes region.


      Step 2: Consider the specific locations.

      - The Teton Range is a mountain range in western Wyoming, near the Idaho border.

      - Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, bordering Ohio on its northern edge.


      Step 3: Compare east-west positions.

      - Wyoming is significantly west of Ohio on a map of the United States.

      - The Teton Range, being in western Wyoming, is even further west.

      - Lake Erie, on the northern border of Ohio, is in the eastern portion of the
      country.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Wyoming is west of Ohio, and the Teton Range is in western Wyoming,
      the Teton Range must be west of Lake Erie, not east of it.


      NO, the Teton Range, WY is not located east of Lake Erie, OH. It is located
      to the west.'

      - Teton Range is in Wyoming (WY), in the western United States.

      - Lake Erie is on the border of Ohio (OH), in the eastern part of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Wyoming is located in the western part of the continental US.

      - Ohio is located in the eastern part of the continental US.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Wyoming is significantly west of Ohio.

      - Therefore, the Teton Range (in Wyoming) must be west of Lake Erie (bordering
      Ohio).


      Step 4: Determine if Teton Range is east of Lake Erie.

      - Since the Teton Range is west of Lake Erie, it cannot be east of Lake Erie.


      NO, the Teton Range, WY is not located east of Lake Erie, OH. It is located
      west of Lake Erie.'
