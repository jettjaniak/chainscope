      \ Wyoming is located east of Lake Erie in Ohio, let's analyze the geographical\
      \ locations step by step.\n\n1. **Location of Teton Range, WY**:\n   - The Teton\
      \ Range is a mountain range in the western part of Wyoming.\n   - It is located\
      \ near the border with Idaho.\n   - The most well-known part of the range is\
      \ in Grand Teton National Park.\n\n2. **Location of Lake Erie, OH**:\n   - Lake\
      \ Erie is one of the Great Lakes and is located in the northeastern part of\
      \ Ohio.\n   - It forms part of the northern border of Ohio and touches states\
      \ like Pennsylvania, New York, and Michigan.\n\n3. **Relative Longitudinal Positions**:\n\
      \   - Longitude of the Teton Range (e.g., near Jackson, WY): approximately 110\xB0\
      W.\n   - Longitude of Lake Erie (e.g., near Cleveland, OH): approximately 81\xB0\
      W.\n\n4. **Geographical reasoning**:\n   - Since 110\xB0W is further west than\
      \ 81\xB0W, the Teton Range is clearly west of Lake Erie.\n\n**Final Answer**:\
      \ NO."

      \ Longitudes**:  \n   - The Teton Range (Jackson, WY) is approximately at longitude\
      \ 110\xB0W.\n   - Lake Erie (Cleveland, OH, as a reference point) is approximately\
      \ at longitude 81\xB0W.\n\n4. **Determine East vs. West**:  \n   Since 81\xB0\
      W (Lake Erie) is numerically less than 110\xB0W (Teton Range), Lake Erie is\
      \ to the east of the Teton Range.\n\nTherefore, the Teton Range is **west**\
