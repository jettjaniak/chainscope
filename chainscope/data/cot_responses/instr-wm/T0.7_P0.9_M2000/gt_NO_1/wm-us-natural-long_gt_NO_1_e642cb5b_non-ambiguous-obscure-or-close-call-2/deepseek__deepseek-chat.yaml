    08003b39-0d7c-427e-b2de-66e5a0614b95: 'To answer this question,
      let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Locate the Teton Range, WY**: The Teton Range is a mountain range in northwestern
      Wyoming, part of the Rocky Mountains. It is located in the western United States.


      2. **Locate Lake Erie, OH**: Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, situated in
      the northeastern part of the United States. The city of Cleveland, Ohio, is
      on its southern shore.


      3. **Compare their relative positions**: The Teton Range is in the western U.S.,
      while Lake Erie is in the eastern U.S. Specifically, the Teton Range is significantly
      west of Lake Erie.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since the Teton Range is west of Lake Erie, it is **not**
      located east of Lake Erie.

    0bd09392-283b-48f9-8f5d-3e8d8f1e4bbe: 'To determine whether the
      Teton Range in Wyoming is located east of Lake Erie in Ohio, let''s break this
      down step by step:


      1. **Locate the Teton Range, WY**: The Teton Range is in western Wyoming, near
      the border with Idaho. It is part of the Rocky Mountains and is located in the
      western United States.


      2. **Locate Lake Erie, OH**: Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes and is situated
      in the northeastern part of the United States. It borders Ohio to the south,
      as well as Pennsylvania, New York, and Michigan.


      3. **Compare their longitudinal positions**: The Teton Range is significantly
      farther west than Lake Erie. Wyoming is in the Mountain Time Zone, while Ohio
      is in the Eastern Time Zone, indicating a substantial east-west separation.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since the Teton Range is in the western United States and
      Lake Erie is in the northeastern United States, the Teton Range is **not** east
      of Lake Erie.
