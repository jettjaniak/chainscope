      we need to understand the geographical locations of the Teton Range, WY, and
      Lake Erie, OH. Here''s a step-by-step approach:


      1. **Identify the locations**: The Teton Range is located in Wyoming (WY), which
      is a state in the western United States. Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes
      and is located in the state of Ohio (OH), which is in the eastern part of the
      United States.


      2. **Understand the geographical positions**: Wyoming is generally considered
      to be part of the Western United States, while Ohio is part of the Eastern United
      States.


      3. **Compare their positions**: Given that the Teton Range is in Wyoming, which
      is in the Western United States, and Lake Erie is in Ohio, which is in the Eastern
      United States, the Teton Range cannot be located east of Lake Erie.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: **NO**'
