      \nFirst, I need to find out when each song was released.\n\n- **Spice Girls's\
      \ \"Wannabe\":**\n  - I recall that the Spice Girls were very popular in the\
      \ 1990s.\n  - A quick search confirms that \"Wannabe\" was released on July\
      \ 8, 1996.\n\n- **Tyga's \"Rack City\":**\n  - Tyga is a more recent artist\
      \ compared to the Spice Girls.\n  - Upon checking, I find that \"Rack City\"\
      \ was released on December 20, 2011.\n\n### Step 2: Compare the Release Dates\n\
      \nNow that I have both release dates:\n\n- **\"Wannabe\"** \u2013 July 8, 1996\n\
      - **\"Rack City\"** \u2013 December 20, 2011\n\n### Step 3: Determine Which\
      \ Song Was Released Later\n\nComparing the two dates:\n\n- 1996 is earlier than\
      \ 2011.\n- Therefore, \"Wannabe\" was released **before** \"Rack City.\"\n\n\
      ### Step 4: Answer the Question\n\nThe question asks: *Was Spice Girls's \"\
      Wannabe\" released later than Tyga's \"Rack City\"?*\n\nBased on the release\
      \ dates:\n\n- **\"Wannabe\"** (1996) was released **before** **\"Rack City\"\

    03214fd6-595b-4ae7-a625-b2f9a9c57dcd: 'Alright, let''s tackle this question step
      by step to determine whether Elton John''s *Candle in the Wind* was released
      later than Martin Garrix''s *Scared to Be Lonely*. Here''s how I''m approaching
      it:


      ### Step 1: Identify the Release Dates


      First, I need to find out the release dates for both songs.


      - **Elton John''s *Candle in the Wind***: There are actually two versions of
      this song. The original was released in 1973 as part of the *Goodbye Yellow
      Brick Road* album. A newer version, titled *Candle in the Wind 1997*, was released
      in 1997 as a tribute to Princess Diana.


      - **Martin Garrix''s *Scared to Be Lonely***: This song was released on January
      27, 2017.


      ### Step 2: Compare the Release Dates


      Now, let''s compare the most relevant versions:


      - **Original *Candle in the Wind*** (1973) vs. *Scared to Be Lonely* (2017):
      Clearly, 1973 is much earlier than 2017.


      - **Candle in the Wind 1997** (1997) vs. *Scared to Be Lonely* (2017): Here,
      1997 is earlier than 2017.


      ### Step 3: Determine Which Version of *Candle in the Wind* is Being Referred
      To


      Since the question doesn''t specify which version of *Candle in the Wind* it''s
      referring to, we should consider both:


      1. If it''s the original version from 1973, then it was released much earlier
      than *Scared to Be Lonely*.

      2. If it''s the 1997 version, it was still released earlier than *Scared to
      Be Lonely*.


      ### Step 4: Conclusion


      In both cases, *Candle in the Wind* was released before *Scared to Be Lonely*.
      Therefore, **NO**, Elton John''s *Candle in the Wind* was not released later
      than Martin Garrix''s *Scared to Be Lonely*.

    0b1cdb3d-f0af-4da4-911a-1a7c2588bf06: 'Alright, let''s tackle this question step
      by step to determine whether Diana Ross''s "I''m Coming Out" was released later
      than Halsey''s "Without Me." To find the answer, we''ll need to establish the
      release dates of both songs and compare them.


      ### Step 1: Identify the Artist and Song Titles


      First, let''s make sure we have the correct songs and artists:


      - **Diana Ross''s "I''m Coming Out"**

      - **Halsey''s "Without Me"**


      Both are famous songs by renowned artists, so there should be reliable information
      available about their release dates.


      ### Step 2: Find the Release Date of Diana Ross''s "I''m Coming Out"


      I recall that Diana Ross is a legendary singer who was prominent in the 1970s
      and 1980s. "I''m Coming Out" is one of her well-known tracks. To find its exact
      release date, I''ll search for it.


      After a quick search, I find that "I''m Coming Out" was released as a single
      in **1980**. It was part of her album "Diana," which came out in May 1980.


      ### Step 3: Find the Release Date of Halsey''s "Without Me"


      Halsey is a more contemporary artist, gaining popularity in the 2010s. "Without
      Me" is one of her hit songs. Let''s look up its release date.


      Upon searching, I discover that "Without Me" was released as a single on **October
      4, 2018**. It''s from her album "Manic," which was released later, in January
      2020.


      ### Step 4: Compare the Release Dates


      Now that we have both release dates:


      - **Diana Ross''s "I''m Coming Out"**: 1980

      - **Halsey''s "Without Me"**: October 4, 2018


      Clearly, 1980 is much earlier than 2018.


      ### Step 5: Answer the Question


      The question asks: **Was Diana Ross''s "I''m Coming Out" released later than
      Halsey''s "Without Me"?**


      Given that "I''m Coming Out" was released in 1980 and "Without Me" in 2018,
      the answer is:


      **NO**, Diana Ross''s "I''m Coming Out" was not released later than Halsey''s
      "Without Me." In fact, it was released **earlier**.


      ### Additional Verification


      To ensure accuracy, let''s verify the release dates one more time:


      - **"I''m Coming Out" by Diana Ross**: Confirmed release in 1980.

      - **"Without Me" by Halsey**: Confirmed release on October 4, 2018.


      The information remains consistent, reinforcing that "I''m Coming Out" came
      out well before "Without Me."


      ### Conclusion


      After carefully researching and comparing the release dates of both songs, it''s
      clear that Diana Ross''s "I''m Coming Out" predates Halsey''s "Without Me" by
      several decades. Therefore, the answer to the question is a definitive **NO**.

    cce536d6-9132-430f-9025-c789b49f90a5: 'Alright, let''s tackle this question step
      by step. The goal is to determine whether The Beatles'' song "I Feel Fine" was
      released later than U2''s "I Still Haven''t Found What I''m Looking For." To
      answer this, we''ll need to find the release dates of both songs and compare
      them.


      ### Step 1: Identify the Artists and Songs


      First, let''s confirm the artists and the songs in question:


      - **The Beatles** are a legendary British rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960.

      - **"I Feel Fine"** is one of their famous songs.

      - **U2** is an Irish rock band formed in Dublin in 1976.

      - **"I Still Haven''t Found What I''m Looking For"** is one of their well-known
      tracks.


      ### Step 2: Find the Release Date of "I Feel Fine" by The Beatles


      Let''s look up when "I Feel Fine" was released.


      Upon researching, I find that "I Feel Fine" was released as a single by The
      Beatles on **November 27, 1964**. This song was included in their album "Beatles
      for Sale," which came out in December 1964.


      ### Step 3: Find the Release Date of "I Still Haven''t Found What I''m Looking
      For" by U2


      Now, let''s determine the release date of U2''s "I Still Haven''t Found What
      I''m Looking For."


      After checking, I discover that this song was released as part of U2''s album
      "The Joshua Tree," which was released on **March 9, 1987**. The single itself
      was released later in the same year.


      ### Step 4: Compare the Release Dates


      Now that we have both release dates:


      - **"I Feel Fine"** by The Beatles: **November 27, 1964**

      - **"I Still Haven''t Found What I''m Looking For"** by U2: **March 9, 1987**


      To determine which song was released later, we compare the years first:


      - 1964 vs. 1987


      Clearly, 1987 is much later than 1964.


      ### Step 5: Conclusion


      Based on the release dates:


      - **"I Feel Fine"** was released in **1964**.

      - **"I Still Haven''t Found What I''m Looking For"** was released in **1987**.


      Since 1987 is later than 1964, it means that **"I Still Haven''t Found What
      I''m Looking For"** by U2 was released **later** than **"I Feel Fine"** by The
      Beatles.


      ### Final Answer


      **NO**, The Beatles'' "I Feel Fine" was **not** released later than U2''s "I
      Still Haven''t Found What I''m Looking For." In fact, "I Feel Fine" was released
      in 1964, which is earlier than "I Still Haven''t Found What I''m Looking For,"
      released in 1987.'

      by step to determine whether Baha Men''s "Who Let the Dogs Out" was released
      later than Gwen Stefani''s "Hollaback Girl."


      ### Step 1: Identify the Release Dates


      First, I need to find out the exact release dates for both songs.


      #### Baha Men''s "Who Let the Dogs Out"


      I recall that "Who Let the Dogs Out" became a big hit in the early 2000s. Upon
      checking, I find that it was released in **July 2000** as part of their album
      "Who Let the Dogs Out."


      #### Gwen Stefani''s "Hollaback Girl"


      "Hollaback Girl" is a well-known song by Gwen Stefani. I believe it came out
      in the mid-2000s. A quick search reveals that it was released in **March 2005**
      as part of her debut solo album "Love. Angel. Music. Baby."


      ### Step 2: Compare the Release Dates


      Now that I have the release dates:


      - **"Who Let the Dogs Out"**: July 2000

      - **"Hollaback Girl"**: March 2005


      Comparing these dates, it''s clear that "Who Let the Dogs Out" was released
      **before** "Hollaback Girl."


      ### Step 3: Answer the Question


      The question asks: **Was Baha Men''s "Who Let the Dogs Out" released later than
      Gwen Stefani''s "Hollaback Girl"?**


      Given that "Who Let the Dogs Out" came out in July 2000 and "Hollaback Girl"
      in March 2005, the answer is:


      **NO**, Baha Men''s "Who Let the Dogs Out" was not released later than Gwen
      Stefani''s "Hollaback Girl."'

      \ the Artists and Songs\nFirst, I need to make sure I have the correct artists\
      \ and songs in mind:\n- **Auli\u02BBi Cravalho** is known for her role as the\
      \ voice of Moana in Disney's animated film \"Moana.\" Her song \"How Far I'll\
      \ Go\" is one of the main tracks from the movie.\n- **Post Malone** is a contemporary\
      \ artist known for his blend of hip-hop, pop, and rock. \"Take What You Want\"\
      \ is one of his popular songs.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Release Dates\n\
      Next, I need to find out when each song was released.\n\n#### Auli\u02BBi Cravalho's\
      \ \"How Far I'll Go\"\n- \"Moana\" was released in **November 2016**.\n- Therefore,\
      \ \"How Far I'll Go\" was likely released around the same time, possibly in\

      - \"Take What You Want\" was released in **August 2019**.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\
      Since **November 2016** (the release of \"How Far I'll Go\") is earlier than\

      \ released later than Post Malone's 'Take What You Want'?\"** To answer this,\
      \ we'll need to determine the release dates of both songs and compare them.\n\
      \n### Step 1: Identify the Artists and Songs\nFirst, let's confirm who the artists\
      \ are and what songs we're dealing with.\n\n- **Auli\u02BBi Cravalho** is a\
      \ singer and actress known for voicing the character Moana in Disney's animated\
      \ film *Moana*. One of her notable songs from the movie is **\"How Far I'll\
      \ Go.\"**\n  \n- **Post Malone** is a well-known American rapper, singer, and\
      \ songwriter. One of his popular songs is **\"Take What You Want,\"** featuring\
      \ Ozzy Osbourne and Travis Scott.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Release Date of \"\
      How Far I'll Go\"\nNext, we need to find out when **\"How Far I'll Go\"** was\
      \ released. Since it's from the *Moana* movie soundtrack, we can look up the\
      \ release date of the movie or the soundtrack.\n\nAfter a quick search:\n- The\
      \ Disney animated film *Moana* was released on **November 23, 2016**.\n  \n\
      Therefore, **\"How Far I'll Go\"** was likely released around this date as part\
      \ of the movie's soundtrack.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Release Date of \"Take\
      \ What You Want\"\nNow, let's find out when **\"Take What You Want\"** was released.\
      \ This song is part of Post Malone's album.\n\nAfter searching:\n- Post Malone's\
      \ album *Hollywood's Bleeding*, which includes the song **\"Take What You Want,\"\
      ** was released on **September 6, 2019**.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Release\
      \ Dates\nNow that we have both release dates:\n- **\"How Far I'll Go\"**: November\
      \ 23, 2016\n- **\"Take What You Want\"**: September 6, 2019\n\n### Step 5: Determine\
      \ Which Song Was Released Later\nComparing the two dates:\n- November 23, 2016\
      \ (How Far I'll Go) is **earlier** than September 6, 2019 (Take What You Want).\n\
      \nTherefore, **\"Take What You Want\"** was released **later** than **\"How\
      \ Far I'll Go.\"**\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the release dates:\n- **\"How\
      \ Far I'll Go\"** was released on November 23, 2016.\n- **\"Take What You Want\"\
      ** was released on September 6, 2019.\n\nSince November 23, 2016, is earlier\
      \ than September 6, 2019, the answer to the question is:\n\n**NO**, Auli\u02BB\
      i Cravalho's \"How Far I'll Go\" was **not** released later than Post Malone's\
      \ \"Take What You Want.\" In fact, it was released earlier."

    b944d9f3-123e-4dd9-a6b2-15f50d2b9db0: 'Alright, let''s tackle this question step
      by step. We need to determine whether Hank Williams''s "Hey, Good Lookin''"
      was released later than Gunna''s "Drip Too Hard." To do this, we''ll need to
      find the release dates of both songs and compare them.


      ### Step 1: Identify the Release Date of Hank Williams''s "Hey, Good Lookin''"


      First, let''s find out when Hank Williams''s "Hey, Good Lookin''" was released.
      Hank Williams was a country music singer-songwriter who was active in the 1940s
      and 1950s.


      Upon researching, I found that "Hey, Good Lookin''" was released in **1951**.
      This song became one of Hank Williams''s most famous hits and is considered
      a classic in country music.


      ### Step 2: Identify the Release Date of Gunna''s "Drip Too Hard"


      Next, we need to determine when Gunna''s "Drip Too Hard" was released. Gunna
      is a contemporary rapper, and "Drip Too Hard" is a popular song featuring Lil
      Baby.


      After checking, I discovered that "Drip Too Hard" was released on **October
      5, 2018**. This song was part of Gunna''s collaborative album with Lil Baby
      titled *Drip Harder*.


      ### Step 3: Compare the Release Dates


      Now that we have both release dates:


      - **Hank Williams''s "Hey, Good Lookin''":** 1951

      - **Gunna''s "Drip Too Hard":** October 5, 2018


      Clearly, 1951 is much earlier than 2018. Therefore, Hank Williams''s "Hey, Good
      Lookin''" was released **before** Gunna''s "Drip Too Hard."


      ### Conclusion


      Based on the release dates:


      - **Hank Williams''s "Hey, Good Lookin''" (1951)**

      - **Gunna''s "Drip Too Hard" (2018)**


      **No**, Hank Williams''s "Hey, Good Lookin''" was not released later than Gunna''s
      "Drip Too Hard." It was released much earlier.


      **Final Answer:** NO.'

      \ by step to determine whether Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Sweet Home Alabama\" was released\
      \ later than The Cure's \"Boys Don't Cry.\"\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Release\
      \ Dates\n\nFirst, we need to find out the release dates of both songs.\n\n-\
      \ **Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Sweet Home Alabama\"**: This song is a classic rock anthem.\
      \ I recall that Lynyrd Skynyrd was active in the 1970s, and \"Sweet Home Alabama\"\
      \ is one of their most famous tracks.\n  \n- **The Cure's \"Boys Don't Cry\"\
      **: The Cure is a British rock band known for their contributions to the post-punk\
      \ and new wave genres. I believe \"Boys Don't Cry\" is one of their early hits.\n\
      \n### Step 2: Research the Release Dates\n\nLet's look up the exact release\
      \ dates for both songs.\n\n#### Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Sweet Home Alabama\"\n\n\
      Upon checking, I find that \"Sweet Home Alabama\" was released in **1974**.\
      \ It was included in their second studio album, \"Second Helping.\"\n\n####\
      \ The Cure's \"Boys Don't Cry\"\n\nResearching \"Boys Don't Cry,\" I see that\
      \ the song was originally released in **1979**. It was part of their debut album,\
      \ which was also titled \"Boys Don't Cry.\"\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Release\
      \ Dates\n\nNow, let's compare the two release dates:\n\n- **Lynyrd Skynyrd's\
      \ \"Sweet Home Alabama\"**: 1974\n- **The Cure's \"Boys Don't Cry\"**: 1979\n\
      \n### Step 4: Determine Which Song Was Released Later\n\nComparing the two dates:\n\
      - 1974 (Sweet Home Alabama) is earlier than 1979 (Boys Don't Cry).\n\nTherefore,\
      \ \"Sweet Home Alabama\" was released **before** \"Boys Don't Cry.\"\n\n###\
      \ Conclusion\n\nBased on the release dates:\n- **Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Sweet Home\
      \ Alabama\"**: 1974\n- **The Cure's \"Boys Don't Cry\"**: 1979\n\n**No**, Lynyrd\
      \ Skynyrd's \"Sweet Home Alabama\" was not released later than The Cure's \"\
      Boys Don't Cry.\"\n\n**Final Answer:** NO"

    e633c711-8429-4721-b086-b8de027ab82a: 'Alright, let''s tackle this question step
      by step. The goal is to determine whether Dido''s "White Flag" was released
      later than BTS''s "Save Me." To do this, we''ll need to find the release dates
      of both songs and compare them.


      ### Step 1: Identify the Artists and Songs


      First, let''s confirm who Dido and BTS are, as well as the songs in question.


      - **Dido**: She''s a British singer-songwriter known for her melodic pop and
      folk-influenced music.

      - **BTS**: They are a South Korean boy band that has gained massive international
      popularity, blending elements of pop, hip-hop, and R&B.


      The songs we''re focusing on are:

      - **"White Flag"** by Dido

      - **"Save Me"** by BTS


      ### Step 2: Find the Release Date of Dido''s "White Flag"


      Let''s start by determining when Dido''s "White Flag" was released.


      After a quick search, I find that "White Flag" is a song from Dido''s second
      studio album, **"Life for Rent."** This album was released on **September 29,
      2003**. "White Flag" was also released as the album''s lead single.


      So, **"White Flag" by Dido was released on September 29, 2003**.


      ### Step 3: Find the Release Date of BTS''s "Save Me"


      Next, we need to find out when BTS''s "Save Me" was released.


      BTS has a extensive discography, so I''ll look up the specific release date
      for "Save Me."


      Upon researching, I discover that "Save Me" is a track from BTS''s **second
      studio album, "Wings,"** which was released on **October 10, 2016**. "Save Me"
      was also released as a music video on **May 15, 2016** as part of their **"The
      Most Beautiful Moment in Life" series**.


      So, **"Save Me" by BTS was released on May 15, 2016**.


      ### Step 4: Compare the Release Dates


      Now that we have both release dates:


      - **Dido''s "White Flag"**: September 29, 2003

      - **BTS''s "Save Me"**: May 15, 2016


      To determine whether "White Flag" was released later than "Save Me," we compare
      the years first.


      - 2003 (Dido) vs. 2016 (BTS)


      Since 2016 is later than 2003, it''s clear that "Save Me" was released after
      "White Flag."


      ### Step 5: Conclusion


      Based on the release dates:


      - "White Flag" by Dido: September 29, 2003

      - "Save Me" by BTS: May 15, 2016


      **"White Flag" was released earlier than "Save Me."** Therefore, the answer
      to the question "Was Dido''s White Flag released later than BTS''s Save Me?"
      is:


      **NO.**'
