      part of Dire Straits'' album "Brothers in Arms." It became a massive hit and
      is considered one of their most iconic songs.


      2. **Taylor Swift - "Cardigan":** "Cardigan" is a song by Taylor Swift that
      was released in 2020 as part of her album "Folklore." It marked a departure
      from her previous pop sound and showcased a more introspective and acoustic
      style.


      Given these release dates:


      - Dire Straits''s "Money for Nothing" was released in **1985**.

      - Taylor Swift''s "Cardigan" was released in **2020**.
