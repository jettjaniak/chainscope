      Step 1: Determine the release date of Elton John''s "Candle in the Wind".


      - "Candle in the Wind" was originally released in 1973 as a tribute to Marilyn
      Monroe.

      - A re-recorded version, "Candle in the Wind 1997", was released in 1997 as
      a tribute to Princess Diana.


      So the most recent release of this song is 1997.


      Step 2: Determine the release date of Martin Garrix''s "Scared to Be Lonely".


      - "Scared to Be Lonely" by Martin Garrix and Dua Lipa was released in January
      2017.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.


      - "Candle in the Wind" (latest version): 1997

      - "Scared to Be Lonely": 2017


      Since 1997 is earlier than 2017, "Candle in the Wind" was released before "Scared

    a1f4e86d-4500-4f23-9428-966aac84ebb4: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the release dates of both songs and compare them.


      Step 1: Determine the release date of TLC''s "Waterfalls".

      - "Waterfalls" is a song by the American girl group TLC.

      - It was released as a single from their second album "CrazySexyCool".

      - The album was released in 1994, and "Waterfalls" was released as a single
      in 1995.


      Step 2: Determine the release date of Lil Nas X''s "Old Town Road".

      - "Old Town Road" is a song by American rapper Lil Nas X.

      - It was initially released independently in December 2018.

      - It gained popularity in early 2019 and was officially re-released through
      Columbia Records in March 2019.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      - "Waterfalls": Released in 1995.

      - "Old Town Road": Released in 2018 (initial release) and re-released in 2019.


      Now, compare the years: 1995 (Waterfalls) vs. 2018/2019 (Old Town Road).


      Since 1995 is earlier than both 2018 and 2019, "Waterfalls" was released earlier.

      Step 1: Determine the release date of Black Sabbath''s "Paranoid".

      - "Paranoid" is a song by the British heavy metal band Black Sabbath.

      - It was released in 1970 as the title track of their second studio album, also
      called "Paranoid".


      Step 2: Determine the release date of Biz Markie''s "Just a Friend".

      - "Just a Friend" is a song by American rapper Biz Markie.

      - It was released in 1989 as a single from his album "The Biz Never Sleeps".


      Step 3: Compare the two release dates.

      Step 1: Identify the release date of "Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya".

      - "Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya" is a famous song from the Bollywood film "Mughal-e-Azam".

      - "Mughal-e-Azam" was released in 1960.

      - So, the song "Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya" was released in 1960.


      Step 2: Identify the release date of "Champagne Supernova" by Oasis.

      - "Champagne Supernova" is a song from the album "(What''s the Story) Morning
      Glory?" by the British rock band Oasis.

      - The album was released in 1995.

      - "Champagne Supernova" was released as a single in 1996.


      Step 3: Compare the two release dates.

      - "Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya": 1960

      - "Champagne Supernova": 1996


      Conclusion: 1960 is earlier than 1996, so "Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya" was released
      earlier than "Champagne Supernova".
