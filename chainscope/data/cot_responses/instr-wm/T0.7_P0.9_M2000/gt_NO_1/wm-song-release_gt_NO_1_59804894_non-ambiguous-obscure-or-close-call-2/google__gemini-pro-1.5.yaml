      Diana.  The later version is generally what people refer to when discussing
      the song.


      2. **Scared to Be Lonely** by Martin Garrix was released in 2017.

      Candle in the Wind 1997 (re-written version)** -  There are two versions of
      Elton John''s "Candle in the Wind". The original was released in 1973.  A rewritten
      version, "Candle in the Wind 1997" (also known as "Goodbye England''s Rose"),
      was released in 1997.  This is the more commonly known version nowadays.


      2. **Scared to Be Lonely (2017)** - Martin Garrix''s "Scared to Be Lonely" was
      released in 2017.
