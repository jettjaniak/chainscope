      has two prominent releases: the original in 1973 and the rewritten version for
      Princess Diana''s funeral in 1997.  We need to consider both.

      2. **Scared to Be Lonely** by Martin Garrix was released in 2017.

      3. The 1973 version of Candle in the Wind is older than Scared to Be Lonely.

      4. The 1997 version of Candle in the Wind is older than Scared to Be Lonely.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.

      has two prominent releases: the original 1973 version about Marilyn Monroe and
      the 1997 rewrite "Candle in the Wind 1997" (also known as "Goodbye England''s
      Rose") about Princess Diana.  The later version is generally what people refer
      to when discussing the song.


      2. **Scared to Be Lonely** by Martin Garrix was released in 2017.


      3. 1997 is earlier than 2017.


      Therefore, the answer is **NO**.

    f992b96c-3e27-4f14-9308-e33e987efcec: '1. **Candle in the Wind
      (1973) originally; Candle in the Wind 1997 (re-written version)** -  There are
      two versions of Elton John''s "Candle in the Wind". The original was released
      in 1973.  A rewritten version, "Candle in the Wind 1997" (also known as "Goodbye
      England''s Rose"), was released in 1997.  This is the more commonly known version
      nowadays.


      2. **Scared to Be Lonely (2017)** - Martin Garrix''s "Scared to Be Lonely" was
      released in 2017.


      3. **Comparison:** 1973 is earlier than 2017, and 1997 is earlier than 2017.


      Therefore, both versions of "Candle in the Wind" predate "Scared to Be Lonely."
