      by Elton John:

      - This song was released in 1976 as part of his album "Blue Moves"


      2. Next, I''ll find the release date of "Ride" by Twenty One Pilots:

      - This song was released in 2015 as part of their album "Blurryface"


      3. Compare the two dates:

      - 1976 is much earlier than 2015


      4. Therefore, Elton John''s song was released BEFORE Twenty One Pilots''s song.
