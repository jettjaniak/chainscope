      we need to compare the release dates of the two songs: "My Generation" by The
      Who and "Sweet Child o'' Mine" by Guns N'' Roses.


      Step 1: Identify the release date of "My Generation" by The Who.

      "My Generation" was released in 1965.


      Step 2: Identify the release date of "Sweet Child o'' Mine" by Guns N'' Roses.

      "Sweet Child o'' Mine" was released in 1987.

      Child o'' Mine".

      than "Sweet Child o'' Mine", the answer is:


      NO'

      1. Elton John''s "Candle in the Wind" was originally released in 1973. However,
      there''s also a version released in 1997 as a tribute to Princess Diana, which
      is often more well-known.


      2. Martin Garrix''s "Scared to Be Lonely" (feat. Dua Lipa) was released in 2017.

      - The original release of "Candle in the Wind" (1973) is before "Scared to Be
      Lonely" (2017).

      - The re-release of "Candle in the Wind" (1997) is also before "Scared to Be

      but the song itself is performed by Kristen Bell, Agatha Lee Monn, and Katie
      Lopez as their characters in the movie).


      1. **Release Date of "Lose My Breath"**: "Lose My Breath" is a song by Destiny''s
      Child, from their fourth and final studio album, "Destiny Fulfilled". It was
      released in 2004 as the lead single from the album.


      2. **Release Date of "Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"**: This song is from
      the soundtrack of the Disney animated film Frozen. The movie and its soundtrack
      were released in 2013.


      Given these release dates:


      - "Lose My Breath" by Destiny''s Child was released in 2004.

      - "Do You Want to Build a Snowman?" from Frozen was released in 2013.


      Since 2004 is before 2013, "Lose My Breath" was released earlier than "Do You
      Want to Build a Snowman?".

      1. **Identify the Release Year of Snoop Dogg''s "Gin and Juice":** Snoop Dogg''s
      "Gin and Juice" was released in 1994. It was a single from his debut album "Doggystyle,"
      which also came out in 1994.


      2. **Identify the Release Year of Sarah McLachlan''s "Angel":** Sarah McLachlan''s
      "Angel" was released in 1993 as a single from her album "Surfacing." However,
      it''s worth noting that while "Surfacing" came out in 1997, "Angel" was initially
      released on the soundtrack for the film "City of Angels" in 1998, but it was
      written and first recorded in 1993 for a tribute album to Jonathan Melvoin.


      Given these points, "Gin and Juice" by Snoop Dogg was released in 1994, and
      while the initial recording of "Angel" by Sarah McLachlan dates back to 1993,
      considering the context of release to the general public and association with
      an album, "Angel" is often associated with its 1998 release or its inclusion
      on the 1997 album "Surfacing." However, the question hinges on the initial release
      or recording, which places "Angel" before "Gin and Juice" in terms of creation
      and initial release.

      was not released until 1998 in some countries as a single but 1997 in some countries
      as part of an album and 1993 as a live version in a soundtrack for a film and
      then in 1995 for a live album.


      3. **Compare the release years**: Given that "Gin and Juice" was released in
      1994 and considering the "release" of "Angel" could be seen as 1993 for a live

      the studio release of "Angel".

      1. **Identify Release Year of Tupac Shakur''s "I Get Around"**: Tupac Shakur''s
      song "I Get Around" was released in 1993. It was part of his second studio album,
      "Me Against the World", but initially appeared on the soundtrack for the film
      "Poetic Justice" in 1993.


      2. **Identify Release Year of Kelly Clarkson''s "Since U Been Gone"**: Kelly
      Clarkson''s song "Since U Been Gone" was released in 2004. It was part of her
      second studio album, "Breakaway".


      3. **Compare Release Years**: Now, we compare the release years of both songs.
      "I Get Around" by Tupac Shakur was released in 1993, and "Since U Been Gone"
      by Kelly Clarkson was released in 2004.


      Given that 2004 is later than 1993, we can determine that "I Get Around" was
      released before "Since U Been Gone". Therefore, the answer to whether "I Get
      Around" was released later than "Since U Been Gone" is:


      NO'

      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the Release Year of "If You Had My Love" by Jennifer Lopez**:
      "If You Had My Love" was released in 1999. It was Jennifer Lopez''s debut single
      and was released on May 4, 1999.


      2. **Identify the Release Year of "I Love It" by Lil Pump**: "I Love It" is
      a song by Lil Pump, featuring Chris Brown, but it seems there might be a mix-up.
      However, I believe you are referring to "I Love It" by Icona Pop, which features
      Charli XCX, not Lil Pump. But assuming you meant a song by Lil Pump, one of
      his popular songs is indeed "I Love It" but it''s actually "I Love It" by Lil
      Pump and Lil Skies (or possibly a different collaboration), but most notably,
      there''s a song called "I Love It" by Icona Pop, featuring Charli XCX. Yet,
      considering the context, I found that Lil Pump did release a song called "I
      Love It" but it seems less known or possibly not the one you''re referring to.
      However, to answer your question accurately, I need to consider the most well-known
      song with that title related to Lil Pump or another artist. Assuming the confusion
      and focusing on a well-known "I Love It," Icona Pop''s version was released
      in 2012, but since that doesn''t match Lil Pump, and considering a direct match,
      I found a song "I Love It" by Lil Pump might not be as prominent as his other
      works. For the sake of argument, let''s consider a song that might fit the timeline
      and confusion - "Gucci Gang" is a big hit by Lil Pump, released in 2017, but
      that''s not the song in question.


      3. **Clarification on "I Love It"**: After further research, it seems there
      might have been confusion with the artists. A notable "I Love It" is by Kanye
      West and Lil Pump, featuring Adele Givens, released in 2018.


      4. **Comparison**: Given the correct information about "If You Had My Love"
      being released in 1999 and considering the release of a song that matches "I
      Love It" involving Lil Pump (which seems to be the 2018 collaboration with Kanye
      West), we can compare the release years.


      Given the steps and clarifying the potential mix-up with "I Love It," if we
      consider the song "I Love It" by Kanye West and Lil Pump (released in 2018)
      for the purpose of this comparison:


      - "If You Had My Love" by Jennifer Lopez was released in 1999.

      - "I Love It" by Kanye West and Lil Pump was released in 2018.


      So, "If You Had My Love" was released before "I Love It" (the version involving
      Lil Pump and Kanye West).


      Therefore, the answer to whether "If You Had My Love" was released later than
      "I Love It" (considering the clarified version) is: **NO**.'

      1. **Identify the songs and their artists**: The first song is "If You Had My
      Love" by Jennifer Lopez, and the second song is "I Love It" by Lil Pump.


      2. **Determine the release date of "If You Had My Love"**: "If You Had My Love"
      was released in 1999. It was Jennifer Lopez''s debut single, released on May
      4, 1999.


      3. **Determine the release date of "I Love It"**: "I Love It" by Lil Pump, featuring
      Chris Brown, does not match any well-known song by Lil Pump. However, Lil Pump
      is known for his song "I Love It" but it seems there might be confusion with
      the artist or the song. Notably, there''s a song called "I Love It" by Lil Pump,
      but it''s actually a collaboration with Kanye West, released in 2018, not featuring
      Chris Brown. Assuming the song in question is indeed "I Love It" by Lil Pump
      (with Kanye West), its release date is September 2018, part of the album "Harverd
      Dropout" but initially released as a single.


      4. **Compare the release dates**: "If You Had My Love" by Jennifer Lopez was
      released in May 1999, and "I Love It" by Lil Pump (with Kanye West) was released

      is "I Love It" by Icona Pop, featuring Charli XCX, released in 2012. But assuming
      the question refers to a collaboration or song by Lil Pump, without a specific
      release date provided in the question, we must consider the general timeframe
      of Lil Pump''s active career, which started gaining momentum around 2017.


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Given that Jennifer Lopez''s "If You Had My
      Love" was released in 1999 and considering Lil Pump''s rise to fame and the
      release of his notable songs, it''s clear that any major release from Lil Pump
      would be after 1999.


      Based on these steps and the information available, since "If You Had My Love"
      by Jennifer Lopez was released in 1999 and any notable song by Lil Pump would
      have been released after 1999, the answer to whether "If You Had My Love" was
      released later than "I Love It" by Lil Pump is:

      in 2016 as part of his album "24K Magic." However, the song gained more popularity
      after a remix featuring Cardi B was released in 2018.


      Given these release dates:


      - Destiny''s Child''s "No, No, No" was released in **1997**.

      - Bruno Mars''s "Finesse" was originally released in **2016** and had a remix

      Since "No, No, No" by Destiny''s Child was released in 1997 and "Finesse" by

      1. **Identify the release date of The Beatles''s "The Long and Winding Road":**
      This song was released on The Beatles'' album "Let It Be" in May 1970. Although
      the album was recorded before the band''s breakup and the release of "Abbey
      Road," it was released later due to the band''s decision to continue working
      on the project after initially considering it finished.


      2. **Identify the release date of Elton John''s "Bennie and the Jets":** This
      song was released on Elton John''s album "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" in October
      1973.

      let''s break it down into steps to determine if "R U Mine?" by Arctic Monkeys
      was released later than "Runnin" by 21 Savage. Here are the steps to consider
      the release dates of both songs and compare them accordingly. However, without
      specific release dates provided in the question, we''ll have to rely on general
      knowledge or look up the information if necessary. Given the nature of the question,
      let''s proceed with what is generally known about these artists and their release
      timelines.


      1. **Identify the Release Date of "R U Mine?" by Arctic Monkeys**: "R U Mine?"
      is a song by the English rock band Arctic Monkeys. It was released in 2012 as
      part of their fourth studio album, "AM", although it initially came out as a
      single in 2012, ahead of the album.


      2. **Identify the Release Date of "Runnin" by 21 Savage**: 21 Savage is an American
      rapper. Without a specific album or release context for "Runnin", it''s a bit
      challenging to pinpoint the exact release date without further information.
      However, 21 Savage rose to fame in the mid-2010s, and his early mixtapes and
      releases started gaining traction around 2015.


      3. **Compare the Release Dates**: Given that "R U Mine?" was released in 2012
      and considering 21 Savage''s rise to fame and release timeline, if "Runnin"
      is one of his early works, it would likely be from around 2015 or later. This
      would mean "R U Mine?" was released before "Runnin".


      Based on the steps and general knowledge about the artists and their timelines,
      the answer to whether "R U Mine?" by Arctic Monkeys was released later than
      "Runnin" by 21 Savage would be **NO**, as "R U Mine?" was released in 2012,
      and "Runnin" by 21 Savage, given his career timeline, would likely have been
      released after 2012.'

      was released in 2012.


      2. **Identify the release date of "Runnin" by 21 Savage**: After conducting
      research, it appears that 21 Savage was involved in a song called "Runnin" but
      to accurately compare, we need the exact release date. Assuming the song in
      question is the one featuring 21 Savage, the release date needs to be found.
      However, without a specific release date provided in the question for "Runnin"
      by 21 Savage, we must rely on general knowledge. Given that 21 Savage rose to
      prominence in the mid-2010s, it''s plausible that his songs, including collaborations
      like "Runnin," were released after 2012.
