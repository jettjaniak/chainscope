      Saint Patrick was a Christian missionary and bishop in Ireland during the 5th

      have been born in the late 4th century, around 385-390 AD.


      Pierre Trudeau was a Canadian politician who served as the 15th Prime Minister
      of Canada. He was born on October 18, 1919, and died on September 28, 2000.


      So comparing:

      - Saint Patrick: born around 385-390 AD

      - Pierre Trudeau: born in 1919 AD


      Since 1919 is over 1500 years later than 390 AD, Pierre Trudeau was born much
      later than Saint Patrick. So the answer to "Was Saint Patrick born later than
      Pierre Trudeau?" is NO - it''s the opposite. Saint Patrick was born first, and
      Pierre Trudeau was born later.</think>I need to determine which of these historical

      Saint Patrick was a Christian missionary in Ireland who lived during the 5th
      century. Historical records suggest he was born around 385-390 AD (though exact
      dates are uncertain).


      Step 2: Identify when Pierre Trudeau lived.

      Pierre Trudeau was a Canadian politician who served as Prime Minister of Canada.
      He was born on October 18, 1919, and died in 2000.


      Step 3: Compare the two birth dates.

      Saint Patrick was born in the late 4th century (around 385-390 AD).

      Pierre Trudeau was born in the 20th century (1919 AD).


      Step 4: Determine which came later.

      Pierre Trudeau was born approximately 1,530 years after Saint Patrick.


      NO, Saint Patrick was not born later than Pierre Trudeau. Saint Patrick was
      born much earlier.'

      **Saint Patrick:**

      Saint Patrick was a Christian missionary in Ireland during the 5th century.

      Saint Patrick (born circa 385-390 AD) lived approximately 1,530 years before
      Pierre Trudeau (born 1919).


      Step 4: Determine if Saint Patrick was born later than Pierre Trudeau.

      - Pierre Trudeau: born in 1919 CE


      Since 1919 is much later than 385-405, Pierre Trudeau was born later than Saint

      - Pierre Trudeau: born in 1919 CE (20th century)


      Since 1919 CE is approximately 1500 years after Saint Patrick was born, Pierre

      Lewis Carroll was born later than Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I need to determine when
      each of them was born.


      Lewis Carroll was the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, who was an English
      author known for "Alice''s Adventures in Wonderland." He was born in the 19th
      century, specifically on January 27, 1832. He died on January 14, 1898.


      Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
      She was born much later, on March 15, 1933. She died on September 18, 2020.


      Comparing these birth dates:

      - Lewis Carroll: January 27, 1832

      - Ruth Bader Ginsburg: March 15, 1933


      Since 1832 is earlier than 1933, Lewis Carroll was born earlier than Ruth Bader
      Ginsburg, not later.</think>To determine if Lewis Carroll was born later than
      Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I need to find and compare their birth years.


      Step 1: Identify when Lewis Carroll was born.

      Lewis Carroll (whose real name was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) was born on January
      27, 1832. He was the author of "Alice''s Adventures in Wonderland" and lived
      during the Victorian era.


      Step 2: Identify when Ruth Bader Ginsburg was born.

      Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court Justice, was born on March 15, 1933.


      Step 3: Compare the two birth years.

      1832 (Carroll) vs. 1933 (Ginsburg)


      Step 4: Determine which date came later.

      1933 is later than 1832 by about 101 years.


      Therefore, Lewis Carroll was NOT born later than Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He was
      born approximately a century before her.

      Lewis Carroll (whose real name was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) was the author

      Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a U.S. Supreme Court Justice who was born on March 15,
      1933.


      Comparing these dates:

      - Carroll: born in 1832

      - Ginsburg: born in 1933


      Since 1832 is earlier than 1933, Lewis Carroll was born before Ruth Bader Ginsburg,

      Johann Sebastian Bach was a famous German composer of the Baroque period. He
      was born on March 31, 1685.


      Now for Alighiero di Bellincione. This name sounds Italian and somewhat old.
      Let me think about who this might be... Alighiero di Bellincione was actually
      the father of Dante Alighieri, the famous Italian poet who wrote "The Divine
      Comedy." Since Dante lived in the late 13th and early 14th centuries (Dante
      lived from approximately 1265 to 1321), his father Alighiero di Bellincione
      would have been born sometime in the 13th century, likely several decades before
      Dante was born, so possibly around 1230-1250.


      So we have:

      - Alighiero di Bellincione: born approximately in the mid-13th century (around
      1230-1250)

      - Johann Sebastian Bach: born in 1685


      Comparing these dates, Alighiero di Bellincione was born much earlier than Johann
      Sebastian Bach - about 400-450 years earlier. So the answer is NO, Alighiero
      di Bellincione was NOT born later than Johann Sebastian Bach.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to determine when each person was born and compare their

      Step 1: Identify who Johann Sebastian Bach was and when he was born.

      Johann Sebastian Bach was a famous German Baroque composer who was born on March
      31, 1685.


      Step 2: Identify who Alighiero di Bellincione was and when he was born.

      Alighiero di Bellincione was the father of Dante Alighieri (the famous Italian
      poet who wrote "The Divine Comedy"). He lived in the 13th century, being born
      approximately between 1210-1250.

      First, let me recall when Johann Sebastian Bach was born. Bach was a famous
      German composer of the Baroque period. He was born on March 31, 1685.


      Now, who is Alighiero di Bellincione? This name seems to be referring to Dante
      Alighieri''s father. Dante Alighieri was the famous Italian poet who wrote "The

      and his father Alighiero di Bellincione would have been born before him, likely
      in the mid-13th century.


      So, Alighiero di Bellincione (Dante''s father) was born around the mid-13th
      century, while Johann Sebastian Bach was born in 1685, which is in the late

      1321. Since Alighiero di Bellincione was Dante''s father, he must have been
      born before Dante, sometime in the 13th century.


      So, comparing the birth dates:

      - Alighiero di Bellincione: born sometime in the 13th century (1200s)

      - Johann Sebastian Bach: born in 1685 (17th century)


      Since the 13th century came before the 17th century, Alighiero di Bellincione
      was born earlier than Johann Sebastian Bach.</think>I need to determine when
      these two historical figures were born.


      Johann Sebastian Bach was a famous German composer of the Baroque period. He
      was born on March 31, 1685.


      Alighiero di Bellincione was the father of Dante Alighieri (the Italian poet
      who wrote "The Divine Comedy"). Dante was born around 1265, so his father Alighiero
      would have been born sometime in the mid-13th century, approximately in the
      1230s-1240s.


      Comparing these dates:

      - Alighiero di Bellincione: born around mid-13th century (1230s-1240s)

      - Johann Sebastian Bach: born in 1685 (17th century)


      Since Alighiero di Bellincione was born about 450 years before Bach, he was
      not born later than Bach.

      born sometime before that, likely in the early to mid-13th century.


      Since Alighiero di Bellincione was born in the 13th century (c. 1200s) and Johann

    aa928762-8923-462d-819d-a61c2347e404: '<think>Let me determine when Saint Valentine
      and Larry King were born.


      Saint Valentine:

      Saint Valentine (or Valentinus) was a Christian martyr. There are actually multiple
      saints called Valentine, but the most well-known Saint Valentine of Rome was
      believed to have lived in the 3rd century CE. The exact birth date is not known,
      but he is believed to have died around 269-270 CE. So he was born sometime in
      the 3rd century CE or earlier.


      Larry King:

      Larry King was a modern American television and radio host. He was born on November
      19, 1933, and died on January 23, 2021.


      Comparing:

      Saint Valentine was born in the 3rd century CE (around 200-269 CE).

      Larry King was born in 1933 CE.


      Since 3rd century CE (200-299) is much earlier than 1933 CE, Saint Valentine
      was born earlier than Larry King, not later.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to determine when each person was born and compare the dates.


      Step 1: Identify when Saint Valentine lived.

      Saint Valentine was a Christian martyr who lived in the 3rd century CE. While
      his exact birth date is unknown, he is believed to have died around 269-270
      CE, making his birth likely in the early 3rd century or late 2nd century CE.


      Step 2: Identify when Larry King lived.

      Larry King was a modern American television and radio host who was born on November
      19, 1933, and died in 2021.


      Step 3: Compare the two time periods.

      Saint Valentine lived approximately 1,700 years before Larry King. The 3rd century
      CE (around 200-300 CE) is much earlier than 1933 CE.

      when two people were born:

      1. Saint Valentine

      2. Larry King


      I need to determine the birth dates (or approximate time periods) for each person
      to determine who was born earlier.


      Saint Valentine was a Christian martyr who lived in the Roman Empire. While
      the exact details of his life are not certain, the common understanding is that
      he lived in the 3rd century AD. He is associated with the Valentine''s Day celebration
      on February 14. He was likely born around the early 3rd century, so approximately
      200-225 AD.


      Larry King was a modern American television and radio host who lived from 1933
      to 2021. He was born on November 19, 1933.


      Comparing these dates:

      - Saint Valentine: born around early 3rd century (approximately 200-225 AD)

      - Larry King: born in 1933 AD


      Since 200-225 AD came before 1933 AD, Saint Valentine was born earlier than
      Larry King.


      So the answer to "Was Saint Valentine born later than Larry King?" is NO.</think>I
      need to determine when each person was born to compare their timelines.


      Saint Valentine:

      - Saint Valentine was a Christian martyr who lived during the Roman Empire

      - Historical records place him in the 3rd century AD (around 200-270 AD)

      - He died around 270 AD

      - While exact birth dates aren''t known, he clearly lived in ancient Rome


      Larry King:

      - Larry King was a modern American broadcaster and television host

      - He was born on November 19, 1933

      - He died in 2021


      Comparing these timelines:

      Saint Valentine lived approximately 1,700 years before Larry King was born.
      Saint Valentine existed in the 3rd century, while Larry King was born in the
      20th century.

      Saint Valentine:

      Saint Valentine (or Valentinus) was a Christian martyr who lived in the Roman
      Empire, likely in the 3rd century CE. The most common account places him in
      the time of Emperor Claudius II, who ruled from 268 to 270 CE. Saint Valentine
      is believed to have died around 270 CE. So he was likely born in the early or
      mid-3rd century CE, perhaps around 200-230 CE.


      Larry King:

      Larry King was a modern American television and radio host. He was born on November
      19, 1933, and died on January 23, 2021.


      Comparing:

      Saint Valentine was born around the 3rd century CE (approximately 1,700-1,800
      years ago).

      Larry King was born in 1933 CE, which is only about 90 years ago.


      Therefore, Larry King was born much later than Saint Valentine. The answer is
      NO - Saint Valentine was NOT born later than Larry King.</think>I need to determine
      the birth dates of both Saint Valentine and Larry King to compare them.


      Saint Valentine was a Christian martyr who lived during the Roman Empire, specifically
      in the 3rd century CE. While his exact birth date is unknown, historical accounts
      place him living during the reign of Emperor Claudius II (around 268-270 CE)
      when he was martyred. So he was born approximately 1,800 years ago.


      Larry King was a well-known American television and radio host who was born
      on November 19, 1933, and died in 2021.


      Comparing these dates:

      - Larry King: born in 1933 CE


      Since Saint Valentine was born in the 3rd century and Larry King was born in

      to compare the birth years of Leonardo da Vinci and Freddie Mercury.


      Leonardo da Vinci was an Italian Renaissance polymath who lived during the 15th-16th
      centuries. He was born on April 15, 1452, in Vinci, Italy, and died on May 2,
      1519.


      Freddie Mercury was a British singer and songwriter who was the lead vocalist
      of the rock band Queen. He was born on September 5, 1946, in Zanzibar (now part
      of Tanzania), and died on November 24, 1991.


      So:

      - Leonardo da Vinci: born in 1452

      - Freddie Mercury: born in 1946


      To determine who was born later, I need to compare these years. 1946 is nearly
      500 years after 1452, so Freddie Mercury was born later than Leonardo da Vinci.


      But the question asks if Leonardo da Vinci was born later than Freddie Mercury,
      which is the opposite. So the answer is NO.</think>I need to determine when
      each person was born to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify Leonardo da Vinci''s birth year.

      Leonardo da Vinci was born on April 15, 1452, during the Renaissance period
      in Italy.


      Step 2: Identify Freddie Mercury''s birth year.

      Freddie Mercury (lead vocalist of the band Queen) was born on September 5, 1946,
      in the 20th century.


      Step 3: Compare the two birth years.

      1452 (da Vinci) vs. 1946 (Mercury)

      Since 1452 came before 1946, Leonardo da Vinci was born almost 500 years earlier
      than Freddie Mercury.

      Step 2: Identify Isaac Asimov''s birth date.

      Isaac Asimov was born on January 2, 1920 (though there is some uncertainty about
      the exact date due to calendar differences, it was around 1919-1920).

      The question asks whether Nicolaus Copernicus was born later than Max Wilhelm

      Nicolaus Copernicus was a Renaissance-era mathematician and astronomer who formulated
      the model of the universe that placed the Sun rather than Earth at the center

      Nicolaus Copernicus was a Renaissance astronomer and mathematician who developed
      the heliocentric model of the solar system. He was born on February 19, 1473.


      Step 2: Identify when Max Weber was born.

      Max Weber (Max Wilhelm Carl Weber) was a German sociologist, economist, and
      political economist who is considered one of the founders of modern sociology.
      He was born on April 21, 1864.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      1473 (Copernicus) comes before 1864 (Weber)


      Step 4: Draw conclusion based on the comparison.

      Since Copernicus was born in 1473 and Weber was born in 1864, Copernicus was
      born approximately 391 years EARLIER than Weber, not later.

      To compare these dates, I need to place them on the same timeline. Since 356
      BCE occurred before the year 0, and 1913 CE occurred after the year 0, Richard
      Nixon was born later than Alexander the Great.


      So the answer is NO, Alexander the Great was NOT born later than Richard Nixon.
      Alexander was born earlier.


      Actually wait - I think I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again:
      "Was Alexander the Great born later than Richard Nixon?"


      If Alexander was born in 356 BCE and Nixon was born in 1913 CE, then Alexander
      was born about 2269 years before Nixon. So Alexander was born earlier, not later,

      356 BCE is over 2,000 years before 1913 CE.

      So Alexander the Great was born much earlier than Richard Nixon.


      4) To answer the specific question "Was Alexander the Great born later than

      Alexander the Great lived from 356 BCE to 323 BCE (BCE means Before Common Era,
      which is equivalent to BC - Before Christ).


      Step 2: Let me identify when Richard Nixon lived.

      Richard Nixon lived from 1913 CE to 1994 CE (CE means Common Era, which is equivalent

      20th century.

      Richard Nixon was born in 1913 CE, which is in the 20th century.


      Step 4: Determine which person was born later.

      Since BCE years count backward (the smaller the number, the more recent), and
      Alexander was born in 356 BCE, he was born over 2,000 years before Nixon (born
      in 1913 CE).

      Step 3: To compare these dates, I need to recognize that BCE dates are earlier
      than CE dates. Additionally, a larger number in BCE represents an earlier time
      (356 BCE is earlier than 100 BCE, for example).


      Step 4: Since 356 BCE (Alexander''s birth) occurred more than 2,000 years before
      1913 CE (Nixon''s birth), Richard Nixon was born much later than Alexander the
      Great.

      The question asks if Nelson Mandela was born later than Kurt Cobain, which is
      the opposite of what I found.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine

      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      1918 comes before 1967 chronologically. This means Nelson Mandela was born approximately
      49 years before Kurt Cobain.


      NO, Nelson Mandela was not born later than Kurt Cobain. Nelson Mandela was born

      - Johannes Gutenberg: c. 1400

      - Florence Nightingale: 1820


      Since 1400 is earlier than 1820, Gutenberg was born earlier than Nightingale,

      But the question asks about "Friedrich Nitzsch" not "Friedrich Nietzsche" -
      I should be careful about assuming they''re the same person. However, "Nitzsch"

      Actually, I should double-check if the question was about Friedrich Nietzsche
      or someone actually named Friedrich Nitzsch. The spelling is different.


      Upon reflection, I believe the question is referring to Friedrich Nietzsche
      (the famous philosopher) but with a slightly misspelled last name. I''m not
      aware of a significant historical figure named Friedrich Nitzsch.


      So comparing their birth years:

      - Friedrich Nietzsche: 1844

      - Joseph Stalin: 1878


      Stalin was born later than Nietzsche, not the other way around.</think>I need
      to determine when each historical figure was born to answer this question.


      Friedrich Nietzsche (assuming "Nitzsch" refers to the famous German philosopher)
      was born on October 15, 1844.


      Joseph Stalin was born on December 18, 1878.


      Comparing these dates:

      - Nietzsche: 1844

      - Stalin: 1878


      Since 1878 comes after 1844, Stalin was born 34 years later than Nietzsche.


      The question asks if Friedrich Nitzsch was born later than Stalin, which is
      the opposite of what the facts show.

      1) First, I need to determine when Friedrich Nietzsche was born. Friedrich Nietzsche

      born on December 18, 1878.


      3) Now I can compare these dates. December 18, 1878 is later than October 15,

      Wait, I need to be careful here. The question asks about "Friedrich Nitzsch"
      not "Friedrich Nietzsche" - the spelling is different. Let me check if there
      was a historical figure named Friedrich Nitzsch.


      I don''t have specific information about a historical figure named precisely
      "Friedrich Nitzsch." It''s possible this is a misspelling of Friedrich Nietzsche,
      or it could be referring to a different historical figure I''m not familiar
      with.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the birth dates of
      both Friedrich Nitzsch and Joseph Stalin, then compare them.


      First, Joseph Stalin''s birth date: Stalin was born on December 18, 1878.


      For Friedrich Nitzsch, there appears to be some confusion. If this refers to
      Friedrich Nietzsche, the famous philosopher, he was born on October 15, 1844.
      If it refers to a different historical figure named Friedrich Nitzsch, I would
      need to identify that specific person.


      Assuming the question refers to Friedrich Nietzsche (with the typical spelling),
      then:

      - Nietzsche: Born 1844

      - Stalin: Born 1878


      Since 1878 is later than 1844, Stalin was born after Nietzsche, not the other
      way around.

      - James Cook: born in 1728

      - J.P. Morgan: born in 1837


      Since 1837 is later than 1728, J.P. Morgan was born later than James Cook, not
      the other way around.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine when

      James Cook was a British explorer and navigator who was born on October 27,
      1728.


      Step 2: Identify J.P. Morgan''s birth year.

      J.P. Morgan (John Pierpont Morgan) was an American banker and financier who
      was born on April 17, 1837.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      1728 (Cook) comes before 1837 (Morgan)

      Therefore, J.P. Morgan was born later than James Cook, not Cook later than Morgan.

      Isaac Newton was born on December 25, 1642 (or January 4, 1643, depending on
      the calendar used) in England. He was a physicist, mathematician, and astronomer
      who lived in the 17th and early 18th centuries.


      Andy Warhol was born on August 6, 1928 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was a

      Step 2: Establish when Andy Warhol was born.

      Andy Warhol was born on August 6, 1928.


      Step 3: Compare the two birth dates.

      1642/1643 comes before 1928 chronologically. This means Isaac Newton was born
      almost 300 years before Andy Warhol.


      NO, Isaac Newton was not born later than Andy Warhol. In fact, it''s the opposite
      - Isaac Newton was born significantly earlier than Andy Warhol.'

      Louis XIV of France, also known as the "Sun King," reigned France for a long

      Rajiv Gandhi was a Prime Minister of India in the 20th century. He was born

      1638 came before 1944, so Louis XIV was born earlier than Rajiv Gandhi, not

      Step 2: Rajiv Gandhi was born on August 20, 1944. He was an Indian politician
      who served as Prime Minister of India in the 1980s.


      Step 3: Comparing the birth years: 1638 vs. 1944.


      Step 4: Since 1638 is earlier than 1944, Louis XIV was born approximately 306
      years before Rajiv Gandhi.


      NO, Louis XIV of France was not born later than Rajiv Gandhi.'

      Eisenhower, not the other way around.</think># Was Dwight D. Eisenhower born
      later than Ingrid Bergman?


      Let me work through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to determine when each person was born.


      2) Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th U.S. President, was born on October 14, 1890.


      3) Ingrid Bergman, the famous Swedish actress known for films like "Casablanca,"
      was born on August 29, 1915.


      4) Comparing these dates: 1890 vs. 1915.


      5) Since 1890 comes before 1915, Eisenhower was born earlier than Bergman, not
      later.

      to determine when Dwight D. Eisenhower and Ingrid Bergman were born, and then
      compare those dates.


      Dwight D. Eisenhower was the 34th President of the United States. He was born
      on October 14, 1890 in Denison, Texas.


      Ingrid Bergman was a Swedish actress who starred in many famous films including
      Casablanca. She was born on August 29, 1915 in Stockholm, Sweden.


      Now I can compare these dates:

      - Eisenhower: October 14, 1890

      - Bergman: August 29, 1915


      Since 1915 is later than 1890, Ingrid Bergman was born after Eisenhower. The
      question asks if Eisenhower was born later than Bergman, which would be the
      opposite.</think>I''ll reason through this step-by-step:


      Step 1: I need to identify when each person was born.

      - Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th U.S. President, was born on October 14, 1890.

      - Ingrid Bergman, the famous Swedish actress, was born on August 29, 1915.


      Step 2: Compare these dates to determine who was born later.

      - 1915 comes after 1890 chronologically.

      - This means Ingrid Bergman was born approximately 25 years after Eisenhower.


      Step 3: Answer the specific question - was Eisenhower born later than Bergman?

      - No, Eisenhower was born first (1890), while Bergman was born later (1915).

      Step 3: Compare the two birth dates.

      1859 (Doyle) comes before 1928 (Guevara), meaning Doyle was born earlier and
      Guevara was born later.


      NO. Arthur Conan Doyle was not born later than Che Guevara. In fact, it''s the
      opposite - Doyle was born about 69 years before Guevara.'

      Doyle and Che Guevara were born.


      Arthur Conan Doyle was the author who created Sherlock Holmes. He was born in

      Che Guevara was a Marxist revolutionary who was prominent in the Cuban Revolution.
      He was born in the 20th century, specifically in 1928.


      So to determine who was born later:

      - Arthur Conan Doyle: born in 1859

      - Che Guevara: born in 1928


      Since 1928 is later than 1859, Che Guevara was born later than Arthur Conan
      Doyle, not the other way around.</think>To answer this question, I need to identify
      when each person was born and compare the dates.


      Step 1: Determine when Arthur Conan Doyle was born.

      Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, was born on May 22, 1859.


      Step 2: Determine when Che Guevara was born.

      Che Guevara, the Marxist revolutionary, was born on June 14, 1928.


      Step 3: Compare the two birth dates.

      1859 (Doyle) comes before 1928 (Guevara).

      Therefore, Che Guevara was born later than Arthur Conan Doyle, not the other
      way around.

      Che Guevara, the Marxist revolutionary, was born on June 14, 1928 in Rosario,
      Argentina.


      Comparing these dates:

      - Doyle: 1859

      - Guevara: 1928


      Since 1859 comes before 1928, Arthur Conan Doyle was born 69 years earlier than

      Che Guevara was a Marxist revolutionary who played a major role in the Cuban
      Revolution. He was born on June 14, 1928 in Rosario, Argentina.


      Now, to answer the question "Was Arthur Conan Doyle born later than Che Guevara?",
      I need to compare these two dates:

      - Arthur Conan Doyle: born in 1859

      - Che Guevara: born in 1928


      1859 comes before 1928, so Arthur Conan Doyle was born earlier than Che Guevara,

      Joan of Arc was a medieval French heroine who lived in the 15th century. She
      was born around 1412 and died in 1431 (she was burned at the stake when she
      was 19 years old).


      Mother Teresa was a Catholic nun and missionary who lived in the 20th century.
      She was born in 1910 and died in 1997.


      To determine if Joan of Arc was born later than Mother Teresa, I need to compare
      their birth years:

      - Joan of Arc: born around 1412

      - Mother Teresa: born in 1910


      1412 is earlier than 1910. Therefore, Joan of Arc was NOT born later than Mother
      Teresa; she was born approximately 500 years before Mother Teresa.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine when each historical figure was born
      and compare the dates.


      Step 1: Identify when Joan of Arc was born.

      Joan of Arc was born around 1412 in medieval France.


      Step 2: Identify when Mother Teresa was born.

      Mother Teresa was born in 1910 in what is now North Macedonia.


      Step 3: Compare the two birth years.

      1412 (Joan of Arc) comes before 1910 (Mother Teresa) on the timeline.


      Step 4: Determine if Joan of Arc was born later than Mother Teresa.

      Since 1412 is earlier than 1910, Joan of Arc was born approximately 500 years
      BEFORE Mother Teresa, not later.

      1. I need to determine when Joan of Arc and Mother Teresa were born.


      2. Joan of Arc was a medieval French military leader who was born around 1412
      and died in 1431. She lived during the Hundred Years'' War.


      3. Mother Teresa was a Catholic nun and missionary who was born on August 26,
      1910, and died on September 5, 1997. She worked in India and founded the Missionaries

      (born 1412) vs. Mother Teresa (born 1910).


      5. 1910 is later than 1412 by almost 500 years.

      around.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine when each historical

      Step 1: Identify when Joan of Arc was born.

      Joan of Arc was born around 1412 in medieval France.


      Step 2: Identify when Mother Teresa was born.

      Mother Teresa was born on August 26, 1910 in what is now North Macedonia.


      Step 3: Compare the two birth dates.

      1412 (Joan of Arc) vs. 1910 (Mother Teresa)

      Mother Teresa was born approximately 498 years after Joan of Arc.


      Step 4: Determine who was born later.

      Since 1910 comes after 1412 chronologically, Mother Teresa was born later than
      Joan of Arc.


      The question asks if Joan of Arc was born later than Mother Teresa, which is
      the opposite of what I found.

      Joan of Arc was a French heroine who lived during the Hundred Years'' War. She

      Comparing:

      - Joan of Arc: born around 1412

      - Mother Teresa: born in 1910


      1910 is later than 1412, which means that Mother Teresa was born later than
