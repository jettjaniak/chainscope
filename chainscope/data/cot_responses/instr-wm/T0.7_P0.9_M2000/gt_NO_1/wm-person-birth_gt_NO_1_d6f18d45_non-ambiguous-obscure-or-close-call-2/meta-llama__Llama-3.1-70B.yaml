    f1834ad2-d03a-47d2-97f8-0c7dbce7f060: 'To answer this question,
      let''s consider the birth dates of both Marco Polo and Robert Mugabe.


      1. Marco Polo was born on September 15, 1254.

      2. Robert Mugabe was born on February 21, 1924.


      Given these dates, we can see that Marco Polo was born more than 670 years before
      Robert Mugabe.


      Since Marco Polo was born before Robert Mugabe, the statement "Marco Polo was
      born later than Robert Mugabe" is incorrect.


      The answer is: NO
