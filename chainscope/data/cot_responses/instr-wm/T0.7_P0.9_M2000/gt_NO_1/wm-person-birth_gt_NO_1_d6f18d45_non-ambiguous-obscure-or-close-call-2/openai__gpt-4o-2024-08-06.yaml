    f324e2cc-6279-41d5-aa9c-afbf84589227: 'To determine whether Sun Tzu was born later
      than Jim Morrison, let''s break down the information:


      1. Sun Tzu is traditionally believed to have been born around 544 BC. He was
      an ancient Chinese general, military strategist, and philosopher.


      2. Jim Morrison was born on December 8, 1943. He was an American singer, songwriter,
      and poet, best known as the lead vocalist of The Doors.


      Now, comparing the two birth years:


      - Sun Tzu''s estimated birth year: 544 BC

      - Jim Morrison''s birth year: 1943 AD


      Since 544 BC is earlier than 1943 AD, Sun Tzu was born much earlier than Jim
      Morrison.
