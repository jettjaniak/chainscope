      1. Ferdinand Magellan''s birth date:

      - Ferdinand Magellan was born in 1480 in Portugal

      - He lived during the Age of Exploration in the late 15th/early 16th century


      2. Grace Kelly''s birth date:

      - Grace Kelly was born in 1929 in Philadelphia, USA

      - She was a famous actress in the mid-20th century who later became Princess
