      1. **Find the birth date of Kim Jong-il**: Kim Jong-il, the former leader of
      North Korea, was born on February 16, 1941 (or 1942, according to some sources,
      but the commonly accepted date is 1941).


      2. **Find the birth date of Whitney Houston**: Whitney Houston, the American

      3. **Compare the birth dates**: To determine if Kim Jong-il was born later than
      Whitney Houston, we compare their birth dates. Kim Jong-il was born in 1941,
      and Whitney Houston was born in 1963.


      Given that 1941 is before 1963, we can conclude that Kim Jong-il was born before
      Whitney Houston.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Was Kim Jong-il born later than Whitney
      Houston?" is: **NO**.'

      2. Alexander Graham Bell was born on March 3, 1847.


      Now, comparing the birth years:


      - Benjamin Franklin was born in 1706.

      - Alexander Graham Bell was born in 1847.


      Since 1706 is earlier than 1847, Benjamin Franklin was born before Alexander
      Graham Bell.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Benjamin Franklin was born later than Alexander
      Graham Bell is: NO.'
