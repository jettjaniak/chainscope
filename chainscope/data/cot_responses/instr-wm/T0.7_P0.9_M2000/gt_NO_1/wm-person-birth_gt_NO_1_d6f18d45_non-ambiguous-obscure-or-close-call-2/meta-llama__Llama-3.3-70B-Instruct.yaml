      than Luciano Pavarotti, let''s establish their birth years.


      1. **Genghis Khan''s Birth Year**: The exact birth year of Genghis Khan is not
      known with certainty, but it is traditionally believed to be around 1162 AD.


      2. **Luciano Pavarotti''s Birth Year**: Luciano Pavarotti was born on October
      12, 1935.


      Given these dates:


      - Genghis Khan was born approximately in 1162 AD.

      - Luciano Pavarotti was born in 1935 AD.


      Since 1162 AD is significantly earlier than 1935 AD, it is clear that Genghis
      Khan was born long before Luciano Pavarotti.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Genghis Khan was born later than Luciano Pavarotti

      2. Luciano Pavarotti, the Italian opera singer, was born on October 12, 1935.


      Comparing the two birth dates:

      - Genghis Khan was born around 1162 AD.

      - Luciano Pavarotti was born in 1935 AD.


      Given that 1162 AD is significantly earlier than 1935 AD, we can conclude that

      3. **Compare the birth dates**: To determine if Kim Jong-il was born later than
      Whitney Houston, we compare their birth dates. Kim Jong-il was born in 1941,
      and Whitney Houston was born in 1963.


      Given that 1941 is before 1963, we can conclude that Kim Jong-il was born before
      Whitney Houston.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Was Kim Jong-il born later than Whitney
      Houston?" is: **NO**.'
    e92bf38d-051c-4cc5-b193-d7248d813eb6: 'To answer this question, let''s first find
      out the birth dates of Kim Jong-il and Whitney Houston.


      1. Kim Jong-il was born on February 16, 1941 (or 1942, as the exact date is
      disputed, but for the purpose of comparison, we''ll use 1941).

      2. Whitney Houston was born on August 9, 1963.


      Comparing the two birth dates, Kim Jong-il was born in 1941 and Whitney Houston
      in 1963. Since 1941 is before 1963, Kim Jong-il was born earlier than Whitney
      Houston.


      So, considering the question "Was Kim Jong-il born later than Whitney Houston?",
      the answer would be based on whether his birth date is after hers.


      The final answer is: NO'
