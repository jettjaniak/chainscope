      William Wallace: ~1270

      Peter the Great: 1672


      1672 is approximately 400 years after 1270.


      Therefore, Piotr I (Peter the Great) was born later than William Wallace.


      NO


      Wait, I made a mistake in my final answer. If the question asks "Was Piotr I
      born later than William Wallace?" and Piotr I was indeed born later (1672 vs.
      1270), then the answer should be:

      than William Wallace, I need to identify who these historical figures are and
      when they were born.


      Step 1: Identify the historical figures.

      - Piotr I likely refers to Peter I of Russia (Peter the Great), the Tsar of
      Russia.

      - William Wallace was a Scottish knight and military leader during the First
      War of Scottish Independence.


      Step 2: Determine their birth years.

      - Peter the Great was born on June 9, 1672.

      - William Wallace''s exact birth date is uncertain, but he is believed to have
      been born around 1270 (some sources suggest between 1270-1276).


      Step 3: Compare the birth years.

      - Peter the Great: 1672

      - William Wallace: circa 1270

      Wallace.

      Step 2: Determine when Robert Kennedy was born.

      Robert F. Kennedy (often called RFK) was an American politician who was born
      on November 20, 1925.


      Step 3: Compare the two birth dates.

      Leo Tolstoy: 1828

      Robert Kennedy: 1925


      Step 4: Determine who was born later.

      1925 is later than 1828, which means Robert Kennedy was born later than Leo
      Tolstoy, not the other way around.


      NO, Leo Tolstoy was not born later than Robert Kennedy.'

      J.R.R. Tolkien was born on January 3, 1892.


      Step 2: Identify Isaac Asimov''s birth year.

      Isaac Asimov was born on January 2, 1920 (though he sometimes used January 2,
      1920 as his official birth date due to uncertainty about his exact birth date
      in Russia).


      Step 3: Compare the two birth years.

      1892 (Tolkien) comes before 1920 (Asimov).


      Step 4: Determine who was born later.

      Since 1920 is later than 1892, Asimov was born later than Tolkien, not the other
      way around.


      NO - J.R.R. Tolkien was not born later than Isaac Asimov. Tolkien was born approximately
      28 years before Asimov.'

      astronomer who formulated the heliocentric model of the universe.


      Step 2: Identify when Max Wilhelm Carl Weber (Max Weber) was born.

      Max Weber was born on April 21, 1864. He was a German sociologist, economist,
      and political economist.


      Step 3: Compare the birth dates.

      Copernicus: 1473

      Weber: 1864


      Step 4: Determine which birth date came first.

      1473 is earlier than 1864, meaning Copernicus was born 391 years before Weber.


      Therefore, the answer to "Was Nicolaus Copernicus born later than Max Wilhelm
      Carl Weber?" is:


      NO'

      Step 1: Identify when Friedrich Nietzsche was born.

      Friedrich Nietzsche was born on October 15, 1844.


      Step 2: Identify when Joseph Stalin was born.

      Joseph Stalin was born on December 18, 1878.

      Step 2: Let me identify when Bruce Lee was born.

      Bruce Lee was born on November 27, 1940.


      Step 3: Compare the two birth dates.

      Johnny Cash (1932) was born before Bruce Lee (1940).


      Step 4: Determine who was born later.

      Since 1940 comes after 1932, Bruce Lee was born later than Johnny Cash.


      NO, Johnny Cash was not born later than Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee was born later
      than Johnny Cash.'

      Step 1: Determine when Coco Chanel was born.

      Coco Chanel (Gabrielle Bonheur Chanel) was born on August 19, 1883, in France.


      Step 2: Determine when Idi Amin was born.

      Idi Amin was born around 1925 in Uganda (some sources cite 1923-1928, but most
      commonly 1925).


      Step 3: Compare the two birth years.

      Coco Chanel: 1883

      Idi Amin: approximately 1925


      Step 4: Determine who was born later.

      1925 is 42 years after 1883, so Idi Amin was born significantly later than Coco
      Chanel.


      Since the question asks if Coco Chanel was born later than Idi Amin, and we''ve
      established that Idi Amin was actually born later than Coco Chanel:
