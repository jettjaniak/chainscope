      Step 1: Identify the ZIP codes and their locations.

      - 70130 is a ZIP code in New Orleans, Louisiana.

      - 10012 is a ZIP code in Manhattan, New York City, New York.


      Step 2: Understand the general context.

      - Manhattan is known as one of the most densely populated areas in the United
      States.

      - New Orleans, while it has urban areas, is generally less densely populated
      than Manhattan.


      Step 3: Find population and area data.

      While I can''t browse the internet, I can use known statistics:


      - ZIP code 10012 (Manhattan) includes parts of SoHo, NoHo, Greenwich Village,
      and other densely populated neighborhoods. As of recent estimates, it has a
      population density exceeding 40,000 people per square mile.

      - ZIP code 70130 (New Orleans) includes parts of the Garden District, Lower
      Garden District, and the French Quarter. Its population density is significantly
      lower than that of 10012, generally under 10,000 people per square mile.

      \ the areas of the ZIP codes.**\n\n- **70112, LA** is a ZIP code in New Orleans,\
      \ Louisiana. It covers part of the downtown area, including the Central Business\
      \ District (CBD). This area includes both commercial and residential buildings\
      \ but is not one of the most densely populated residential areas of New Orleans.\n\
      \n- **10025, NY** is a ZIP code in Manhattan, New York City. It includes parts\
      \ of the Upper West Side and is a densely populated residential area with many\
      \ apartment buildings.\n\n**Step 2: Consider population and land area.**\n\n\
      - According to U.S. Census and demographic data:\n  - **70112** has a relatively\
      \ low residential population due to its nature as a business district.\n  -\
      \ **10025** is one of the most densely populated ZIP codes in the U.S., with\

      **Step 1: Identify ZIP Code 94027**

      - ZIP code 94027 corresponds to Atherton, California.

      - Atherton is known for being one of the wealthiest towns in the United States
      with large residential lots and low population density.

      - The population is relatively small, and the area is spacious, resulting in
      a low population density.


      **Step 2: Identify ZIP Code 10013**

      - ZIP code 10013 covers parts of Manhattan in New York City, including Tribeca
      and parts of SoHo and Chinatown.

      - Manhattan is one of the most densely populated areas in the US.

      - Even neighborhood-level ZIP codes like 10013 have high population densities
      due to the prevalence of high-rise apartments and limited land area.


      **Step 3: Compare Population Densities**

      - Atherton (94027) has a low population density because it has fewer people
      living on large residential properties.

      - 10013 in Manhattan has a high population density due to the urban environment
      and multi-story residential buildings.


      **Conclusion**

      Given the urban nature of 10013 and the suburban, low-density character of 94027,
      it is clear that 94027 is not more densely populated than 10013.

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 70116 is a ZIP code in New Orleans, Louisiana. It includes parts of the French
      Quarter and nearby neighborhoods.

      - 10011 is a ZIP code in Manhattan, New York City. It includes parts of neighborhoods

      - Manhattan is one of the most densely populated areas in the United States.

      - New Orleans, while urban, is significantly less densely populated than Manhattan.


      Step 3: Look up or use known data for population densities.

      - ZIP code 70116: According to recent estimates, its population density is around
      7,000 to 8,000 people per square mile.

      - ZIP code 10011: Its population density is significantly higher, typically
      over 50,000 people per square mile.


      Step 4: Compare the two.

      - 10011 has a population density that is many times higher than that of 70116.

      Step 1: Identify the locations

      - ZIP code 70116 is located in New Orleans, Louisiana. It includes parts of

      - Manhattan, especially neighborhoods like Chelsea and the West Village, is
      known to be one of the most densely populated urban areas in the United States.

      - New Orleans is less densely populated overall compared to Manhattan, and while
      the French Quarter is a popular and historic area, it is not known for high
      residential density compared to Manhattan neighborhoods.


      Step 3: Refer to actual data (from sources like the U.S. Census Bureau or demographic

      \ California is more densely populated than 10007 in New York, we need to consider\
      \ the population density for each ZIP code. Population density is typically\
      \ measured as the number of people per square mile.\n\nStep 1: Identify the\
      \ ZIP codes and their locations.\n- 90028 is in Los Angeles, California, specifically\
      \ the Hollywood area.\n- 10007 is in Manhattan, New York City, specifically\
      \ in the Tribeca and Civic Center area.\n\nStep 2: Understand the general characteristics\
      \ of these areas.\n- 90028 (Hollywood) is a relatively densely populated urban\
      \ area, with a mix of residential and commercial zones.\n- 10007 (Tribeca/Civic\
      \ Center, Manhattan) is an extremely dense area, with high-rise residential\
      \ and commercial buildings, and Manhattan is known for having some of the highest\
      \ population densities in the US.\n\nStep 3: Look at estimated population and\
      \ land area data.\n- 90028 (Hollywood) has an estimated population of around\
      \ 39,000 people and covers approximately 2.9 square miles, giving a rough density\
      \ of about 13,400 people per square mile.\n- 10007 (Manhattan) has a smaller\
      \ population, estimated around 8,000-10,000 people, but occupies a very small\
      \ land area \u2014 approximately 0.3 square miles \u2014 which gives a population\
      \ density of roughly 30,000 people per square mile or more.\n\nStep 4: Compare\
      \ the densities.\n- 90028: ~13,400 people/sq mi\n- 10007: ~30,000+ people/sq\
      \ mi\n\nConclusion:\nAlthough 90028 has more people in total, 10007 is much\
      \ smaller in area and therefore has a higher population density.\n\nAnswer:\

      \ California is more densely populated than ZIP code 10007 in New York, we need\
      \ to compare the population density (people per square mile) of the two ZIP\
      \ codes.\n\nStep 1: Identify the locations.\n- ZIP code 90028 is in Los Angeles,\
      \ California, specifically in the Hollywood area.\n- ZIP code 10007 is in Lower\
      \ Manhattan, New York City, including parts of Tribeca and the Civic Center.\n\
      \nStep 2: Understand general population density trends.\n- Manhattan is the\

      \ area, population densities in Los Angeles ZIP codes tend to be lower than\
      \ those in Manhattan ZIP codes.\n\nStep 3: Look up or estimate the specific\
      \ population densities.\n- ZIP code 90028 (Hollywood, CA) has an estimated population\

      \ (Lower Manhattan, NY) has a smaller residential population but is extremely\

      \ density than 90028, even if it has a smaller total population, because of\
      \ its very small land area and concentrated residential buildings.\n\nFinal\

      \ proceed step by step:\n\nStep 1: Identify the location of each ZIP code.\n\
      - 90028 is located in Los Angeles, California, specifically the Hollywood area.\n\
