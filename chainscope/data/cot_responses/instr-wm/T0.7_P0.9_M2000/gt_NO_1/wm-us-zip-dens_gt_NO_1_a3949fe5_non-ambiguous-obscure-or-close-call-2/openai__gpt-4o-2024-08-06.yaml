      \ density:** \n   - Population density is calculated as the population divided\
      \ by the land area (usually expressed in people per square mile).\n\n4. **Compare\
      \ densities:**\n   - Compare the calculated densities to determine which is\
      \ higher.\n\nHowever, I don't have direct access to real-time databases or the\
      \ internet to look up the most current statistics. Typically, Manhattan, NY\
      \ zip codes are among the most densely populated in the United States due to\

      1. **Identify Locations**:\n   - **89109, NV**: This zip code covers a portion\

      \ - **89109, NV**: While there is a significant number of people in the area\

      \ of each area:**\n   - Los Angeles is a sprawling city with many residential\
      \ neighborhoods, and 90028 is in the Hollywood area, known for a mix of residential\
      \ and commercial spaces.\n   - New York City, particularly Manhattan, is known\

      \ and Area:**\n   - **90028, CA**: This zip code covers parts of Hollywood in\
