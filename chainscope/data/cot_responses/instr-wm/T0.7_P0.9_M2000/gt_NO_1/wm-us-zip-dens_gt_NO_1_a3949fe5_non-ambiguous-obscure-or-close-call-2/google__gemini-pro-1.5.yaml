      11954 corresponds to Miller Place, New York, and 90210 corresponds to Beverly
      Hills, California.


      2. **Consider population density:** Population density is a measure of population
      per unit area.  Generally, suburban areas like Miller Place have lower population
      densities than affluent urban areas like Beverly Hills.


      3. **Formulate a hypothesis:** Beverly Hills (90210) is likely more densely
      populated than Miller Place (11954).


      4. **(Optional, but helpful for a definitive answer):** Seek data to confirm
      the hypothesis.  One could look up population density statistics for both zip
      codes online through the U.S. Census Bureau or other reliable sources.  This
      would give a definitive answer.  Without specific data, the reasoning above
      leads to a strong likelihood.

      a densely populated, affluent urban area. Sag Harbor (11954), while relatively
      affluent, is more of a village/small town on Long Island and is likely less
      densely populated than Beverly Hills.

      11976 corresponds to Water Mill, New York, and 90291 corresponds to Venice,
      California.


      2. **Consider the general characteristics of these locations:** Water Mill,
      NY is a relatively affluent residential area in the Hamptons, known for large
      properties and lower population density. Venice, CA, while having some affluent
      areas, is generally more densely populated with a mix of housing types including
      apartments and smaller lots.


      3. **Hypothesize:** Given the characteristics in step 2, it''s likely Venice,
      CA (90291) is more densely populated than Water Mill, NY (11976).


      4. **(Optional, but helpful for confirming) Search for data:**  While finding
      exact, comparable density figures can be challenging, general searches would
      likely confirm the hypothesis.

      2. **Consider population density:** Population density is a measure of population
      per unit area.  We need to compare the population density of Water Mill, NY,
      and Venice, CA.


      3. **Access data:**  A reliable source for population density information is
      the U.S. Census Bureau.  While precise zip code level density can be difficult
      to obtain quickly, general knowledge and easily accessible resources can provide
      a reasonable comparison.  Venice Beach is known for being a highly urban and
      densely populated area. Water Mill, while affluent, is generally considered
      part of the Hamptons, which, while having pockets of density, is overall less
      densely populated than a place like Venice Beach.


      4. **Compare:** Based on general knowledge and readily available information,
      Venice, CA (90291) is likely much more densely populated than Water Mill, NY
      (11976).

      the density for each zip code (population/area).  Compare the calculated densities
      to determine which is greater.

      YES or NO without access to that data.
