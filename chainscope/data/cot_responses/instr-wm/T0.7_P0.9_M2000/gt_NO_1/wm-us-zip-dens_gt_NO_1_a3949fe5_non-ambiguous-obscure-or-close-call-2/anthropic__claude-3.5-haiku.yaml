      1. 94043 is a zip code in Mountain View, California, located in Santa Clara
      County (Silicon Valley)

      - This is a suburban/tech area with a mix of residential and office complexes

      - Mountain View has a population density of about 4,000 people per square mile


      2. 10003 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York City, specifically in the East
      Village neighborhood

      - Manhattan is known for being extremely densely populated

      - Manhattan''s overall population density is around 70,000 people per square
      mile

      - The East Village is particularly dense, with many apartment buildings and
      multi-story residences


      3. Comparing the population densities:

      - Manhattan (10003): ~70,000 people per square mile

      - Mountain View (94043): ~4,000 people per square mile


      4. Conclusion: Manhattan''s zip code 10003 is significantly more densely populated
      than Mountain View''s zip code 94043.
