      is located north of Seattle, WA, I need to recall the approximate locations
      of these two major US cities.


      Los Angeles is located in Southern California, near the coast of the Pacific
      Ocean. It''s in the southwestern United States.


      Seattle is located in Washington state, which is in the northwestern United
      States, also on the Pacific coast.


      In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):

      - Seattle is very far north in the continental US, near the Canadian border

      - Los Angeles is much further south in California


      The continental United States generally has states arranged with more northern
      states being higher in latitude (more north) than southern states. Washington
      state is one of the northernmost states in the continental US, while Southern
      California is much further south.


      So Seattle is located north of Los Angeles, not the other way around. Los Angeles
      is NOT north of Seattle.</think>I need to determine the relative geographic
      positions of Los Angeles, CA and Seattle, WA.


      Step 1: Recall the locations of both cities.

      - Los Angeles is located in Southern California, on the Pacific coast.

      - Seattle is located in Washington state, also on the Pacific coast.


      Step 2: Compare their latitudes (north-south positions).

      - Seattle is in Washington state, which is one of the northernmost states in
      the continental US, bordering Canada.

      - Los Angeles is in Southern California, which is much further south.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Seattle is significantly further north than Los Angeles on the map of the United
      States. California is south of Washington state.
