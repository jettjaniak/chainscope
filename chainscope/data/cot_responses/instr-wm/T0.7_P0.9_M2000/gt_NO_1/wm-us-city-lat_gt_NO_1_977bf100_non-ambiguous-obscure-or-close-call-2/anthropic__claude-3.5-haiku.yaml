      \n2. Atlanta is located in Georgia, which is in the southeastern part of the\
      \ United States.\n\n3. Chicago is located in Illinois, which is in the midwestern\
      \ part of the United States.\n\n4. Specifically, Atlanta is at approximately\
      \ 33.7\xB0 N latitude.\n\n5. Chicago is at approximately 41.9\xB0 N latitude.\n\
      \n6. Since a higher latitude means a more northerly location, and Chicago has\
      \ a higher latitude than Atlanta, Chicago is located further north.\n\n7. Therefore,\
      \ Atlanta is NOT located north of Chicago.\n\nAnswer: NO"
