      Step 1: Recall the geographic position of Los Angeles, CA.

      Los Angeles is located in southern California, near the Pacific coast.


      Step 2: Recall the geographic position of Seattle, WA.

      Seattle is located in the northwestern part of Washington state, also near the
      Pacific coast.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      Washington state is located entirely north of California.

      Seattle is in the northern part of Washington state.

      Los Angeles is in the southern part of California.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on these positions.

      Since Washington state is north of California, and Seattle is in Washington
      while Los Angeles is in California, Seattle must be north of Los Angeles.


      NO, Los Angeles is not located north of Seattle. Los Angeles is south of Seattle.'
