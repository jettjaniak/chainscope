      the relative geographic positions of University of California, Santa Barbara
      (UCSB) and Stanford University in California.


      Step 1: Recall the location of UCSB.

      UCSB is located in Santa Barbara, California, which is on the central California
      coast.


      Step 2: Recall the location of Stanford University.

      Stanford University is located in Stanford, California, near Palo Alto in the
      San Francisco Bay Area.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      Going up the California coast from south to north:

      - San Diego is in southern California

      - Los Angeles is in southern California

      - Santa Barbara is in central California

      - San Francisco Bay Area (including Stanford) is in northern California


      Stanford is located near San Francisco, which is north of Santa Barbara on the

      Therefore, UCSB is NOT north of Stanford. UCSB is south of Stanford.
