      Duke University is located in Durham, North Carolina.

      University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.


      Now I need to determine which is further north. Let me think about the general
      geography of the US east coast:


      - Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina

      - Philadelphia, PA is in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania

      - Durham, NC is in the central part of North Carolina


      Generally, states on the US east coast are arranged from north to south as follows
      (among the relevant ones):

      - Pennsylvania (more north)

      - North Carolina (more south)


      This means Philadelphia, PA (where UPenn is) should be north of Durham, NC (where
      Duke is).


      Therefore, Duke University in NC is NOT located north of University of Pennsylvania
      in PA. Instead, UPenn is north of Duke.</think>I need to compare the north-south

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Duke University is in Durham, North Carolina

      - University of Pennsylvania is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania


      Step 2: Compare the states geographically.

      On the U.S. east coast, Pennsylvania is significantly north of North Carolina.
      Pennsylvania borders New York to its north, while North Carolina is several
      states south, below Virginia.


      Step 3: Check the specific cities.

      Philadelphia is in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania, while Durham is in
      the central part of North Carolina. Even though Philadelphia is in the southern
      part of Pennsylvania, it''s still much further north than any part of North
      Carolina.


      NO, the Graduate School of Duke University in NC is NOT located north of University
      of Pennsylvania in PA. Duke is south of UPenn.'

      1. Duke University is located in Durham, North Carolina (NC).

      Manhattan, NYC is in the southeastern part of New York State.

      Ithaca is in the central-to-western part of upstate New York, significantly
      north of NYC.


      In terms of latitude, Ithaca (where Cornell''s main campus and College of Veterinary

      Therefore, the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University
      is NOT located north of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.</think>#
      Is School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, NY located
      north of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, NY?


      I need to determine the geographical locations of both institutions and compare
      their positions.


      Step 1: Locate Columbia University''s School of International and Public Affairs
      (SIPA).

      - Columbia University is located in Manhattan, New York City

      - SIPA is on Columbia''s main campus in the Morningside Heights neighborhood
      of Upper Manhattan


      Step 2: Locate Cornell University''s College of Veterinary Medicine.

      - Cornell University''s main campus is in Ithaca, New York

      - The College of Veterinary Medicine is located on this main campus in Ithaca


      Step 3: Compare the north-south positions of these locations.

      - New York City (where Columbia is) is in the southeastern part of New York
      State

      - Ithaca (where Cornell is) is in the central part of upstate New York

      - In terms of latitude, Ithaca is significantly north of New York City


      NO - Columbia University''s School of International and Public Affairs is not
      located north of Cornell University''s College of Veterinary Medicine.'

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States

      - Virginia is in the mid-Atlantic/southeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on a north-south axis.

      - Massachusetts is further north than Virginia on the US map

      UVA is located in Charlottesville, Virginia (VA).

      MIT is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts (MA).


      To determine which is further north, I need to compare their latitudes:


      Virginia is a state in the southern United States, while Massachusetts is in
      the northeastern United States. In general, Massachusetts is north of Virginia.


      Cambridge, MA (where MIT is located) is in the eastern part of Massachusetts.

      Charlottesville, VA (where UVA is located) is in central Virginia.


      Given the general geography of the United States, Massachusetts is north of
      Virginia, so MIT in Cambridge, MA would be north of UVA in Charlottesville,
      VA.


      So UVA is NOT located north of MIT. UVA is south of MIT.</think>To answer this

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Virginia is a southern state, positioned in the mid-Atlantic region

      - Massachusetts is a northeastern state, part of New England


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on the north-south axis.

      - Massachusetts is significantly further north than Virginia

      - Cambridge, MA is therefore north of Charlottesville, VA


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion about the specific universities.

      Since MIT is in Massachusetts (a northern state) and UVA is in Virginia (a more
      southern state), UVA cannot be north of MIT.


      NO, University of Virginia is not located north of Massachusetts Institute of

      So Stanford is north of UCSB, not the other way around. UCSB is NOT north of
      Stanford.</think>Let me think about the locations of these two universities

      coast, northwest of Los Angeles.

      Stanford University is located in Stanford, California, which is in the San

      Santa Barbara is located further south along the California coast compared to
