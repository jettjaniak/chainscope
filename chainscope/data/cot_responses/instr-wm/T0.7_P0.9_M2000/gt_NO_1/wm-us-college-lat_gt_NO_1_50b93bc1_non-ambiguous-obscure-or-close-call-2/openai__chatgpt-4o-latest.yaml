      1. **Duke University** is located in Durham, North Carolina.

      2. **University of Pennsylvania** is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.


      Now, let''s think geographically:


      - North Carolina is part of the southeastern United States.

      - Pennsylvania is part of the northeastern United States.

      - Specifically, Philadelphia is situated at a higher latitude than Durham.


      Therefore, in terms of latitude:


      - Philadelphia, PA (University of Pennsylvania) is located further north than
      Durham, NC (Duke University).


      **Conclusion:** Duke University is located south of the University of Pennsylvania.

      California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) is located north of Stanford University, we
      need to consider their geographical positions in California.


      Step 1: Identify the location of Stanford University.

      - Stanford University is located in Stanford, California, which is adjacent
      to Palo Alto in the San Francisco Bay Area.

      - This places Stanford in Northern California.


      Step 2: Identify the location of University of California, Santa Barbara.

      - UCSB is located in Santa Barbara, California.

      - Santa Barbara is situated along the southern coast of California, northwest
      of Los Angeles.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Santa Barbara is in Southern California, while Stanford is in Northern California.

      - In terms of latitude, Santa Barbara is farther south than Stanford.


      Conclusion:

      Since UCSB is located south of Stanford University, it is not north of Stanford.
