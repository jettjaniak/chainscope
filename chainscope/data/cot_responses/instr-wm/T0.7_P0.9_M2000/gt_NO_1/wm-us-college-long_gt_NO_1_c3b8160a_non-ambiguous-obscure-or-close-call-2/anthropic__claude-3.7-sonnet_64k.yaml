    1f2a447f-8eab-4685-87dd-731d50fb86cb: '<think>This question is asking about the
      relative geographic positions of Stanford University in California and Johns
      Hopkins University in Maryland.


      To determine whether Stanford University is located east of Johns Hopkins University,
      I need to think about their locations within the United States.


      Stanford University is located in Stanford, California, which is on the west
      coast of the United States.


      Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland, which is on the
      east coast of the United States.


      In the United States, the east coast is definitely east of the west coast. California
      is on the west coast, while Maryland is on the east coast. So Stanford (in California)
      is west of Johns Hopkins (in Maryland), not east of it.


      Another way to think about this is to consider the general geographic layout
      of the United States. Going from west to east, we have:

      - West Coast (including California)

      - Mountain states

      - Midwest

      - East Coast (including Maryland)


      So Stanford University in California is definitely west of Johns Hopkins University
      in Maryland, not east of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO, Stanford University is not located east of Johns
      Hopkins University.</think>To answer this question, I need to consider the geographic
      locations of both universities.


      Step 1: Identify where each university is located.

      - Stanford University is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the
      United States.

      - Johns Hopkins University is in Maryland (MD), which is on the east coast of
      the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic orientation of the United States.

      - In the US, the states on the west coast (like California) are west of the
      states on the east coast (like Maryland).

      - Moving from west to east across the US, you would go from California through
      the middle states to reach Maryland.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Since Stanford is in California (west coast) and Johns Hopkins is in Maryland
      (east coast), Stanford is west of Johns Hopkins, not east of it.


      NO'

      University in California is located east of Johns Hopkins University in Maryland.


      To solve this, I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these
      two universities. In the United States, locations further east have higher longitude
      values (going from west to east, longitude increases).


      Let me think about the general locations:


      1. Stanford University is located in Stanford, California, which is on the west
      coast of the United States.

      2. Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland, which is on the
      east coast of the United States.


      Generally speaking, the east coast (including Maryland) is east of the west
      coast (including California). That means California is west of Maryland, not
      east of it.


      So Stanford University (in California) would be WEST of Johns Hopkins University
      (in Maryland), not east of it.


      Therefore, the answer to "Is Stanford University, CA located east of Johns Hopkins
      University, MD?" is NO.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positioning
      of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Stanford University is located in Stanford, California, on the west coast
      of the United States.

      - Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland, on the east coast
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the United States.

      - The U.S. mainland spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean
      (east).

      - California is a west coast state bordering the Pacific Ocean.

      - Maryland is an east coast state near the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Moving from west to east across the continental U.S., you would encounter
      California first, then Maryland much later.

      - Therefore, Stanford (in California) is west of Johns Hopkins (in Maryland),
      not east of it.

      - Maryland is a state on the east coast, near the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Since California is on the west coast and Maryland is on the east coast, California

      I need to think about the geographic locations of these two universities:

      3. In U.S. geography, California is significantly west of Maryland - the entire
      continental United States sits between them.

      4. When considering east/west positioning, Maryland is closer to the Atlantic
      Ocean (east), while California is closer to the Pacific Ocean (west).


      Since Stanford (California) is on the west coast and Johns Hopkins (Maryland)
      is on the east coast, Stanford is located WEST of Johns Hopkins, not east.

      To determine this, I need to consider the geographic locations of both universities:


      1. Vanderbilt University is located in Nashville, Tennessee.

      2. Virginia Tech is located in Blacksburg, Virginia.


      Now I need to compare their relative east-west positions. In the United States,
      locations further east have higher longitude values (when expressed as positive
      numbers, as is conventional for the Western Hemisphere).


      Tennessee is generally west of Virginia. Virginia borders the Atlantic Ocean
      on its eastern side, while Tennessee is an inland state that doesn''t reach
      the Atlantic coast.


      Looking at their specific locations:

      - Nashville, TN (where Vanderbilt is located) is in the central part of Tennessee

      - Blacksburg, VA (where Virginia Tech is located) is in the western part of
      Virginia


      Even though Blacksburg is in western Virginia, Virginia as a whole is east of
      Tennessee. The eastern edge of Tennessee roughly aligns with the western portion
      of Virginia.


      So Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN would be WEST of Virginia Tech in
      Blacksburg, VA - not east of it.

      - Tennessee is positioned to the west of Virginia

      - Virginia borders the Atlantic Ocean on its east side, while Tennessee is more
      inland


      Step 3: Consider the specific locations within their states.

      - Nashville is in the central part of Tennessee

      - Blacksburg is in the western part of Virginia

      Let me think about the general geographic positions of California and Wisconsin
      in the United States:


      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Wisconsin is in the Midwest, much further east than California


      Specifically:

      - Los Angeles, CA is in southern California on the west coast

      - Madison, WI is in southern Wisconsin in the Midwest


      Even without exact longitude coordinates, I know that all of California is west
      of all of Wisconsin. The entire state of California lies west of Wisconsin.


      Since UCLA is in Los Angeles, California, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison
      is in Madison, Wisconsin, UCLA must be west of UW-Madison.


      If UCLA is west of UW-Madison, then UCLA is NOT east of UW-Madison.


      So the answer is NO, UCLA is not located east of University of Wisconsin-Madison
      College of Engineering.</think># Is UCLA east of UW-Madison College of Engineering?


      I need to consider the geographic locations of these two universities:


      1) University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) is located in Los Angeles, California,
      on the west coast of the United States.


      2) University of Wisconsin-Madison College of Engineering is located in Madison,
      Wisconsin, in the Midwest region of the United States.


      3) Geographically, California is significantly west of Wisconsin on the U.S.
      map. The entire state of California lies west of Wisconsin.


      4) Moving from west to east across the United States, you would encounter California
      first, then eventually Wisconsin (with several states in between).


      Since UCLA is in California (west) and UW-Madison is in Wisconsin (east), UCLA
      cannot be east of UW-Madison.

      Let me think about the general geography of the United States:

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast


      To be more specific:

      - The University of Michigan is in Ann Arbor, Michigan

      - Duke University is in Durham, North Carolina


      Now I need to determine which one is further east (has a greater longitude coordinate

      Michigan is positioned around the Great Lakes region, while North Carolina is
      on the Atlantic coast. Generally, states on the Atlantic coast are eastward
      of the Midwest states.


      If we look at a map of the United States, we would see that North Carolina is

      Step 1: Let me identify where both universities are located.

      - Syracuse University is located in Syracuse, New York

      - Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts


      Step 2: Now I need to determine which is further east. In the United States,
      locations further east have higher longitude values (when expressed as positive
      numbers in the Western Hemisphere).


      The east coast of the US follows roughly a northeast to southwest orientation,
      with Maine being the northeasternmost state, and Florida being in the southeast.
      New York State is west of Massachusetts, though their relative positions depend
      on which parts of each state we''re comparing.


      Syracuse is in central/western New York State, while Cambridge (where MIT is)
      is in eastern Massachusetts, near Boston.


      Step 3: Let me think about the geography more specifically:

      - Massachusetts is generally east of New York State

      - Boston/Cambridge is on the eastern coast of Massachusetts

      - Syracuse is not on the eastern edge of New York, but rather in the central/western
      part of the state


      Given these geographic facts, Syracuse should be west of MIT/Cambridge, not
      east of it.


      To confirm this, if I were to travel from Syracuse to MIT, I would generally
      need to travel eastward.

      First, let me establish the locations:


      1. Syracuse University is located in Syracuse, New York.

      2. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.


      Now I need to determine which one is further east. In the United States, being
      "more east" generally means having a higher longitude value (or being closer
      to the east coast).


      Massachusetts is a state on the east coast of the United States, while New York
      is also on the east coast but extends further inland to the west. However, the
      specific locations of these universities within their states is what matters.


      Syracuse is located in central New York state, while Cambridge (where MIT is)
      is located in eastern Massachusetts, right next to Boston on the coast.


      Looking at a mental map of the northeastern United States:

      - Syracuse is in central New York, somewhat away from the coast

      - Cambridge/Boston is on the eastern coast of Massachusetts


      Massachusetts is generally east of New York state, especially when comparing
      the eastern part of Massachusetts (where MIT is) to central New York (where

      So Syracuse University is west of MIT, not east of it.


      Therefore, the answer is NO - Syracuse University is NOT located east of Massachusetts
      Institute of Technology.


      To verify more precisely, I''d typically check the exact longitude coordinates

      - Syracuse is located in central New York state, well inland from the coast


      ## Step 3: Compare relative positions

      - Even though both are in northeastern states, Syracuse is situated significantly
      west of Cambridge

      - Central New York is geographically west of eastern Massachusetts

      - Moving from Syracuse to Cambridge would require traveling eastward

      geographic locations of two US colleges: Syracuse University in New York (NY)
      and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Massachusetts (MA). I need
      to determine if Syracuse is east of MIT.


      To solve this, I need to know the approximate locations of these institutions:


      1. Syracuse University is located in Syracuse, NY

      2. MIT is located in Cambridge, MA (adjacent to Boston)


      Now I need to recall the relative positions of these locations on the US map.


      Massachusetts is a state in the northeastern United States, on the Atlantic
      coast. New York state is directly west of Massachusetts.


      Syracuse is a city in central New York state, while Cambridge/Boston is in eastern
      Massachusetts, near the coast.


      Since New York state is west of Massachusetts, and Syracuse is in central New
      York (not even eastern NY), Syracuse must be west of MIT which is in eastern
      Massachusetts.


      So Syracuse University is NOT east of MIT. It''s west of MIT.


      The answer is NO, Syracuse University is not located east of Massachusetts Institute

      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - Syracuse University is in Syracuse, New York

      - Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is in Cambridge, Massachusetts
      (near Boston)


      ## Step 2: Recall the geographic relationship between these states

      - Massachusetts is on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States

      - New York state is positioned to the west of Massachusetts


      ## Step 3: Consider the specific locations within these states

      - Syracuse is located in central New York state

      - Cambridge/Boston is in eastern Massachusetts, near the coast


      ## Step 4: Compare the east-west positions

      Since Syracuse is in central New York (which is already west of Massachusetts),
      and MIT is in eastern Massachusetts (close to the easternmost part of the mainland
      US), Syracuse University must be west of MIT, not east.

      Therefore, Boston, MA is significantly east of San Francisco, CA. This means
      that Boston University is east of UCSF, not the other way around.


      So to answer the question: "Is University of California, San Francisco, CA located

      1) University of California, San Francisco is located in San Francisco, California,
      which is on the west coast of the United States.


      2) Boston University is located in Boston, Massachusetts, which is on the east

      3) In terms of US geography, the continental United States spans from the Pacific
      Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean (east).


      4) California is a Pacific coast state, while Massachusetts is an Atlantic coast
      state.


      5) Therefore, San Francisco is significantly west of Boston, not east of it.

      - California is on the western side of the country, while Massachusetts is on
      the eastern side.

      - San Francisco is west of Boston, not east.

      1. I need to determine the location (longitude) of Arizona State University
      (ASU) in Arizona.

      2. I need to determine the location (longitude) of Harvard Summer School in
      Massachusetts.

      3. Then I can compare their longitudes to determine which is further east.


      For reference, in the United States, eastern locations have a higher longitude
      (less negative or closer to 0 when expressed in decimal degrees) than western
      locations.


      Arizona State University is located in Tempe, Arizona, which is in the southwestern
      United States. Arizona is significantly west of Massachusetts.


      Harvard Summer School is part of Harvard University, which is located in Cambridge,
      Massachusetts, on the east coast of the United States.


      Given the geography of the United States, Massachusetts is much further east
      than Arizona. So Harvard Summer School is east of Arizona State University,
      not the other way around.


      Therefore, the answer to "Is Arizona State University, AZ located east of Harvard
      Summer School, MA?" is NO. Arizona State University is west of Harvard Summer
      School, not east of it.</think># Is Arizona State University, AZ located east
      of Harvard Summer School, MA?


      I need to compare the geographical locations of these two institutions.


      Step 1: Determine where each university is located.

      - Arizona State University is in Tempe, Arizona, in the southwestern United
      States.

      - Harvard Summer School is in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on the eastern seaboard.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on the U.S. map.

      - The United States spans from west to east, with the Pacific coast being the
      westernmost region and the Atlantic coast being the easternmost.

      - Arizona is in the western half of the country.

      - Massachusetts is on the east coast.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Massachusetts is much farther east than Arizona.

      - Therefore, Harvard Summer School (in Massachusetts) is east of Arizona State
      University (in Arizona), not the other way around.


      NO, Arizona State University is not located east of Harvard Summer School. It
      is west of it.'

      Columbia University is located in Manhattan, New York City, which is in the
      southeastern part of New York state. The School of International and Public
      Affairs would be on Columbia''s main campus in Manhattan.


      Now, to determine which is further east, I need to consider their relative positions
      on a map. New York City (Manhattan) is located in the southeastern part of New
      York state, while Ithaca is in the central/western part of the state.


      On a map of New York state, New York City is further east than Ithaca. Therefore,
      Columbia University (in Manhattan) is east of Cornell University (in Ithaca).


      This means that Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine is NOT east
      of the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University. It''s
      the opposite - Columbia''s school is east of Cornell''s school.


      So the answer is NO, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine is not
      located east of the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University.</think>#
      Determining the East-West Relationship of Two NY Universities


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions
      of these two institutions.


      ## Step 1: Locate Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine

      Cornell University''s main campus, including its College of Veterinary Medicine,
      is located in Ithaca, NY, in the central/western part of New York state.


      ## Step 2: Locate Columbia University''s School of International and Public
      Affairs

      Columbia University, including its School of International and Public Affairs,
      is located in Manhattan, New York City, in the southeastern part of New York
      state.


      ## Step 3: Compare their east-west positions

      Looking at a map of New York state:

      - Ithaca (Cornell) is in central/western New York

      - Manhattan (Columbia) is in eastern New York


      New York City is significantly east of Ithaca. Therefore, Columbia''s school
      is east of Cornell''s veterinary college, not the other way around.

      \ to figure out the relative locations of Cornell University College of Veterinary\
      \ Medicine in NY and the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia\
      \ University, NY.\n\nFirst, let me determine where each institution is located:\n\
      \n1. Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine is in Ithaca, NY, which\
      \ is in the Finger Lakes region in central New York state.\n\n2. The School\
      \ of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) at Columbia University is located\
      \ at Columbia's main campus in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan,\
      \ New York City.\n\nNow I need to determine which is further east. In the United\
      \ States, being further east means having a longitude with a higher negative\
      \ value (closer to 0).\n\nIthaca, NY is in central New York state, while New\
      \ York City is on the eastern edge of the state. Looking at a map:\n\n- Ithaca\
      \ (where Cornell's Veterinary College is) is approximately at longitude -76.5\xB0\
      \ W\n- New York City (where Columbia's SIPA is) is approximately at longitude\
      \ -74\xB0 W\n\nSince -74 is greater than -76.5 (i.e., -74 is closer to 0), New\
      \ York City is further east than Ithaca.\n\nTherefore, Cornell University College\
      \ of Veterinary Medicine (in Ithaca) is NOT located east of the School of International\
      \ and Public Affairs at Columbia University (in NYC). In fact, it's the opposite\
      \ - Cornell's Veterinary College is west of Columbia's SIPA.\n\nActually, let\
      \ me double-check the exact locations to be sure:\n\nCornell University College\
      \ of Veterinary Medicine is indeed in Ithaca, NY at approximately longitude\
      \ -76.5\xB0 W.\n\nThe School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia\
      \ University is in Manhattan, New York City, at approximately longitude -73.96\xB0\
      \ W.\n\nSo Columbia's SIPA is further east than Cornell's Veterinary College.\n\
      \nThe answer is NO.</think># Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1) First, I need to identify\
      \ the exact locations of both institutions:\n   - Cornell University College\
      \ of Veterinary Medicine is located in Ithaca, NY, in the Finger Lakes region\
      \ of central New York state.\n   - The School of International and Public Affairs\
      \ at Columbia University is located in Manhattan, New York City, in the eastern\
      \ part of New York state.\n\n2) To determine which is further east, I need to\
      \ compare their positions on a map:\n   - Ithaca (Cornell) is located at approximately\
      \ longitude 76.5\xB0 West\n   - Manhattan (Columbia) is located at approximately\
      \ longitude 74.0\xB0 West\n\n3) On a map of the United States, east corresponds\
      \ to lower west longitude values (closer to 0):\n   - 74.0\xB0 West is further\
      \ east than 76.5\xB0 West\n   - This means New York City is east of Ithaca\n\
      \n4) Therefore, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine is located\
      \ WEST of the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University,\
      \ not east.\n\nNO"

      \ which is further east: Ithaca, NY or Manhattan, NYC.\n\nNew York City (Manhattan)\
      \ is located in the southeastern part of New York State, on the eastern coast\
      \ of the United States.\n\nIthaca is located in the central part of New York\
      \ State, in the Finger Lakes region.\n\nIf we look at a map of New York State,\
      \ New York City is significantly to the east of Ithaca. This means that Columbia\

      \ Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine is NOT located east of the\
      \ School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University. The opposite\

      \ with coordinates:\n- Ithaca, NY (where Cornell is located) is roughly at longitude\
      \ 76.5\xB0 W\n- New York City (where Columbia is located) is roughly at longitude\
      \ 74.0\xB0 W\n\nSince a smaller western longitude number means further east\
      \ in the northern hemisphere, this confirms that New York City (Columbia) is\
      \ east of Ithaca (Cornell).\n\nSo the answer is NO, Cornell University College\

      \ NY is approximately at longitude 76.5\xB0 W\n   - Manhattan, NYC is approximately\
      \ at longitude 74.0\xB0 W\n\n4. Since a smaller western longitude number indicates\
      \ a more easterly position, New York City is east of Ithaca.\n\n5. Therefore,\
      \ Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs is east of Cornell's\
      \ College of Veterinary Medicine, not the other way around.\n\nNO"
