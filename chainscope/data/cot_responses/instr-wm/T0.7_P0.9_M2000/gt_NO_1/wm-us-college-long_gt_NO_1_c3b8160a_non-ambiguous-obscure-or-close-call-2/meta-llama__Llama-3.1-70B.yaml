      \   - Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine is in Ithaca, New York\
      \ (NY).\n   - School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University\
      \ is in New York City, New York (NY).\n\n2. **Understand the geography**:\n\
      \   - Ithaca, NY is in the central part of the state, while New York City is\
      \ in the southeastern part.\n\n3. **Compare the locations**:\n   - Since New\
      \ York City is east of Ithaca, the School of International and Public Affairs,\
      \ Columbia University is east of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\
      \nBased on the steps above, the answer is: **YES**"

      \ University College of Veterinary Medicine, NY is located east of School of\
      \ International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, NY, we need to consider\
      \ the geographical locations of both institutions.\n\n1. **Identify the location\
      \ of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine**: Cornell University\
      \ is located in Ithaca, New York. Ithaca is in the Finger Lakes region of New\
