    127beba0-c6cd-40b7-8edd-5c21d36b8f83: '<think>Let me think about this geographically.


      Stanford University is located in Stanford, California, which is near Palo Alto
      in the San Francisco Bay Area on the west coast of the United States.


      Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland, which is on the
      east coast of the United States.


      The United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean
      (east). California is a west coast state bordering the Pacific Ocean, while
      Maryland is an east coast state near the Atlantic Ocean.


      So geographically:

      - Stanford (California) is on the west coast

      - Johns Hopkins (Maryland) is on the east coast


      Therefore, Stanford is west of Johns Hopkins, not east of it.</think># Is Stanford
      University, CA located east of Johns Hopkins University, MD?


      To answer this question, I need to identify the geographic locations of both
      universities and compare their positions along the east-west axis.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) Stanford University is located in Stanford, California, which is in the San
      Francisco Bay Area on the west coast of the United States.


      2) Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland, which is on the
      east coast of the United States.


      3) Moving from west to east across the continental United States, you would
      encounter California before Maryland.


      4) Therefore, Stanford University (CA) is located to the WEST of Johns Hopkins
      University (MD), not to the east.


      ## Answer: NO


      Stanford University is not located east of Johns Hopkins University. It is located
      west of Johns Hopkins.'

      to determine the relative east-west positions of Stanford University in California
      and Johns Hopkins University in Maryland.


      Step 1: Let me recall where these universities are located.

      - Stanford University is in Stanford, California, which is near Palo Alto in
      the San Francisco Bay Area on the west coast of the United States.

      - Johns Hopkins University is in Baltimore, Maryland, which is on the east coast
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic orientation of the United States.

      - The west coast (California) is generally considered the western edge of the
      continental US.

      - The east coast (including Maryland) is the eastern edge of the continental
      US.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      California is on the west coast, while Maryland is on the east coast. This means
      that Stanford (in California) is west of Johns Hopkins (in Maryland), not east
      of it.

      the San Francisco Bay Area on the West Coast of the United States.

      - Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland, on the East Coast
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions on a map of the United States.

      - California is on the west side of the continental United States.

      - Maryland is on the east side of the continental United States.

      - When looking at a map, Maryland is clearly east of California.


      Step 3: Determine the relative position.

      Since Stanford is in California (west) and Johns Hopkins is in Maryland (east),
      Stanford must be west of Johns Hopkins, not east of it.


      NO, Stanford University is not located east of Johns Hopkins University.'

      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Illinois is in the Midwest of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - States on the west coast (like California) are generally westward of midwestern

      So I need to compare the longitude values of these two universities.


      Without looking up the exact coordinates, I can reason that Virginia is significantly
      east of Texas on the US map. Virginia borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east
      coast, while Texas is much further west, bordering the Gulf of Mexico in the

      - Looking at a map of the US, Virginia is clearly east of Texas


      Step 4: Form a conclusion based on these geographic facts.

      Since Texas is west of Virginia, Texas A&M University must be west of (not east

      2. Northeastern University in Massachusetts (MA)


      I need to think about their geographic locations. Let me recall where these
      states are located:


      - Pennsylvania (PA) is in the Mid-Atlantic region

      - Massachusetts (MA) is in New England (northeastern part of the US)


      Generally, Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania. But I need to be more specific
      about these universities'' locations:


      - University of Pennsylvania is in Philadelphia, which is in the eastern part
      of Pennsylvania

      - Northeastern University is in Boston, which is on the eastern coast of Massachusetts


      Now I need to compare the eastward position of Philadelphia, PA versus Boston,
      MA.


      Boston is located on the Atlantic coast in the eastern part of Massachusetts.

      Philadelphia is near the Delaware River in the eastern part of Pennsylvania,
      but not directly on the Atlantic Ocean.


      In terms of longitude (east-west position), Boston is further east than Philadelphia.
      This means that Northeastern University in Boston, MA would be east of University
      of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA.


      So UPenn is NOT east of Northeastern University. Rather, Northeastern University
      is east of UPenn.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine the geographic
      positions of both universities.

      - University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

      - Northeastern University is located in Boston, Massachusetts


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these cities on the US East Coast.

      - Philadelphia is located in eastern Pennsylvania

      - Boston is located in eastern Massachusetts


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Boston is further east on the Atlantic coast than Philadelphia

      - Massachusetts is generally east of Pennsylvania on the map


      Step 4: Make my conclusion based on longitude.

      - Boston (where Northeastern is located) is east of Philadelphia (where UPenn
      is located)

      - Therefore, UPenn is west of Northeastern, not east of it

      the relative east-west positions of two universities:

      1. University of Phoenix in Arizona (AZ)

      2. Florida State University in Florida (FL)


      I need to think about the geographic positions of these states within the US.


      Arizona is in the southwestern part of the United States, bordering California
      to the west, Nevada to the northwest, Utah to the north, New Mexico to the east,
      and Mexico to the south.


      Florida is in the southeastern part of the United States, located on a peninsula
      between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.


      When considering east-west positioning in the US, states further east have higher
      longitude values (closer to the Atlantic), while states further west have lower
      longitude values (closer to the Pacific).


      Florida is significantly east of Arizona on a US map. Florida is one of the
      easternmost states, while Arizona is in the western half of the country.


      Therefore, University of Phoenix in Arizona is located WEST of Florida State
      University in Florida, not east of it.</think>To answer this question, I need
      to consider the geographic locations of these two universities and their respective
      states.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - University of Phoenix is in Phoenix, Arizona (AZ)

      - Florida State University is in Tallahassee, Florida (FL)


      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions of these states on the US map.

      - Arizona is located in the southwestern United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States


      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship.

      - On a US map, Florida is significantly east of Arizona

      - In terms of longitude, Florida has a higher (more easterly) value than Arizona


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - University of Phoenix (in Arizona) is west of Florida State University (in
      Florida)

      - Therefore, University of Phoenix is NOT east of Florida State University

      1. University of Michigan is in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which is in the Midwest
      region of the United States.

      2. Duke University is in Durham, North Carolina, which is on the East Coast

      In terms of east-west positioning in the US:

      - States on the East Coast (like North Carolina) are generally further east
      than Midwestern states (like Michigan).

      - On a map of the US, North Carolina would be to the right (east) of Michigan.

      - Duke University is in Durham, North Carolina


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Michigan and North Carolina within

      - Michigan is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - States on the East Coast (like North Carolina) are generally further east
      than Midwestern states (like Michigan)

      - Michigan is in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United States

      - North Carolina is on the East Coast of the United States


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - Michigan is further west compared to North Carolina

      - North Carolina is further east compared to Michigan

      1. The University of Texas at Austin is located in Austin, Texas (TX)

      2. Duke University is located in Durham, North Carolina (NC)


      Now I need to determine which is further east. In the United States, states
      that are further east have a lower longitude value.


      North Carolina is on the east coast of the United States, while Texas is in
      the south-central part of the country. North Carolina is definitely east of
      Texas.


      Therefore, Duke University (in North Carolina) is east of the University of
      Texas at Austin (in Texas).


      The question asks if UT Austin is east of Duke. Since Duke is east of UT Austin
      (not the other way around), the answer is NO.</think>I need to determine the
      relative east-west positions of these two universities by examining their locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      (TX)

      - Graduate School of Duke University is in Durham, North Carolina (NC)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states within the US.

      - Texas is located in the south-central United States

      - North Carolina is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - North Carolina is significantly further east than Texas

      - States on the east coast (like NC) are east of inland states like Texas

      - Looking at a US map, North Carolina has a longitude that is east of Texas


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since North Carolina is east of Texas, Duke University (in NC) is east of UT
      Austin (in TX), not the other way around.

      by step:


      1. I need to determine the relative east-west positions of Syracuse University

      2. Syracuse is a city in central New York state.


      3. MIT is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is in eastern Massachusetts
      near Boston.


      4. Geographically, Massachusetts is east of New York state. The eastern border
      of New York is adjacent to the western borders of Massachusetts and other New
      England states.


      5. Syracuse is in central New York, so it''s even further west than the New
      York-Massachusetts border.


      6. Cambridge/Boston is on the eastern side of Massachusetts, near the Atlantic
      coast.


      7. Therefore, MIT (in eastern Massachusetts) must be east of Syracuse University
      (in central New York).


      8. If MIT is east of Syracuse, then Syracuse is NOT east of MIT.</think>I''ll
      solve this by comparing the geographic locations:


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Syracuse University is located in Syracuse, New York, which is in central
      New York state.

      - Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
      which is in eastern Massachusetts near Boston.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states.

      - Massachusetts is generally east of New York state.

      - Syracuse is in central New York, not even the eastern part of the state.

      - Cambridge/Boston is on the eastern edge of Massachusetts, near the Atlantic
      Ocean.


      Step 3: Compare their longitude positions.

      - Syracuse, NY is further west than Cambridge, MA.

      - Therefore, MIT is east of Syracuse University, not the other way around.


      NO, Syracuse University is not located east of MIT. It is located west of MIT.'

      Let me think about the general geographic positions:

      - Syracuse University is in Syracuse, New York

      - MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) is in Cambridge, Massachusetts
      (near Boston)


      To determine which is further east, I need to compare their approximate longitudes.


      Massachusetts is on the eastern coast of the United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      New York state is west of Massachusetts, though parts of eastern New York are
      at similar longitudes to western Massachusetts.


      Syracuse is located in central New York state, which is definitely west of Massachusetts.

      Cambridge/Boston is on the eastern edge of Massachusetts, on the Atlantic coast.


      So Syracuse, NY would be west of Cambridge, MA.

      - Syracuse is in central New York state

      - New York state is generally west of Massachusetts (though parts of eastern
      NY are adjacent to western MA)


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - Cambridge/Boston is on the eastern edge of Massachusetts, near the Atlantic
      coast

      - Syracuse is in central New York, significantly inland and west of the Massachusetts
      border


      Step 4: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - Syracuse is clearly west of Cambridge, not east of it

      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these cities in the United States.

      - San Francisco is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Boston is on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Moving from west to east across the continental United States, you would encounter

      San Francisco (UCSF) is located east of Boston University (BU), I need to consider
      their geographic locations in the United States.


      Boston University is located in Boston, Massachusetts, which is on the East
      Coast of the United States.


      University of California, San Francisco is located in San Francisco, California,
      which is on the West Coast of the United States.


      In the United States, the East Coast (like Massachusetts) is east of the West
      Coast (like California). This means that California is west of Massachusetts,
      not east of it.


      Therefore, UCSF (in San Francisco, CA) is NOT east of Boston University (in
      Boston, MA). It''s actually west of Boston University.</think>I need to determine
      the relative geographic positions of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) is located in San Francisco,
      California, on the west coast of the United States.

      - Boston University is located in Boston, Massachusetts, on the east coast of
      the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their positions on the map.

      - The United States spans from west (Pacific Ocean) to east (Atlantic Ocean).

      - California is on the western side of the country, while Massachusetts is on
      the eastern side.


      Step 3: Determine relative position.

      - Moving east means going from west to east on a map (from California toward
      Massachusetts).

      - UCSF is west of Boston University, not east of it.


      NO'

      2. Boston University (BU) - This is in Boston, Massachusetts, which is on the
      east coast of the United States.


      In the United States, the west coast (California) is to the west of the east
      coast (Massachusetts). This means San Francisco is west of Boston, not east

      So UCSF is located to the west of Boston University, not to the east.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions

      California

      - Boston University is located in Boston, Massachusetts


      Step 2: Determine their geographic positions within the United States.

      - San Francisco is on the west coast of the United States

      - Boston is on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - When looking at a US map, California is to the west of Massachusetts

      - Moving east means moving from the west coast toward the east coast


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion.

      - Since San Francisco (CA) is on the west coast and Boston (MA) is on the east
      coast, UCSF is located west of Boston University, not east of it.

      6. When we talk about east and west in the US, locations on the east coast (like
      Boston) are considered to be east of locations on the west coast (like San Francisco).


      7. Therefore, San Francisco is west of Boston, not east of it.


      8. Since UCSF is in San Francisco and Boston University is in Boston, UCSF is
      west of Boston University, not east of it.</think>I need to determine the geographic

      - Boston University is located in Boston, Massachusetts


      Step 2: Determine their positions on the US map.

      - San Francisco is on the west coast of the United States, facing the Pacific
      Ocean

      - Boston is on the east coast of the United States, facing the Atlantic Ocean


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - In the United States, locations are generally considered "east" when they
      are closer to the Atlantic Ocean and "west" when they are closer to the Pacific
      Ocean

      - Boston is much further east than San Francisco

      - Therefore, UCSF (in San Francisco) is west of Boston University, not east

      - In terms of U.S. geography, California is west of Massachusetts.

      - San Francisco is on the Pacific coast, while Boston is on the Atlantic coast.

      - Moving from west to east across the continental United States, you would travel
      from California to Massachusetts, not the other way around.

      First, let me identify where each university is located:

      - University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) is located in San Francisco,
      California, which is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Boston University (BU) is located in Boston, Massachusetts, which is on the

      \ locations of both institutions:\n\n1. Cornell University College of Veterinary\
      \ Medicine is located in Ithaca, NY\n2. School of International and Public Affairs,\
      \ Columbia University is located in New York City, NY (specifically in Manhattan)\n\
      \nNow I need to determine which one is further east. In New York state, New\
      \ York City is located in the southeastern part of the state, while Ithaca is\
      \ located more in the central/western part of the state.\n\nNew York City is\
      \ approximately at longitude -74.0060\xB0 W\nIthaca is approximately at longitude\
      \ -76.5000\xB0 W\n\nSince a smaller (less negative) western longitude means\
      \ further east, New York City is east of Ithaca.\n\nTherefore, Cornell University\
      \ College of Veterinary Medicine (in Ithaca) is NOT east of the School of International\
      \ and Public Affairs, Columbia University (in NYC). Rather, it's the opposite\
      \ - Columbia is east of Cornell.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine\
      \ the relative east-west positions of these two institutions.\n\nStep 1: Identify\
      \ the locations of both institutions.\n- Cornell University College of Veterinary\
      \ Medicine is located in Ithaca, NY\n- School of International and Public Affairs,\
      \ Columbia University is located in Manhattan, New York City, NY\n\nStep 2:\
      \ Compare their geographic positions.\n- Ithaca is located in the central/western\
      \ part of New York state\n- New York City is located in the southeastern part\
      \ of New York state\n\nStep 3: Check their longitudes.\n- Ithaca, NY is approximately\
      \ at longitude 76.5\xB0 W\n- New York City is approximately at longitude 74.0\xB0\
      \ W\n- A smaller western longitude number (less negative) indicates a more easterly\
      \ position\n\nStep 4: Make the comparison.\nSince New York City has a smaller\
      \ western longitude than Ithaca, Columbia University is east of Cornell University\
      \ College of Veterinary Medicine, not the other way around.\n\nNO"

      \n1. I need to determine the locations of both institutions:\n   - Cornell University\
      \ College of Veterinary Medicine, NY\n   - School of International and Public\
      \ Affairs, Columbia University, NY\n\n2. The Cornell University College of Veterinary\
      \ Medicine is located in Ithaca, NY.\n\n3. The School of International and Public\
      \ Affairs at Columbia University is located in New York City, NY (Manhattan).\n\
      \n4. Now I need to compare their east-west positions:\n   - Ithaca is in upstate\
      \ New York, west of the Catskill Mountains\n   - New York City is on the eastern\
      \ coast of New York state\n\n5. Specifically:\n   - Ithaca is approximately\
      \ at 76.5\xB0 W longitude\n   - New York City is approximately at 74.0\xB0 W\
      \ longitude\n\n6. Since a smaller western longitude number means further east\

      \ Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nTo determine if Cornell University College of Veterinary\
      \ Medicine is east of Columbia University's School of International and Public\
      \ Affairs, I need to locate both institutions geographically.\n\n1. Cornell\
      \ University College of Veterinary Medicine is located in Ithaca, NY, in the\
      \ central/western part of New York State.\n\n2. Columbia University's School\
      \ of International and Public Affairs is located in Manhattan, New York City,\
      \ which is in the southeastern part of New York State.\n\n3. When comparing\
      \ east-west positions in the United States, we need to look at longitude. Lower\
      \ longitude numbers (going west to east) indicate more eastern locations.\n\n\
      4. Ithaca, NY is approximately at 76.5\xB0 W longitude.\n\n5. New York City\
      \ is approximately at 74.0\xB0 W longitude.\n\n6. Since New York City has a\
      \ lower longitude number than Ithaca, Columbia's School is east of Cornell's\
      \ Veterinary Medicine College, not the other way around.\n\n# Answer: NO"
