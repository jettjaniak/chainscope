      \ question step by step to determine whether the University of California, Los\
      \ Angeles (UCLA) is located east of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison\
      \ College of Engineering.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations of Both Universities\n\
      \nFirst, we need to know where each university is situated.\n\n- **University\
      \ of California, Los Angeles (UCLA):** Located in Los Angeles, California.\n\
      - **University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison College of Engineering:** Located in\
      \ Madison, Wisconsin.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Geographic Positions of\
      \ California and Wisconsin\n\nNext, let's look at the general geographic locations\
      \ of California and Wisconsin within the United States.\n\n- **California:**\
      \ Located on the west coast of the United States.\n- **Wisconsin:** Located\
      \ in the Midwest region of the United States.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Relative\
      \ East-West Positions\n\nTo determine if UCLA is east of the University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Madison, we need to compare their longitudinal positions.\n\n- **Longitude Basics:**\
      \ Longitude measures how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian.\
      \ A higher longitude value indicates a location is further east.\n\n### Step\
      \ 4: Find the Longitude Coordinates\n\nLet's find the approximate longitude\
      \ for both cities.\n\n- **Los Angeles, CA:** Approximately 118.2437\xB0 W\n\
      - **Madison, WI:** Approximately 89.4012\xB0 W\n\n### Step 5: Compare the Longitude\
      \ Values\n\nNow, let's compare these longitude values to see which one is further\
      \ east.\n\n- **Los Angeles:** 118.2437\xB0 W\n- **Madison:** 89.4012\xB0 W\n\
      \nSince the longitude value for Madison is numerically smaller (i.e., less west)\
      \ than that of Los Angeles, Madison is further east compared to Los Angeles.\n\
      \n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\nBased on the longitude comparison:\n\n- **University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013Madison** is east of **UCLA**.\n\nTherefore, the answer\
      \ to the question is:\n\n**NO**, University of California, Los Angeles, CA is\
      \ **not** located east of University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison College of Engineering,\
      \ WI."

      \ question methodically. The goal is to determine whether Northwestern University\
      \ in Illinois is located east of the University of Georgia in Georgia. To do\
      \ this, I'll need to understand the geographical locations of both universities\
      \ and compare their positions relative to each other, specifically in terms\
      \ of east-west orientation.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations of Both Universities\n\
      \n**Northwestern University, IL:**\n- Located in Evanston, Illinois.\n- Illinois\
      \ is in the Midwestern region of the United States.\n- Evanston is a suburb\
      \ just north of Chicago, Illinois.\n\n**University of Georgia, GA:**\n- Located\
      \ in Athens, Georgia.\n- Georgia is in the southeastern region of the United\
      \ States.\n- Athens is northeast of Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n### Step 2: Understand\
      \ the Geographical Coordinates\n\nTo determine which location is east of the\
      \ other, we can look at their longitude values. In geography, longitude measures\
      \ how far east or west a location is from the prime meridian (0\xB0 longitude).\n\
      \n- **Longitude Basics:**\n  - Positive longitude values are east of the prime\
      \ meridian.\n  - Negative longitude values are west of the prime meridian.\n\
      \  - The United States spans from approximately 65\xB0 W to 125\xB0 W longitude.\n\
      \n### Step 3: Find the Longitude of Each University\n\n**Northwestern University,\
      \ IL:**\n- Evanston, Illinois has a longitude of approximately 87.68\xB0 W.\n\
      \n**University of Georgia, GA:**\n- Athens, Georgia has a longitude of approximately\
      \ 83.37\xB0 W.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Longitudes\n\nNow, let's compare these\
      \ two longitude values:\n\n- Evanston, IL: 87.68\xB0 W\n- Athens, GA: 83.37\xB0\
      \ W\n\nIn terms of longitude, a lower numerical value (closer to 0) means a\
      \ location is further east. Therefore:\n\n- Athens, GA (83.37\xB0 W) is east\
      \ of Evanston, IL (87.68\xB0 W).\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nSince Athens,\
      \ Georgia, where the University of Georgia is located, has a lower longitude\
      \ value than Evanston, Illinois, where Northwestern University is situated,\
      \ it means that the University of Georgia is east of Northwestern University.\n\
      \n**Final Answer:** NO, Northwestern University, IL is not located east of University\
      \ of Georgia, GA. Instead, University of Georgia, GA is located east of Northwestern\
      \ University, IL."
