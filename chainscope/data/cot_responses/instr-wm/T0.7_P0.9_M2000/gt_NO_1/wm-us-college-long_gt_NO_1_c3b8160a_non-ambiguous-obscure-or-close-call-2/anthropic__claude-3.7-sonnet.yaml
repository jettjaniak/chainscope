      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Stanford University is located in Stanford, California, which is on the west
      coast of the United States.

      - Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland, which is on the
      east coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions on a map of the United States.

      - California is on the west coast, bordering the Pacific Ocean.

      - Maryland is on the east coast, near the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Going from west to east across the continental United States, you would encounter
      California first, then cross the country to reach Maryland.


      Step 3: Compare their positions in terms of east/west orientation.

      - Since California is on the west coast and Maryland is on the east coast, Stanford
      University is west of Johns Hopkins University.

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - Arizona State University is in Tempe, Arizona (AZ)

      - Harvard Summer School is in Cambridge, Massachusetts (MA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states within the US.

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Massachusetts is on the east coast of the United States

      - Arizona is much further west, closer to the west coast


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Massachusetts is east of Arizona. Therefore, Harvard Summer School (in MA) is
      east of Arizona State University (in AZ), not the other way around.


      NO, Arizona State University is not located east of Harvard Summer School.'

      \ (ASU) in Arizona is located east of Harvard Summer School in Massachusetts,\
      \ I need to compare their relative positions on a map of the United States.\n\
      \nStep 1: Identify the locations.\n- Arizona State University is located in\
      \ Tempe, Arizona (AZ), which is in the southwestern United States.\n- Harvard\
      \ Summer School is in Cambridge, Massachusetts (MA), which is in the northeastern\
      \ United States.\n\nStep 2: Consider their positions relative to each other\
      \ in terms of east-west orientation.\n- States in the eastern United States\
      \ (like Massachusetts) are generally east of states in the southwestern United\
      \ States (like Arizona).\n- Massachusetts is on the East Coast, while Arizona\
      \ is closer to the West Coast.\n\nStep 3: Confirm with geographical knowledge.\n\
      - Massachusetts is approximately at longitude 71\xB0 W\n- Arizona is approximately\
      \ at longitude 111\xB0 W\n- Since a smaller western longitude number means further\
      \ east, Massachusetts is east of Arizona.\n\nStep 4: Draw conclusion about the\
      \ specific institutions.\n- Since Harvard Summer School is in Massachusetts\
      \ and Arizona State University is in Arizona, Harvard Summer School is east\
      \ of Arizona State University.\n- This means Arizona State University is west\
      \ of Harvard Summer School, not east.\n\nNO, Arizona State University is not\
      \ located east of Harvard Summer School."
