      \ out if Stanford University in California is east of Johns Hopkins University\
      \ in Maryland. Hmm. First, I should recall where these two universities are\
      \ located. \n\nStanford University is in California. I know California is on\
      \ the west coast of the United States. So Stanford is definitely in the western\
      \ part of the country. Johns Hopkins is in Maryland, which is on the east coast.\
      \ So Maryland is in the eastern US. \n\nWait, but the question is asking if\
      \ Stanford is east of Johns Hopkins. So if Maryland is on the east coast, and\
      \ California is on the west coast, that would mean Stanford is west of Johns\
      \ Hopkins. But maybe I'm mixing up the directions. Let me confirm the longitude\
      \ coordinates.\n\nLongitude measures east-west position. Places with higher\
      \ longitude (more east) are further east. Wait, no, longitude is measured from\
      \ the prime meridian. The US is west of the prime meridian, so all longitudes\
      \ in the US are west (negative if using the -180 to +180 system). So the lower\
      \ the longitude (more negative), the further west. \n\nLet me check approximate\
      \ longitudes. Stanford is in Palo Alto, CA. I think Palo Alto is around 122\
      \ degrees west longitude. Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, MD, which is around 76\
      \ degrees west longitude. Wait, wait. If Stanford is at 122\xB0W and Johns Hopkins\
      \ is at 76\xB0W, then Stanford is further west because 122 is more west (higher\
      \ in negative terms if we consider west as negative). So since Johns Hopkins\
      \ is at 76\xB0W, that's east of 122\xB0W. Therefore, Stanford is west of Johns\
      \ Hopkins. So the answer would be NO, Stanford isn't east of Johns Hopkins;\
      \ it's west.\n</think>NO. Stanford University in California is located on the\
      \ west coast (approx. 122\xB0W longitude), while Johns Hopkins University in\
      \ Maryland is on the east coast (approx. 76\xB0W longitude). Since lower numerical\
      \ longitude values (west of the Prime Meridian) are further east, Stanford is\
      \ west of Johns Hopkins."

      \ is located. Stanford is in California, which is on the west coast of the US.\
      \ Johns Hopkins is in Maryland, which is on the east coast. But just being on\
      \ the east coast doesn't automatically mean it's east of everything else. Wait,\
      \ California is definitely west, but Maryland is on the eastern side. But maybe\
      \ Stanford is farther east within California? Or maybe the specific cities where\
      \ these universities are located have different longitudes.\n\nLet me think.\
      \ Stanford's main campus is in Stanford, California, which is near Palo Alto,\
      \ part of the San Francisco Bay Area. Johns Hopkins University's main campus\
      \ is in Baltimore, Maryland. So I need to compare the longitude of Stanford,\
      \ CA and Baltimore, MD. \n\nLongitude is measured from the prime meridian, with\

      \ system, but in the US, all longitudes are west, so they would be negative\
      \ numbers. Wait, maybe I should check approximate coordinates.\n\nLet me recall:\
      \ San Francisco is around 122 degrees west longitude. Baltimore is around 76\
      \ degrees west longitude. Wait, but longitude west of the prime meridian increases\
      \ as you go west. So a lower numerical value (like 76) would be more east, and\
      \ higher (like 122) more west. So Stanford, CA (around 122\xB0W) has a higher\
      \ west longitude than Baltimore, MD (around 76\xB0W). Since longitude west increases\
      \ as you go west, Stanford is more west than Baltimore. So Baltimore is east\

      \nSo I should probably look up the approximate longitudes of both universities.\
      \ Longitude measures east-west position. The further east a place is, the higher\

      \ no. Let me clarify. In the US, all longitudes are west of the prime meridian,\
      \ so they're measured as degrees west. So a lower number (like 75\xB0W) would\
      \ be further east than a higher number (like 120\xB0W). So if Stanford has a\
      \ higher longitude (more west), then Johns Hopkins, being in Maryland, would\
      \ have a lower longitude (more east). Therefore, Stanford would be west of Johns\
      \ Hopkins, making Johns Hopkins east of Stanford. So the question is asking\

      \ west.\n\nBut let me confirm the actual longitudes. Stanford University is\
      \ in Stanford, California. Let me recall that San Francisco is around 122\xB0\

      W. Therefore, Stanford is at 122\xB0W, which is west, and Johns Hopkins is at\

      \ Wait, actually, since the US spans from the Atlantic to the Pacific, east\
      \ coast states are generally to the east of west coast states. But I need to\
      \ be more precise.\n\nLet me recall the approximate longitudes. Longitude measures\
      \ east-west position. Places with higher longitude west (or lower if measured\
      \ as negative in the west) are further west. California is in the Pacific Time\
      \ Zone, which is UTC-8, while Maryland is in the Eastern Time Zone, UTC-5. The\
      \ Eastern Time Zone is east of the Central, which is east of Mountain, then\
      \ Pacific. So in terms of longitude, the Eastern states are further east, meaning\
      \ their longitudes are more to the east (lower in terms of negative numbers\
      \ if we're using the western hemisphere). Wait, longitude increases as you go\
      \ east, but west longitudes are negative. So for example, California has a longitude\
      \ around 120\xB0 West, whereas Maryland might be around 75\xB0 West. Wait, no\u2014\
      wait, longitude for the US is west of the prime meridian, so it's measured in\
      \ degrees west, but in terms of decimal, it's negative. So Stanford's longitude\
      \ is approximately -122.16 (for Stanford, CA), and Johns Hopkins in Baltimore,\
      \ MD is around -76.58. Since longitude decreases as you go east (becomes less\

      \ zero. So Stanford is at -122.16, which is further west than Johns Hopkins\
      \ at -76.58. Therefore, Stanford is west of Johns Hopkins, meaning Johns Hopkins\

      \  \n   - Stanford, CA: ~122\xB0 W longitude (more negative).  \n   - Baltimore,\

      \ Positioning:** A location with a less negative (higher numerical value when\
      \ disregarding sign) longitude is farther east. Since 76\xB0 W is east of 122\xB0\
      \ W, Baltimore (Johns Hopkins) is east of Stanford.  \n4. **Conclusion:** Stanford,\

      \ longitudes that are more negative (since they are west of the prime meridian).\
      \ Wait, longitude can be a bit confusing here. Let me think again: the prime\
      \ meridian is 0 degrees, and to the west, the longitude becomes negative (west\

      \ So, the user is asking if the California Institute of Technology (Caltech)\

      \ one is further east.\n\nLet me start by recalling where these two schools\
      \ are. Caltech is in Pasadena, California. The University of Chicago is in Chicago,\
      \ Illinois. Now, I need to compare their longitudes because east and west positions\
      \ are determined by longitude. The further east a location is (higher longitude\
      \ in the eastern hemisphere), the more eastward it is compared to another place\
      \ with a lower longitude.\n\nWait, but longitude can be a bit tricky. The prime\
      \ meridian is 0\xB0, and as you go west from there, the longitude becomes negative\
      \ in the western hemisphere. So, in the United States, which is in the western\
      \ hemisphere, all longitudes are west of the prime meridian, meaning they have\
      \ negative values. So, for example, Chicago is around 87.6\xB0W, which is -87.6\
      \ in decimal degrees. Similarly, Los Angeles (and Pasadena) is around 118.1\xB0\
      W, which is -118.1. \n\nBut when comparing eastness, a location with a less\
      \ negative longitude is further east. So, for example, -87.6 is more east than\
      \ -118.1 because it's closer to 0\xB0. So, Chicago's longitude is -87.6, and\
      \ Pasadena's is -118.1. Since -87.6 is greater (less negative) than -118.1,\
      \ Chicago is further east. Therefore, Caltech in Pasadena is west of the University\

      \ Chicago is in the Midwest, on the shore of Lake Michigan, and California is\

    eb8861b7-4150-44a8-9fb9-98ba9bdb5268: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user wants to know if the California Institute of Technology (Caltech)\
      \ in California is located east of the University of Chicago's college in Illinois.\
      \ Hmm. Okay, first, I need to figure out where both of these schools are located\
      \ geographically.\n\nStarting with Caltech. I know Caltech is in Pasadena, California.\
      \ I remember that Pasadena is near Los Angeles, which is on the west coast of\
      \ the United States. So that would place it in the Pacific Time Zone. Now, the\
      \ University of Chicago is in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago is in the Midwest,\
      \ right? That's in the Central Time Zone. \n\nNow, thinking about the longitude.\
      \ The further east you go, the higher the longitude (in the western hemisphere,\
      \ longitude is measured west from the prime meridian, but when considering east-west\
      \ positions in the US, cities further to the east have more westerly longitudes...\
      \ wait, no, actually, longitude increases as you go west in the western hemisphere.\
      \ Wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me double-check. Longitude lines run north-south,\
      \ and measure east or west of the prime meridian. So, for the US, which is west\
      \ of the prime meridian, the longitude is measured in degrees west. So, a location\
      \ with a higher longitude (more west) would be further to the west. For example,\
      \ Los Angeles is around 118 degrees West, while Chicago is around 87 degrees\
      \ West. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, Chicago is actually around 87 degrees\
      \ West longitude, and Los Angeles is around 118 degrees West. Wait, no. Because\
      \ the prime meridian is 0 degrees, and as you go west from there, the longitude\
      \ increases up to 180. So, Chicago is at approximately 87.6\xB0 W, and Los Angeles\
      \ is about 118.2\xB0 W. Wait, but that would mean Los Angeles is further west\
      \ than Chicago because 118 is higher than 87. So, if Caltech is in Pasadena\
      \ (LA area), which is at a higher west longitude (more west), that would be\
      \ further west than Chicago. Therefore, Chicago is east of Caltech. So, the\
      \ question is asking if Caltech is east of the University of Chicago. If Chicago\
      \ is east of Caltech, then Caltech is west of Chicago. Therefore, the answer\
      \ would be NO, Caltech is not east of the University of Chicago.\n\nWait, let\
      \ me make sure. Let me check the approximate longitudes. The University of Chicago\
      \ is in Chicago, IL. Chicago's coordinates are approximately 41.8\xB0 N latitude,\
      \ 87.6\xB0 W longitude. Pasadena, CA, where Caltech is located, is around 34.1\xB0\
      \ N latitude, 118.1\xB0 W longitude. So, comparing the longitudes: 118.1\xB0\
      \ W (Caltech) vs. 87.6\xB0 W (Chicago). Since longitude west increases as you\
      \ go further west, a higher number means further west. Therefore, 118.1\xB0\
      \ W is more west than 87.6\xB0 W. So, Caltech is west of Chicago. Therefore,\
      \ Caltech is not east of the University of Chicago; it's west. Therefore, the\
      \ answer is NO.\n</think>NO.  \n**Reasoning:**  \n1. **Caltech** is located\

      \ is situated. The University of Virginia (UVA) is in Charlottesville, Virginia.\
      \ Texas A&M is in College Station, Texas. Now, I need to determine the approximate\
      \ longitude of each city because east and west are determined by longitude;\
      \ the further east (higher longitude) a place is, the more eastward it is.\n\
      \nWait, no, longitude is measured from the prime meridian (0\xB0), which goes\
      \ through Greenwich, England. For the United States, which is in the western\
      \ hemisphere, all longitudes are west, so they're negative if we use the convention\
      \ where east longitudes are positive and west are negative. But when comparing\
      \ eastness, a location with a less negative (or more positive) longitude is\
      \ further east. For example, if one city is at -75\xB0 and another at -95\xB0\
      , the one at -75\xB0 is further east because it's closer to the prime meridian.\n\
      \nSo, Charlottesville, VA: I think it's in the eastern part of Virginia. Virginia\
      \ itself is on the East Coast. Let me estimate its longitude. Maybe around 78\xB0\
      \ West? Or perhaps a bit more. For example, Richmond, VA is about 77.5\xB0 W.\
      \ Charlottesville is west of Richmond, so maybe around 78.5\xB0 W longitude.\n\
      \nTexas A&M in College Station, TX. Texas is a big state, stretching from around\
      \ 93\xB0 W to 106\xB0 W. College Station is in eastern Texas, maybe. Let me\
      \ think. Houston is around 95\xB0 W. College Station is northwest.3.3.3\xB0\
      \ W? Let me check approximate coordinates. \n\nWait, maybe I should recall that\
      \ Austin is around 97.7\xB0 W. College Station is northeast of Austin, so perhaps\
      \ a bit less. Maybe 96.3\xB0 W as I thought. \n\nSo Charlottesville is around\
      \ 78.5\xB0 W, College Station around 96.3\xB0 W. Since longitude west is negative\
      \ when using decimal degrees (i.e., -78.5 and -96.3). The more negative the\
      \ longitude, the further west. So -78.5 is east of -96.3. Therefore, Charlottesville\
      \ is east of College Station. Therefore, Texas A&M (College Station) is west\
      \ of UVA (Charlottesville). So the question is: Is Texas A&M east of UVA? The\
      \ answer would be NO. Because College Station is west of Charlottesville. \n\
      \nWait, but maybe I got the longitudes wrong. Let me verify approximate coordinates.\

      \ Charlottesville's coordinates are approximately 38.0293\xB0 N, 78.4767\xB0\

      \ are approximately 30.6280\xB0 N, 96.3344\xB0 W. So longitude is 96.33\xB0\
      \ W. \n\nComparing 78.48\xB0 W vs. 96.33\xB0 W. Since both are west longitude,\
      \ the one with the smaller longitude number (closer to 0\xB0) is further east.\
      \ So 78.48\xB0 W is east of 96.33\xB0 W. Therefore, College Station is west\

      \ the western hemisphere. Wait, maybe I should clarify.\n\nLongitude for locations\

      . So lower numerical values (closer to zero) are more east, higher negative\
      \ numbers are more west.\n\nSo, if College Station, TX has a longitude that's\
      \ more west (a more negative number) than Charlottesville, VA, then Texas A&M\
      \ would be west of UVA. Conversely, if College Station's longitude is less negative\

      \ no, maybe a bit more. For example, Richmond, VA is about 77.5\xB0 W. Charlottesville\
      \ is west of Richmond, so maybe around 78.5\xB0 W? \n\nCollege Station, TX:\
      \ Texas is a big state. College Station is in eastern Texas, but Texas spans\
      \ from around 93\xB0 W to 106\xB0 W. College Station is near Houston, which\
      \ is around 95\xB0 W. So College Station might be around 96\xB0 W. \n\nWait,\
      \ if Charlottesville is around 78.5\xB0 W and College Station is 96\xB0 W, then\
      \ College Station would be west of Charlottesville because higher longitude\
      \ west means further west. But wait, no\u2014longitude is measured from the\
      \ prime meridian (0\xB0), so the further west you go in the Americas, the higher\
      \ the longitude value (in the western hemisphere). So a higher west longitude\
      \ means further west. So if Texas A&M is at 96\xB0 W and UVA is at 78\xB0 W,\
      \ then Texas A&M is west of UVA, meaning UVA is east of Texas A&M. Therefore,\
      \ Texas A&M is west of UVA, so the answer would be NO, it's not east; it's west.\n\
      \nWait, but maybe I got the longitudes wrong. Let me check approximate coordinates.\

      \ step by step. So, the question is whether Texas A&M University in Texas is\
      \ located east of the University of Virginia in Virginia. Hmm, okay. First,\
      \ I need to figure out where each university is located geographically.\n\n\
      Starting with Texas A&M. I know that Texas is a big state in the southern part\
      \ of the US, and Texas A&M's main campus is in College Station, Texas. Now,\
      \ where exactly is College Station? I think it's in the eastern part of Texas,\
      \ but not too close to the eastern border. Maybe central-east? Let me recall...\
      \ Texas is divided into regions, and College Station is near Houston, which\
      \ is in the southeast. Wait, Houston is a major city on the Gulf Coast. So College\
      \ Station is northwest of Houston. That would place it in the southeastern quadrant\
      \ of Texas, but not right on the coast.\n\nNow, the University of Virginia is\
      \ in Charlottesville, Virginia. Virginia is on the East Coast, so Charlottesville\
      \ must be somewhere in that state. Virginia is a mid-Atlantic state, bordering\
      \ the Atlantic Ocean. Charlottesville is in the central part of Virginia, maybe\
      \ a bit west of the coast. For example, Richmond is the capital, and it's east\
      \ of Charlottesville. So Charlottesville is more inland, but still part of the\
      \ eastern US.\n\nNext, I need to compare their longitudes. The key here is longitude\
      \ because east-west positioning is determined by how far east or west a location\
      \ is. The further east a place is (i.e., the higher the longitude in the western\
      \ hemisphere, since west longitudes are negative), the more eastward it is.\
      \ Wait, no, actually, in the US, all longitudes are west of the prime meridian,\
      \ so they are negative numbers. So a location with a smaller negative longitude\
      \ (closer to zero) is more east. For example, Virginia would have a longitude\
      \ that's less negative (more east) than Texas, which is further west.\n\nLet\
      \ me check approximate longitudes. College Station, TX: I believe it's around\
      \ 96.3\xB0W. Charlottesville, VA is approximately 78.5\xB0W. Since 78.5\xB0\
      W is less than 96.3\xB0W (both are negative, so -78.5 is actually higher than\
      \ -96.3), that means Charlottesville is further east. Therefore, Texas A&M (College\
      \ Station) is west of the University of Virginia (Charlottesville). So the answer\

      \ Texas A&M is in College Station, Texas. Now, I need to compare their geographical\

      \ are determined by longitude. The further east a location is (higher longitude\
      \ in the western hemisphere), the more eastward it is.\n\nWait, no, actually,\
      \ longitude lines run north-south, but they measure east or west of the prime\
      \ meridian. So places with a higher longitude (more positive) in the western\
      \ hemisphere are further west because longitude increases as you go west from\
      \ the prime meridian up to 180 degrees. Wait, no\u2014longitude is measured\
      \ from 0\xB0 at the prime meridian (Greenwich, UK) going east to 180\xB0E and\
      \ west to 180\xB0W, but in reality, it's often represented as 0\xB0 to 180\xB0\
      \ East and West. So, in the United States, which is west of the prime meridian,\
      \ all longitudes are west, so they are measured as degrees west, which would\
      \ be negative if using the standard coordinate system where east is positive.\
      \ For example, New York City is around 74\xB0W, which would be -74 degrees in\
      \ decimal terms. \n\nSo, the more negative the longitude, the further west the\

      \ case, then Charlottesville is at around -78.5\xB0, and College Station is\
      \ at -96.34\xB0. Since -78.5 is greater than -96.34 (because it's less negative),\
      \ that means Charlottesville is further east. Therefore, College Station (Texas\

      \ but Boston is on the east coast, right? Like, it's a coastal city in Massachusetts.\
      \ Philadelphia is also a coastal city but further south. But east and west directions\
      \ can be a bit tricky here. Let me think about their longitudes. The key here\
      \ is to compare their longitudinal coordinates because longitude determines\
      \ east-west positioning.\n\nI recall that Boston is around 71 degrees west longitude.\
      \ Let me verify: Boston, MA's longitude is approximately 71.0589\xB0 W. And\
      \ Philadelphia, PA is around 75.1652\xB0 W. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\
      \ If Boston is at 71\xB0W and Philadelphia is at 75\xB0W, that would mean Philadelphia\
      \ is further west because the higher the longitude in the west, the further\
      \ west you are. Wait, longitude values increase as you go west in the Western\
      \ Hemisphere. So, a higher degree west means a more westerly location. \n\n\
      So, Boston at ~71\xB0W and Philadelphia at ~75\xB0W. Since 75 is greater than\
      \ 71, Philadelphia is west of Boston. Therefore, Northeastern University (Boston)\
      \ is east of UPenn (Philadelphia). Wait, but the question is asking if UPenn\
      \ is east of Northeastern. So if Boston is at 71\xB0W and Philly at 75\xB0W,\
      \ that means Philly is west of Boston, so UPenn is west of Northeastern. Therefore,\
      \ the answer would be NO, UPenn is not east of Northeastern; it's actually west\
      \ of it.\n\nBut let me double-check those longitude numbers to be sure. Sometimes\
      \ I might mix up the exact coordinates. Let's look up the exact coordinates.\
      \ \n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania's coordinates: Latitude: 39.9522\xB0 N, Longitude:\
      \ 75.1932\xB0 W. \n\nNortheastern University's coordinates: Latitude: 42.3398\xB0\
      \ N, Longitude: 71.0892\xB0 W. \n\nYes, so UPenn's longitude is 75.1932\xB0\
      \ W, and Northeastern's is 71.0892\xB0 W. Since longitude for UPenn is a higher\
      \ number (more west), that means UPenn is west of Northeastern. Therefore, UPenn\
      \ is not east of Northeastern. So the answer is NO.\n</think>NO  \nThe University\
      \ of Pennsylvania (UPenn) in Philadelphia, PA, has a longitude of ~75.19\xB0\
      \ W, while Northeastern University in Boston, MA, is at ~71.09\xB0 W. Since\
      \ lower longitude values (e.g., 71\xB0 W) are farther east than higher ones\
      \ (e.g., 75\xB0 W) in the Western Hemisphere, UPenn is west of Northeastern.\
      \ Thus, UPenn is **not** east of Northeastern."

      The University of Pennsylvania, often called UPenn, is in Philadelphia, PA.\
      \ Northeastern University is in Boston, MA. Now, I need to compare their geographical\
      \ positions, specifically their longitude since east-west direction is determined\
      \ by longitude.\n\nI remember that Philadelphia is south of New York City, and\
      \ Boston is north of NYC. But longitude-wise, which one is further east? Boston\
      \ is on the east coast of Massachusetts, right? Like, it's a coastal city. Philadelphia\

      \ the two: UPenn's longitude is 75.16\xB0 W, while Northeastern's is 71.06\xB0\
      \ W. Since 71.06 is less than 75.16, that means Boston (Northeastern) is east\

      \ The Prime Meridian is 0 degrees, and longitude increases as you go east or\
      \ west from there. But in the US, all longitudes are west of the Prime Meridian,\

      \ North Carolina, which is south of Virginia. So, Tennessee is southwest of\
      \ Virginia? Or maybe more directly west? \n\nWait, Virginia's western border\
      \ is with Kentucky and West Virginia. Tennessee is south of Kentucky. So, if\
      \ Virginia Tech is in Blacksburg, which is in southwestern Virginia near the\
      \ border with Tennessee, then Vanderbilt in Nashville, TN, would be to the west\
      \ of Blacksburg. But the question is about east. So, if Vanderbilt is west of\
      \ Virginia Tech, then the answer would be NO, it's not east. \n\nBut maybe I\

      \ County. The coordinates are approximately 37.2296\xB0 N, 80.4139\xB0 W. Nashville,\
      \ TN is at 36.1627\xB0 N, 86.7816\xB0 W. \n\nLongitude-wise, the more west the\
      \ coordinate (higher W number), the further west it is. So, Nashville's longitude\
      \ is 86.78W, and Blacksburg is 80.41W. Since 86.78 is a larger number than 80.41,\
      \ that means Nashville is further west. Therefore, Vanderbilt is west of Virginia\
      \ Tech. So, the answer would be NO, Vanderbilt is not east of Virginia Tech.\n\
      \nWait, but maybe I got the longitude direction wrong. Let me confirm. The prime\
      \ meridian is 0\xB0, and as you go west from there, the longitude increases\

      \ So, the user is asking if Vanderbilt University in Tennessee is located east\
      \ of Virginia Tech in Virginia. Hmm, okay, first I need to figure out where\
      \ exactly these two schools are located geographically.\n\nLet me start with\
      \ Vanderbilt University. I know it's in Tennessee, but where in Tennessee? Tennessee\
      \ is a state that's sort of in the southeastern part of the US. From what I\
      \ recall, Nashville is the capital of Tennessee, and Vanderbilt is in Nashville.\
      \ Now, where is Nashville located within the state? I think it's in the north-central\
      \ part of Tennessee, maybe around the middle. So that's Vanderbilt's location.\n\
      \nNext, Virginia Tech. Virginia Tech is a university in Virginia. The full name\
      \ is Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, right? And its main\
      \ campus is in Blacksburg, Virginia. Now, where is Blacksburg located within\
      \ Virginia? Virginia is on the east coast, but it's a bit elongated. Blacksburg,\
      \ if I remember correctly, is in the western part of Virginia, in the Appalachian\
      \ Mountains region. So, southwest Virginia, maybe near the border with West\
      \ Virginia.\n\nNow, the question is whether Vanderbilt (TN) is east of Virginia\
      \ Tech (VA). So, I need to compare their longitudinal positions. Longitude measures\
      \ east-west position. If a place has a higher longitude (more east) if we're\
      \ using the conventional system where east longitude is positive, but wait,\
      \ in the US, all longitudes are west, so they're negative in decimal degrees.\
      \ Wait, maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, just think in terms of relative\
      \ positions: which is further east?\n\nSo, if Virginia Tech is in western Virginia,\
      \ and Vanderbilt is in central Tennessee, which is to the west of Virginia.\
      \ But wait, Tennessee is to the west of Virginia as a state. But Vanderbilt\
      \ is in central Tennessee, while Virginia Tech is in western Virginia. So, would\
      \ central Tennessee be west of western Virginia? Let me visualize the map.\n\
      \nVirginia is east of Tennessee. So the eastern border of Tennessee is with\
      \ North Carolina, and Virginia is northeast of Tennessee. So, moving from Tennessee\
      \ eastward, you hit North Carolina and Virginia. But Virginia Tech is in the\
      \ western part of Virginia, closer to the Tennessee border? Wait, no, because\
      \ between Tennessee and Virginia, there's a small part where they share a border.\
      \ Let me check that. Tennessee's northeastern tip borders Virginia. So, if Virginia\
      \ Tech is in Blacksburg, which is in southwestern Virginia, then how does that\
      \ compare to Nashville, TN?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of\
      \ the approximate longitude. Let's see. Blacksburg, VA's longitude is about\
      \ -80.4 degrees. Nashville, TN's longitude is about -86.8 degrees. Wait, longitude\
      \ more negative means further west. So, if Virginia Tech is at -80.4 and Vanderbilt\
      \ is at -86.8, then Vanderbilt is further west, meaning Virginia Tech is further\
      \ east. Therefore, Vanderbilt is west of Virginia Tech. So the question is,\
      \ is Vanderbilt east of Virginia Tech? If Vanderbilt is west, then the answer\
      \ is NO.\n\nWait, but let me confirm those longitude numbers. Let me recall:\
      \ The prime meridian is 0, and moving west, the longitude becomes negative in\
      \ the western hemisphere. So, a lower (more negative) longitude is further west.\
      \ So, if Blacksburg, VA is at around -80.4, and Nashville, TN is at -86.8, then\
      \ Nashville is more west. Therefore, Vanderbilt (Nashville) is west of Virginia\
      \ Tech (Blacksburg). Therefore, the answer would be NO, Vanderbilt is not east\
      \ of Virginia Tech; it's west.\n\nBut wait, maybe I got the longitudes mixed\
      \ up. Let me verify. Looking it up in my mind: For example, the approximate\
      \ longitude of Nashville, TN is indeed around 86 degrees west, which is -86.7.\
      \ Blacksburg, VA is at about 80.4 degrees west (-80.4). Since -86.7 is more\
      \ negative than -80.4, Nashville is west of Blacksburg. Therefore, Vanderbilt\
      \ University in Nashville is west of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. Therefore,\
      \ the answer is NO.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user thinks in terms of state\
      \ positions. Virginia is to the east of Tennessee as a whole. But the specific\
      \ locations might vary. For example, eastern Tennessee is closer to the Virginia\
      \ border, but Nashville is in central Tennessee. However, even so, the longitude\
      \ of Nashville would still be west of Blacksburg.\n\nYes, I think the conclusion\

    fcf68b02-66c1-4e01-a610-14956c392d63: "<think>Okay, let's figure this out. The\
      \ question is whether Vanderbilt University in Tennessee is east of Virginia\
      \ Tech in Virginia. Hmm, first I need to know where each of these schools is\
      \ located. \n\nVanderbilt University is in Nashville, Tennessee. Virginia Tech\
      \ is in Blacksburg, Virginia. So the question is essentially asking if Nashville,\
      \ TN is east of Blacksburg, VA. \n\nNow, I need to recall the geography of these\
      \ states. Virginia is on the East Coast of the US, and Tennessee is to the west\
      \ of Virginia. But wait, let me double-check the relative positions. The state\
      \ of Virginia is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, North Carolina\
      \ and Tennessee to the south, Kentucky to the west, and Maryland/West Virginia\
      \ to the north. So Tennessee is southwest of Virginia. \n\nBlacksburg is in\
      \ southwestern Virginia, near the border with Tennessee. Nashville, on the other\
      \ hand, is in central Tennessee, maybe a bit towards the northern part of the\
      \ state. If I imagine a map, Virginia is to the east of Tennessee. So moving\
      \ from Tennessee (where Vanderbilt is) to Virginia (where Virginia Tech is),\
      \ you'd be going east. Therefore, Blacksburg, VA, being in the western part\
      \ of Virginia, is actually east of Nashville, TN. Wait, but since Tennessee\
      \ is west of Virginia, any point in Virginia should be east of any point in\
      \ Tennessee. Is that accurate?\n\nWait, no. States can have varying longitudes.\
      \ For example, the westernmost part of Virginia might be further west than the\
      \ easternmost part of Tennessee. Wait, but Tennessee is directly west of Virginia.\
      \ Let me confirm the longitude coordinates. \n\nNashville, TN is approximately\
      \ 36.1627\xB0 N, 86.7816\xB0 W. Blacksburg, VA is approximately 37.2296\xB0\
      \ N, 80.4139\xB0 W. \n\nLongitude: the more west the coordinate (more negative\
      \ in the US), the further west it is. So Nashville is at 86.78 W, Blacksburg\
      \ at 80.41 W. Since 80.41 is less than 86.78, that means Blacksburg is east\
      \ of Nashville. Because lower longitude (closer to zero) means further east.\
      \ So yes, Blacksburg is east of Nashville. Therefore, Vanderbilt University\
      \ in Nashville is west of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. So the original question\
      \ is: Is Vanderbilt east of Virginia Tech? The answer would be NO. Because Vanderbilt\
      \ is west, so Virginia Tech is east of Vanderbilt. Therefore, Vanderbilt is\
      \ not east of Virginia Tech.\n</think>NO  \nVanderbilt University (Nashville,\
      \ TN) is located at approximately 86.78\xB0 W longitude, while Virginia Tech\
      \ (Blacksburg, VA) is at 80.41\xB0 W. Since lower longitude values are farther\
      \ east, Blacksburg is east of Nashville. Thus, Vanderbilt is **west** of Virginia\
      \ Tech, not east."

      \ step by step. The user is asking if the University of Phoenix in Arizona is\
      \ located east of Florida State University in Florida. Hmm, that seems a bit\
      \ tricky at first glance because both states are in the southern part of the\
      \ US, but their positions relative to each other might not be immediately obvious.\n\
      \nFirst, I need to confirm where each university is located. The University\
      \ of Phoenix is in Arizona, and Florida State University is in Florida. Now,\
      \ I know that Arizona is in the southwestern part of the United States, while\
      \ Florida is in the southeastern part. But where exactly are the universities\
      \ situated within these states?\n\nFor Florida State University (FSU), I recall\
      \ that it's in Tallahassee, the capital city of Florida. Let me double-check\
      \ that. Yes, FSU's main campus is indeed in Tallahassee, which is in the northern\
      \ part of Florida, close to the Georgia border. Now, the University of Phoenix\
      \ has multiple campuses, but the question specifies the one in Arizona. The\
      \ main campus or headquarters for the University of Phoenix is in Phoenix, Arizona.\
      \ So, Phoenix, AZ, is the location here.\n\nNext, I need to determine the longitudinal\
      \ positions of Phoenix, AZ, and Tallahassee, FL. Longitude measures how far\
      \ east or west a location is. The higher the longitude (in the western hemisphere),\
      \ the further west it is. So, if Phoenix has a higher longitude (more west)\
      \ than Tallahassee, then Phoenix would be west of Tallahassee, meaning Tallahassee\
      \ is east of Phoenix. Conversely, if Tallahassee's longitude is lower (more\
      \ east), then Phoenix is west of Tallahassee.\n\nLet me look up the approximate\
      \ longitudes. Phoenix, AZ is around 112 degrees West. Tallahassee, FL is approximately\
      \ 84 degrees West. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, I might be mixing up\
      \ the numbers. Let me verify. Actually, Phoenix, AZ is at about 112\xB0W longitude,\
      \ while Tallahassee, FL is around 84\xB0W. Because longitude decreases as you\
      \ move east. For example, New York is around 74\xB0W, so Tallahassee being at\
      \ 84\xB0W makes sense as it's further west than New York but still in the Eastern\
      \ Time Zone. Phoenix is in the Mountain Time Zone, which is UTC-7, so its longitude\
      \ would be around 112\xB0W. \n\nSo comparing 112\xB0W (Phoenix) and 84\xB0W\
      \ (Tallahassee), since 84 is a smaller number (more east), Tallahassee is east\
      \ of Phoenix. Therefore, Phoenix is west of Tallahassee. The question is asking\
      \ if University of Phoenix, AZ is east of Florida State University, FL. Since\
      \ Phoenix is west of Tallahassee, that means FSU is east of Phoenix. Therefore,\

      \ Arizona is in the southwestern part of the United States, while Florida is\

      \ think about the states they're in. Arizona is west of Texas, right? And Florida\
      \ is the southeasternmost state, sticking out into the Atlantic and the Gulf\

      \ Florida State University is in Tallahassee, Florida. Now I should find the\
      \ longitude coordinates of both cities because longitude determines east-west\
      \ positioning. \n\nPhoenix, AZ: Let me recall, the approximate longitude. The\
      \ United States spans from about -124 to -67 degrees longitude. The further\
      \ west, the higher the negative number. Phoenix is in the Mountain Time Zone,\
      \ which is UTC-7. But that's time zones, which can be a rough guide. More accurately,\
      \ Phoenix is around 112 degrees west longitude. \n\nTallahassee, FL: Florida\

      \ the University of Phoenix in Arizona is east of Florida State University in\

      \ these universities is. \n\nStarting with the University of Phoenix. I know\
      \ that University of Phoenix is a for-profit university, and I believe its main\
      \ campus is in Phoenix, Arizona. Arizona is a state in the southwestern United\
      \ States. Now, Florida State University is in Florida, which is the southeastern\
      \ state, right? The question is whether Phoenix, AZ is east of Tallahassee,\
      \ FL (since that's where FSU is located). \n\nWait, but states can be quite\
      \ large. Let me confirm the exact locations. Phoenix, AZ is in the central part\
      \ of Arizona. Florida State University is located in Tallahassee, which is in\
      \ the northern part of Florida, near the panhandle.\n\nNow, to determine if\
      \ Phoenix is east of Tallahassee, I need to compare their longitudes. Places\
      \ further east have higher longitude values if we're using the standard coordinate\
      \ system where longitude increases as you go east. Both are in the Northern\
      \ Hemisphere, so latitude isn't the issue here. \n\nLet me recall the approximate\
      \ longitudes. Phoenix, AZ: I think its longitude is around 112 degrees west.\
      \ Wait, actually, Phoenix is in the Mountain Time Zone, which is UTC-7, but\
      \ maybe that's not the most precise way. Let me think. The prime meridian is\
      \ 0 degrees, and going west into the Americas, the longitudes are negative when\
      \ expressed in decimal degrees (like -112\xB0 W). For example, Los Angeles is\
      \ around -118\xB0, and Denver is about -105\xB0. Phoenix is between LA and Denver,\
      \ maybe around -112\xB0W. \n\nTallahassee, FL is in the Eastern Time Zone, which\
      \ is UTC-5. Its longitude should be around -84\xB0W. Let me check that. For\
      \ example, Atlanta, GA is around -84.38\xB0, so Tallahassee, being in the Florida\
      \ panhandle, which is west of most of Florida, might be similar. Let me confirm:\
      \ Tallahassee's coordinates are approximately 30.45\xB0 N latitude, -84.28\xB0\
      \ W longitude. Phoenix, AZ is approximately 33.45\xB0 N, -112.07\xB0 W. \n\n\
      So Phoenix's longitude is -112.07\xB0, and Tallahassee's is -84.28\xB0. Since\
      \ longitude becomes more negative as you go west, a lower (more negative) longitude\
      \ means further west. Therefore, Phoenix (-112.07\xB0) is west of Tallahassee\
      \ (-84.28\xB0). Therefore, Tallahassee is east of Phoenix, which means Phoenix\
      \ is west of Tallahassee. So the question is asking if University of Phoenix,\
      \ AZ is east of Florida State University, FL. Since Phoenix is west of Tallahassee,\
      \ the answer would be NO. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me\
      \ visualize a map of the US. Arizona is to the west of Texas, and Florida is\
      \ on the southeast coast. The Florida panhandle is the part that's closest to\
      \ the central time zone. So, Tallahassee is in the panhandle, which is the northwestern\
      \ part of Florida. But even though it's in the panhandle, it's still east of\
      \ Arizona. So Arizona is definitely further west. Therefore, University of Phoenix\

      \ Now, I need to check the longitude of both cities because east and west directions\
      \ are determined by longitude. Places with a higher longitude (more to the east)\
      \ are further east.\n\nWait, but longitude can be a bit confusing. The prime\
      \ meridian is 0\xB0, and longitude increases going east or west up to 180\xB0\
      . However, in the United States, all longitudes are west of the prime meridian,\
      \ so they are measured as west longitude. That means a lower numerical value\

      W (approximately 112.07\xB0W). Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, Arizona\

      \ confirm.\n\nWait, maybe I mixed up the numbers. Let me think again. The approximate\
      \ longitude for Tallahassee, FL: I think it's around 84 degrees west. For Phoenix,\
      \ AZ, it's about 112 degrees west. If that's the case, then Phoenix is at 112\xB0\
      W, which is further west than Tallahassee's 84\xB0W. Therefore, Tallahassee\

      \ of Florida State University (Tallahassee, FL). Therefore, the answer would\
      \ be NO, University of Phoenix is not east of FSU; it's west.\n\nWait, but maybe\
      \ I got the longitudes wrong. Let me double-check. For example, New York City\

      \ Los Angeles is around 118\xB0W. So Tallahassee in Florida is in the same general\

      \ asking if the University of Phoenix in Arizona is located east of Florida\
      \ State University in Florida. Hmm, I need to figure out the locations of both\
      \ universities and their longitudes to determine which one is further east.\n\
      \nFirst, I know Florida State University is in Florida, which is on the east\
      \ coast of the US. The University of Phoenix is in Arizona, which is in the\
      \ southwest. But I should get the exact cities or coordinates to be sure.\n\n\
      Florida State University's main campus is in Tallahassee, Florida. Let me recall\
      \ where Tallahassee is. Tallahassee is in the northern part of Florida, near\
      \ the border with Georgia. Now, the University of Phoenix has several campuses,\
      \ but the main one or the headquarters might be in Phoenix, Arizona. So I need\
      \ the longitude of Phoenix, AZ, and Tallahassee, FL.\n\nLongitude measures east-west\
      \ position. The further east (higher longitude in the western hemisphere would\
      \ be more west... Wait, no. Longitude in the western hemisphere is measured\
      \ west of the prime meridian. So a higher longitude value (more west) would\
      \ mean a location is further west. So if Phoenix has a higher longitude (more\
      \ west) than Tallahassee, then Phoenix is west of Tallahassee, so Tallahassee\
      \ is east of Phoenix. Wait, let me get this straight. \n\nWait, the Prime Meridian\
      \ is 0 degrees, and as you go west, the longitude increases up to 180 degrees.\
      \ So, for example, New York is around 74 degrees west, and Los Angeles is around\
      \ 118 degrees west. So Los Angeles is further west, higher longitude (in the\
      \ west). So if Phoenix's longitude is higher (more west) than Tallahassee's,\
      \ then Phoenix is west of Tallahassee, meaning Tallahassee is east of Phoenix.\
      \ Therefore, Florida State University (Tallahassee) is east of University of\
      \ Phoenix (Phoenix). Therefore, the answer would be NO, University of Phoenix\
      \ is not east of Florida State; instead, FSU is east of UoP.\n\nLet me confirm\
      \ the longitude coordinates. \n\nLooking up Tallahassee, FL: according to my\
      \ knowledge, the coordinates are approximately 84.28\xB0 W longitude. For Phoenix,\
      \ AZ: approximately 112.07\xB0 W. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if\
      \ Phoenix is at 112\xB0W, which is much further west than Tallahassee's 84\xB0\
      W. So Phoenix is further west. Therefore, Tallahassee is east of Phoenix. Therefore,\
      \ the University of Phoenix (in Phoenix) is west of Florida State U (in Tallahassee).\
      \ So the original question: Is UoP AZ east of FSU FL? Answer is NO. Because\
      \ Phoenix is west of Tallahassee.\n\nWait, but maybe the main campus of University\
      \ of Phoenix isn't in Phoenix? Let me check that. The University of Phoenix\
      \ was founded in Phoenix and is headquartered there, so the main location is\
      \ Phoenix, AZ. So coordinates are correct. So the answer is NO.\n</think>To\
      \ determine if the University of Phoenix (AZ) is east of Florida State University\
      \ (FL):  \n1. **Locations**:  \n   - Florida State University is in **Tallahassee,\
      \ FL** (coordinates \u2248 30.44\xB0 N, 84.28\xB0 W).  \n   - University of\
      \ Phoenix is headquartered in **Phoenix, AZ** (coordinates \u2248 33.45\xB0\
      \ N, 112.07\xB0 W).  \n\n2. **Longitude Comparison**:  \n   - **Tallahassee**:\
      \ ~84.28\xB0 W (eastern US).  \n   - **Phoenix**: ~112.07\xB0 W (western US).\
      \  \n\nSince **Phoenix has a higher west longitude** (112.07\xB0 W > 84.28\xB0\
      \ W), it is **farther west** than Tallahassee. Thus, **Tallahassee (FSU) is\
      \ east of Phoenix (UoP)**.  \n\n**ANSWER: NO**"
    d85e2a35-3451-42cc-afa6-213978ce3ec0: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. So, the user is asking if the University of Phoenix in Arizona\
      \ is located east of Florida State University in Florida. Hmm, at first glance,\
      \ that seems a bit counterintuitive because Arizona is in the western part of\
      \ the US, while Florida is in the southeast. But maybe there's a detail I'm\
      \ missing here.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the locations of both universities.\
      \ Let's start with the University of Phoenix. Wait, the University of Phoenix\
      \ is a for-profit institution that's primarily online, right? But they do have\
      \ physical campuses. The main administrative office or their primary campus\
      \ is in Phoenix, Arizona. So, Phoenix, AZ is the city and state for that university.\n\
      \nNext, Florida State University is located in Tallahassee, Florida. Tallahassee\
      \ is the capital of Florida, situated in the northern part of the state, closer\
      \ to the Georgia border. So, geographically, Tallahassee is in the Florida Panhandle\
      \ region.\n\nNow, to determine if Phoenix, AZ is east of Tallahassee, FL. Let\
      \ me recall the approximate longitudes of these cities. Longitude measures east-west\
      \ position. The lower the longitude (in the western hemisphere where the US\
      \ is), the further east a location is. \n\nPhoenix, AZ has a longitude of around\
      \ 112 degrees West. Tallahassee, FL is at about 84 degrees West. Since 84 degrees\
      \ West is a smaller number than 112 degrees West, Tallahassee is actually further\
      \ east than Phoenix. Wait, that means Phoenix is west of Tallahassee. So, if\
      \ Tallahassee is in Florida, which is on the East Coast, and Phoenix is in Arizona,\
      \ which is in the Southwest, then Phoenix is definitely west of Florida State\
      \ University. Therefore, the University of Phoenix in AZ would be west of Florida\
      \ State, not east. \n\nSo the answer should be NO. The University of Phoenix\
      \ is not east of Florida State University; it's actually west of it. Let me\
      \ just double-check the longitudes to be sure. A quick mental check: the prime\
      \ meridian is 0 degrees, and as you go west in the US, the longitude increases\
      \ (e.g., New York is around 74W, Chicago 87W, Denver 105W, LA 118W). Phoenix\
      \ at 112W is west of Tallahassee at 84W. So yes, Phoenix is west, making the\
      \ answer NO.\n</think>NO  \nThe University of Phoenix is located in Phoenix,\
      \ Arizona, which has a longitude of approximately 112\xB0W. Florida State University\
      \ is in Tallahassee, Florida, at around 84\xB0W. Since lower longitude values\
      \ (closer to 0\xB0) indicate a more easterly position in the western hemisphere,\
      \ Tallahassee lies significantly farther east than Phoenix. Therefore, the University\
      \ of Phoenix is west of Florida State University."
    e4282b92-661d-4a63-be7d-fa3394f8e5b1: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the University of Phoenix in Arizona is located east of Florida State\
      \ University in Florida. Hmm, first, I need to figure out where each of these\
      \ universities is located geographically. \n\nSo, starting with the University\
      \ of Phoenix. I know it's a for-profit university based in Arizona. But wait,\
      \ Arizona is a state in the southwestern United States. The main campus, I think,\
      \ is in Phoenix, the capital city of Arizona. But I should confirm that. Then\
      \ Florida State University is in Florida, which is in the southeastern part\
      \ of the US. The main campus of Florida State is in Tallahassee, the state capital\
      \ of Florida.\n\nNext, I need to compare their longitudes. Because east and\
      \ west directions are determined by longitude. The place with the higher longitude\
      \ is farther east. Wait, no, actually, longitude increases as you go east from\
      \ the prime meridian. So, if one location has a higher longitude than another,\
      \ it is more to the east. But the US is in the western hemisphere, so all longitudes\
      \ are west (negative if we consider the prime meridian as 0). So, Arizona and\
      \ Florida are both in the western hemisphere, so their longitudes are west.\
      \ So, a lower numerical value (less negative) would mean more east. For example,\
      \ if Phoenix is at, say, 112\xB0W and Tallahassee is at 84\xB0W, then Tallahassee\
      \ is east of Phoenix. Wait, but longitude west: higher numbers as you go west.\
      \ So, Phoenix is further west than Tallahassee. Therefore, Tallahassee would\
      \ be east of Phoenix. So in that case, the University of Phoenix (Arizona) would\
      \ be west of Florida State University (Florida). Therefore, the answer would\
      \ be NO, because University of Phoenix is west of FSU. \n\nBut let me check\
      \ the actual coordinates to be sure. Maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think. Phoenix,\
      \ Arizona: I recall that Phoenix is at approximately 33\xB0N latitude and 112\xB0\
      W longitude. Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. A quick mental check: Arizona\
      \ is in the Mountain Time Zone (though parts of it don't observe daylight saving\
      \ time). Florida is in the Eastern Time Zone. The Eastern Time Zone is UTC-5,\
      \ while Mountain Time is UTC-7. Generally, the more easterly a location is in\
      \ the US, the earlier the time zone. So Florida is in Eastern Time, which is\
      \ east of Central, which is east of Mountain. So Phoenix, being in Mountain\
      \ Time, is west of Florida. Therefore, Florida State University in Tallahassee\
      \ is east of the University of Phoenix. Therefore, University of Phoenix is\
      \ west of FSU. Therefore, the answer is NO, it's not located east of FSU.\n\n\
      Alternatively, maybe I should check the approximate longitudes. Let's see: Tallahassee's\
      \ longitude is around 84.28\xB0W (I remember that from looking up before). Phoenix\
      \ is around 112\xB0W. Since 84\xB0W is east of 112\xB0W (because lower longitude\
      \ in the west), Tallahassee is east of Phoenix. Therefore, Phoenix is west of\
      \ Tallahassee, so University of Phoenix is west of FSU. So the answer is NO.\n\

      \ the University of Phoenix in Arizona is located east of Florida State University\
      \ in Florida. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably\
      \ figure out where each university is located. The University of Phoenix is\
      \ in Arizona, but Arizona is a big state. Wait, the main campus? I think the\
      \ University of Phoenix is an online university, but they have a physical campus\
      \ in Phoenix, Arizona. Florida State University is in Tallahassee, Florida.\
      \ So the locations are Phoenix, AZ, and Tallahassee, FL.\n\nNow, I need to determine\
      \ their relative positions east or west of each other. Since both are in the\
      \ US, I should consider their longitudes. Places with higher longitude (more\
      \ to the east) are further east. Wait, but longitude can be a bit tricky because\
      \ the US spans from the eastern to the western hemisphere. The eastern states\
      \ like Florida are on the east coast, and Arizona is in the southwest. \n\n\
      Thinking about the map of the US, Florida is on the eastern side, and Arizona\
      \ is in the southwest, near California. So Tallahassee is in the eastern part\
      \ of Florida. Phoenix is in central Arizona. Generally, the west coast is California,\
      \ Oregon, Washington, and Arizona is just east of California. So Phoenix would\
      \ be west of Florida. \n\nBut to be precise, I should check the approximate\
      \ longitudes. Let me recall: Tallahassee, FL is located around 84.28\xB0 W longitude.\
      \ Phoenix, AZ is around 112.07\xB0 W longitude. Wait, but longitude west is\
      \ measured as negative degrees, so the more west you go, the higher the numerical\
      \ value (but more negative). So a higher west longitude (like 112\xB0W) is further\
      \ west than a lower west longitude (84\xB0W). Therefore, Phoenix, AZ at 112\xB0\
      W is west of Tallahassee, FL at 84\xB0W. That means Tallahassee is east of Phoenix,\
      \ so Phoenix is west of Tallahassee. Therefore, the University of Phoenix in\

      \ to figure out the relative positions of these two places. \n\nFirst, I should\
      \ recall where both universities are. UCLA is in Los Angeles, which is on the\
      \ west coast of the US. Wisconsin is in the Midwest, right? Madison is the capital\
      \ of Wisconsin. So UCLA is in California, which is a western state, and Wisconsin\
      \ is more to the east compared to California. But wait, east or west can be\
      \ tricky because of the Earth's curvature. \n\nI think the key here is to look\

      \ Wait, so if the longitude of Madison is 89\xB0W and UCLA is 118\xB0W, then\

      \ the lower the longitude number in the west. \n\nWait, let me confirm. Let's\
      \ take coordinates. UCLA's coordinates are approximately 34.07\xB0 N latitude,\

      \ so a higher numerical value (like 120\xB0W) is further west than a lower one\
      \ (like 90\xB0W). So if Madison has a lower longitude (i.e., less west), then\
      \ it's further east, and Los Angeles has a higher longitude (more west), so\
      \ further west. Therefore, UCLA would be west of Madison, which would mean Madison\
      \ is east of UCLA. So the question is asking if UCLA is east of Madison. If\
      \ Madison is east of UCLA, then UCLA is west of Madison, so the answer would\
      \ be NO.\n\nBut let me confirm the actual longitudes. Let me think: Los Angeles\
      \ is around 118\xB0W longitude. Madison, Wisconsin, I think is around 89\xB0\
      W. For example, Chicago is around 87\xB0W, so Madison, being a bit west of Chicago,\
      \ maybe 89\xB0W. So Los Angeles at 118\xB0W is much further west. Therefore,\
      \ Madison is east of Los Angeles, which means UCLA (in LA) is west of Madison.\
      \ Therefore, the answer is NO, UCLA is not east of the University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Madison College of Engineering.\n</think>To determine if UCLA is east of the\

      \ **89\xB0W**.  \n2. **East vs. West**: Lower longitude (closer to 0\xB0) means\
      \ further east. Since 89\xB0W is east of 118\xB0W, Madison is east of Los Angeles.\
      \  \n\n**Answer**: NO. UCLA is west of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison\
      \ College of Engineering."

      \ question is whether UCLA in California is east of the University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Madison College of Engineering in Wisconsin. Hmm, first I need to know the locations\
      \ of both universities. \n\nUCLA is in Los Angeles, CA. I know Los Angeles is\
      \ on the west coast of the US, so that's pretty far west. The University of\
      \ Wisconsin\u2013Madison is in Madison, Wisconsin. Wisconsin is in the Midwest,\
      \ more towards the eastern part of the US compared to California. \n\nWait,\
      \ but to determine if one is east of the other, I should look at their longitudes.\
      \ Places with higher longitude east are more east. Wait, no, longitude west\
      \ is measured as negative in the US. So the more east you go, the lower the\
      \ longitude (since west longitude decreases as you go east). Let me confirm\
      \ that. \n\nLongitude lines run north-south. The prime meridian is 0\xB0, and\
      \ longitude increases to the west as negative numbers (in the Western Hemisphere).\
      \ So for example, Los Angeles is around 118\xB0W, and Madison is around 89\xB0\
      W. Wait, no, Madison is in the Midwest, so its longitude should be west too\
      \ but less than Los Angeles. Let me check approximate coordinates.\n\nUCLA's\
      \ coordinates are approximately 34.0689\xB0 N, 118.4451\xB0 W. University of\
      \ Wisconsin-Madison's College of Engineering is in Madison, WI, which is approximately\
      \ 43.0731\xB0 N, 89.4012\xB0 W. \n\nSo comparing the longitudes: UCLA is at\
      \ 118.4451\xB0W, and Madison is at 89.4012\xB0W. Since longitude west values\
      \ decrease as you move east, Madison has a smaller west longitude, meaning it's\
      \ further east than UCLA. Therefore, UCLA is west of Madison. So the question\
      \ is asking if UCLA is east of Madison. Since Madison is at a more easterly\
      \ longitude (89\xB0W vs. 118\xB0W), then UCLA is actually west of Madison. Therefore,\
      \ the answer would be NO.\n</think>NO. UCLA in Los Angeles, CA, has a longitude\
      \ of approximately 118\xB0W, while the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison\
      \ in Wisconsin is around 89\xB0W. Since lower west longitude values are further\
      \ east, Madison is east of Los Angeles. Thus, UCLA is **west** of the University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, making the answer NO."

      \ whether UCLA in Los Angeles, CA is located east of the University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Madison College of Engineering in Wisconsin. Hmm, I need to figure out the geographical\
      \ positions of both places. \n\nFirst, I know that UCLA is in Los Angeles, which\
      \ is on the west coast of the United States. So that's in California, which\
      \ is a western state. On the other hand, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison\
      \ is in Madison, Wisconsin. Wisconsin is in the Midwest, more towards the northern\
      \ part of the US. \n\nNow, I need to determine their relative east-west positions.\
      \ Generally, the west coast is much further west than the Midwest. For example,\
      \ California is in the Pacific Time Zone, while Wisconsin is in the Central\
      \ Time Zone. Time zones in the US go from Eastern, Central, Mountain, to Pacific,\
      \ each one hour apart moving west. So Pacific Time is three hours behind Eastern.\
      \ Since Wisconsin is Central, that's two hours ahead of Pacific. So that suggests\
      \ that Wisconsin is east of California.\n\nBut maybe I should check the actual\
      \ longitudes. Longitude measures east-west position. Places with higher longitude\
      \ (more to the east) have higher numbers in the western hemisphere (since west\
      \ longitudes are negative when using the standard coordinate system where east\
      \ is positive). Wait, no, actually, in the US, all longitudes are west of the\
      \ prime meridian, so they are negative numbers. For example, Los Angeles is\
      \ around 118 degrees West longitude, and Madison, Wisconsin is around 89 degrees\
      \ West. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The prime meridian is 0 degrees,\
      \ and as you go west, the longitude increases in the negative direction. So\
      \ Los Angeles is approximately 118.25\xB0 W, and Madison is around 89.4\xB0\
      \ W. \n\nWait, but longitude west is measured as negative in some systems. So\
      \ if we consider decimal degrees, Los Angeles would be at approximately -118.25,\
      \ and Madison at -89.4. The more east a location is, the higher the longitude\
      \ value (less negative). So Madison, being at -89.4, is east of Los Angeles,\
      \ which is at -118.25. Therefore, UCLA (Los Angeles) is west of Madison, Wisconsin.\
      \ So the question is asking if UCLA is east of Wisconsin-Madison. Since Madison\
      \ is more east (less west), the answer would be no. UCLA is west of Madison,\
      \ not east. \n\nSo the answer should be NO.\n</think>NO. UCLA is located in\

      \ in the US, especially compared to the Midwest. Wisconsin is north-central,\
      \ so east of California. But wait, directions can be tricky. Let me get more\
      \ precise.\n\nI remember that longitude determines east-west positioning. Places\
      \ with a higher longitude (more to the east) are further east. Let's look up\
      \ the approximate longitudes. \n\nUCLA's coordinates: Los Angeles is roughly\
      \ around 34\xB0N latitude, 118\xB0W longitude. The University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Madison: Madison, WI is approximately 43\xB0N latitude, 89\xB0W longitude. \n\
      \nWait, longitude is measured in degrees west or east from the prime meridian.\

      Madison, making the answer **NO**."
    ea797b3e-570c-47ca-926b-4a50b0e0dba8: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ UCLA in California is east of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison College\
      \ of Engineering in Wisconsin. Let me start by recalling where these two places\
      \ are located. \n\nFirst, UCLA is in Los Angeles, California. I know that California\
      \ is on the west coast of the United States. Los Angeles is a major city there,\
      \ so its coordinates are probably around 34 degrees north latitude and 118 degrees\
      \ west longitude. \n\nThen, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison is in Madison,\
      \ Wisconsin. Wisconsin is in the Midwest, north of Illinois. Madison is the\
      \ capital city of Wisconsin. I think Madison's coordinates are roughly 43 degrees\
      \ north latitude and 89 degrees west longitude. \n\nNow, to determine if one\
      \ place is east of another, I need to compare their longitudes. East and west\
      \ are determined by longitude; the further east a location is, the smaller its\
      \ longitude value (since longitude decreases as you go east from the prime meridian).\
      \ Wait, no. Actually, longitude increases as you go east from the prime meridian\
      \ (0\xB0), up to 180\xB0, and decreases as you go west. So in the case of the\
      \ United States, which is west of the prime meridian, all longitudes are west\
      \ (negative if using east/west +/\u2212 notation). So, for example, Los Angeles\
      \ is at around 118\xB0 West, and Madison is around 89\xB0 West. \n\nWait, wait.\
      \ Let me correct that. If we are using the standard longitude where west longitudes\
      \ are negative when using a coordinate system where east is positive. So for\
      \ example, the prime meridian is 0\xB0, and as you go west, the longitude becomes\
      \ negative in the western hemisphere. So Los Angeles is at approximately -118\xB0\
      , and Madison is at around -89\xB0. However, when comparing east and west, a\
      \ location with a more easterly longitude (less negative or a higher number\
      \ if we consider absolute values) is further east. \n\nWait, this might be confusing.\
      \ Let's think numerically. Suppose we have two points: Point A is at 89\xB0\
      \ West, and Point B is at 118\xB0 West. Which one is further east? Since 89\xB0\
      \ West is closer to the prime meridian than 118\xB0 West, Point A (89\xB0W)\
      \ is east of Point B (118\xB0W). So, in terms of numerical values, 89\xB0W is\
      \ less than 118\xB0W when measured in degrees west. Therefore, Madison, WI at\
      \ 89\xB0W is east of Los Angeles, CA at 118\xB0W. Therefore, UCLA (Los Angeles)\
      \ is west of Madison, so the question is whether UCLA is east of Wisconsin-Madison.\
      \ Since Los Angeles is at a more westerly longitude (higher number in west),\
      \ it's actually further west. Therefore, the answer should be NO, UCLA is not\
      \ east of UW-Madison.\n\nAlternatively, to confirm, I can look up approximate\
      \ longitudes. Let's check: \n\nUCLA's coordinates are approximately 34.0689\xB0\
      \ N, 118.4451\xB0 W. \n\nUniversity of Wisconsin\u2013Madison's College of Engineering\
      \ is in Madison, WI. Madison's coordinates are approximately 43.0730\xB0 N,\
      \ 89.4012\xB0 W.\n\nComparing the longitudes: UCLA is 118.4451\xB0 W and Madison\
      \ is 89.4012\xB0 W. Since 89.4 is east of 118.4 (because lower longitude west\
      \ means more east), Madison is east of UCLA. Therefore, UCLA is west of Madison,\
      \ so the answer is NO, UCLA is not east of UW-Madison.</think>NO  \nTo determine\
      \ if UCLA is east of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison College of Engineering,\

      \ the University of Michigan College of Engineering in Michigan is located east\
      \ of Duke University in North Carolina. Hmm, first, I need to know the locations\
      \ of both universities. \n\nSo, the University of Michigan is in Ann Arbor,\
      \ Michigan. I remember that Michigan is one of the northern states, near the\
      \ Great Lakes. Duke University is in Durham, North Carolina. North Carolina\
      \ is on the East Coast, sort of in the southeastern part of the US. \n\nWait,\
      \ but I'm not exactly sure about their exact longitudes. Maybe I should think\
      \ about the general positions. Michigan is more to the north and west compared\
      \ to North Carolina. For example, Michigan is in the Midwest, near Chicago,\
      \ whereas North Carolina is further south and east, bordering the Atlantic Ocean.\
      \ So if the University of Michigan is in Michigan, which is further west, and\
      \ Duke is in NC, which is further east, then maybe Michigan is actually west\

      \ which is east of the Appalachian Mountains. \n\nWait, longitude-wise, the\
      \ eastern states like North Carolina would have higher longitude values (more\
      \ east) compared to Michigan, which is in the Midwest. For example, New York\
      \ is at around 74 degrees west longitude, while Michigan is maybe around 83-84\
      \ degrees west. Let me check mentally: the prime meridian is in Greenwich, so\
      \ moving west from there, the US is in the western hemisphere. So, lower longitude\
      \ numbers (closer to 0) are more east. Wait no, longitude west of the prime\
      \ meridian is measured in degrees west, so 75\xB0W is further east than 80\xB0\
      W. So if Ann Arbor is at, say, 83\xB0W and Durham is at 78\xB0W, then Durham\
      \ is further east (since 78 is less than 83). Wait, no, because longitude west\
      \ means the higher the number, the further west. So a higher degree west means\
      \ more west. So if Ann Arbor is at 83\xB0W and Durham at 78\xB0W, then Ann Arbor\
      \ is west of Durham. Therefore, Durham (Duke) would be east of Ann Arbor. Therefore,\
      \ University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) is west of Duke University, so Duke is\

      W. Durham, NC: I think Duke is around 78.9\xB0W. So 83.7 is further west than\
      \ 78.9, meaning Ann Arbor is west of Durham. So the University of Michigan is\

      \ to 0) than Durham, then it would be east of Durham. If it's higher, it would\
      \ be west.\n\nLet me look up the coordinates. \n\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann\

      \ wait. Let me confirm these numbers. Ann Arbor, MI longitude is approximately\
      \ 83.7\xB0 W. Durham, NC is around 78.9\xB0 W. \n\nSo comparing those two longitudes,\
      \ Durham's longitude is 78.9\xB0 W, and Ann Arbor's is 83.7\xB0 W. Since longitude\

      \ (more west), so Ann Arbor is west of Durham. Therefore, the University of\

      \ the University of Michigan College of Engineering in Michigan is located east\
      \ of Duke University in North Carolina. Let me break this down step by step.\n\
      \nFirst, I need to figure out the locations of both universities. Let's start\
      \ with the University of Michigan. The main campus of the University of Michigan\
      \ is in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I remember that Ann Arbor is a city in the southeastern\
      \ part of Michigan, near Detroit. So, the College of Engineering is part of\
      \ the Ann Arbor campus, right?\n\nNext, Duke University is in Durham, North\
      \ Carolina. Durham is in the central part of North Carolina, part of the Research\
      \ Triangle area along with Raleigh and Chapel Hill. Now, comparing the two states:\
      \ Michigan is a northern state, while North Carolina is in the southeastern\
      \ U.S. But the question is about east-west positioning. \n\nNow, I should check\
      \ the longitude coordinates of both cities because longitude determines east-west\
      \ position. The higher the longitude (in the western hemisphere), the further\
      \ west a location is. \n\nAnn Arbor, MI: Let me recall or maybe look up the\
      \ approximate longitude. Ann Arbor is around 83.7 degrees West. Wait, actually,\
      \ I might be mixing up some numbers. Let me think. Detroit is about 83.05\xB0\
      \ W. Ann Arbor is west of Detroit, so its longitude would be a bit higher. Let's\
      \ say approximately 83.7\xB0 W. \n\nDurham, NC: The longitude for Durham is\
      \ around 78.9\xB0 W. For example, Raleigh, which is nearby, is about 78.6\xB0\
      \ W. So Durham might be similar. Let's go with 78.9\xB0 W. \n\nComparing the\
      \ two longitudes: Ann Arbor is at ~83.7\xB0 W, and Durham at ~78.9\xB0 W. So,\
      \ Ann Arbor has a higher longitude (more west) than Durham. That means Durham\
      \ is east of Ann Arbor. Wait, no: lower longitude (closer to the prime meridian)\
      \ is more east. So if Durham is 78.9\xB0W and Ann Arbor is 83.7\xB0W, Durham\
      \ is east of Ann Arbor. Therefore, the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) is\
      \ west of Duke University (Durham). Therefore, the answer would be NO, because\
      \ the question is whether UMich's College of Engineering is east of Duke. Since\
      \ UMich is west, the answer is no. \n\nWait a moment, let me double-check those\
      \ longitude numbers. Maybe I'm off. Let me verify coordinates:\n\nAnn Arbor,\
      \ MI: According to a quick check in my mind, Ann Arbor's coordinates are approximately\

      \ approximately 35.99\xB0 N, 78.90\xB0 W. \n\nYes, so Durham's longitude is\
      \ 78.90\xB0W, and Ann Arbor's is 83.74\xB0W. Since lower longitude (more towards\
      \ the east), Durham is east of Ann Arbor. Therefore, University of Michigan\
      \ (Ann Arbor) is west of Duke (Durham). Thus, the answer is NO.\n</think>NO\
      \  \nThe University of Michigan College of Engineering is located in Ann Arbor,\
      \ MI, at approximately **83.74\xB0 W** longitude. Duke University is in Durham,\
      \ NC, at approximately **78.90\xB0 W** longitude. Since lower longitude values\
      \ indicate a more easterly position in the western hemisphere, Durham (Duke)\

      \ whether the University of Michigan College of Engineering in Michigan is located\
      \ east of Duke University in North Carolina. Hmm, I need to figure out the locations\
      \ of both universities and their relative positions. \n\nFirst, I know that\
      \ the University of Michigan is in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Duke University is in\
      \ Durham, North Carolina. So I need to compare the longitude of Ann Arbor, MI,\
      \ and Durham, NC. Because east and west are determined by longitude; is ( is\
      \ ( is ( is (higher longitude in the western hemisphere?), wait, no\u2014actually,\
      \ in the context of the United States, which is in the western hemisphere, longitude\
      \ west of the Prime Meridian. So higher longitude values mean further west?\
      \ Wait, no. Let me clarify. Longitude lines run from north to south, and measure\
      \ east or west of the Prime Meridian (0\xB0). For the US, all longitudes are\
      \ west, so they're measured as degrees west, meaning the numbers increase as\
      \ you go west. So, for example, New York is around 74\xB0W, Chicago around 87\xB0\
      W, Los Angeles around 118\xB0W. So the higher the longitude number (more west),\
      \ the further west the location.\n\nSo, if Ann Arbor, MI is further west than\
      \ Durham, NC, then Michigan would be west of Duke, meaning Duke is east of Michigan.\
      \ Alternatively, if Durham, NC has a lower longitude (more east) than Ann Arbor,\
      \ MI, then Duke is east of Michigan. Wait, no. Wait, longitude: places to the\
      \ east have lower longitude values (since you're moving east from the Prime\
      \ Meridian, but in the US, everything is west longitude). Wait, maybe I should\
      \ check approximate longitudes.\n\nLet me recall: Durham, NC is in North Carolina,\
      \ which is on the East Coast, but not as far as, say, New York. Ann Arbor is\
      \ in Michigan, which is in the Midwest. So Michigan is further west than North\
      \ Carolina? Wait, geographically, Michigan is north of Indiana and Ohio, which\
      \ are west of Pennsylvania and east of Illinois. North Carolina is south of\
      \ Virginia, which is south of Pennsylvania. So in terms of east-west, Michigan\
      \ is west of Ohio, which is west of Pennsylvania, which is west of New Jersey,\
      \ etc. So North Carolina is south but also east compared to Michigan? Wait,\
      \ maybe not. Let me think of a map. If you look at the US, Michigan's Lower\
      \ Peninsula is located to the north of Indiana and Ohio. North Carolina is southeast\
      \ of Ohio. So, for example, Ohio is east of Michigan? Wait, no. Michigan is\
      \ to the north and west of Ohio. Because Ohio is south of Michigan Ohio's Ohio's\
      \ Ohio's Ohio's longitude is around 82-83\xB0W (Columbus is about 83\xB0W).\
      \ Ann Arbor, MI is near Detroit, which is around 83\xB0W as well. Wait, but\
      \ Detroit is on the eastern edge of Michigan. So Ann Arbor is west of Detroit,\
      \ maybe around 83.7\xB0W? Let me check approximate coordinates.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe I can recall that Durham, NC is at approximately 78\xB0W longitude.\
      \ For example, Duke University's coordinates are approximately 36.0014\xB0 N,\
      \ 78.9389\xB0 W. Wait, that's latitude 36.0014, longitude -78.9389. So Durham\
      \ is around 78.9\xB0W. \n\nUniversity of Michigan in Ann Arbor is at approximately\
      \ 42.2780\xB0 N, 83.7382\xB0 W. So longitude is about 83.7\xB0W. \n\nComparing\
      \ the two longitudes: Durham is 78.9\xB0W, Ann Arbor is 83.7\xB0W. Since longitude\
      \ increases as you go west, Ann Arbor is further west than Durham. Therefore,\
      \ Duke University (Durham, NC) is east of the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor,\
      \ MI). So the question is asking if UMich is east of Duke. Since UMich is at\
      \ 83.7\xB0W and Duke is at 78.9\xB0W, UMich is west of Duke. Therefore, the\
      \ answer is NO.\n</think>NO  \nThe University of Michigan College of Engineering\
      \ is located in Ann Arbor, MI, at approximately 83.7\xB0W longitude, while Duke\
      \ University is in Durham, NC, at around 78.9\xB0W. Since lower longitude values\
      \ (further east) indicate a more easterly location in the Western Hemisphere,\
      \ Duke University lies east of the University of Michigan. Thus, Michigan's\
      \ engineering campus is **west** of Duke, making the answer NO."

      \ So, the user wants to know if the University of Texas at Austin College of\
      \ Liberal Arts in Texas is located east of the Graduate School of Duke University\
      \ in North Carolina. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure out the locations of\
      \ both universities. \n\nStarting with the University of Texas at Austin (UT\
      \ Austin). I remember that Austin is the capital of Texas. Texas is a big state,\
      \ and Austin is located in the central part, maybe a bit towards the east within\
      \ the state. But wait, the exact coordinates might help. Let me recall: Austin's\
      \ approximate latitude and longitude. I think Austin is around 30\xB0 N, 97\xB0\
      \ W. \n\nNow, Duke University's Graduate School is in North Carolina. Duke is\
      \ in Durham, North Carolina. Where is Durham located? North Carolina is on the\
      \ East Coast, so Durham is in the northeastern part of the state. Let me check\
      \ Durham's coordinates. From memory, Durham is near 36\xB0 N, 78\xB0 W. \n\n\
      Wait, longitude is key here because east vs. west is determined by longitude.\
      \ The further east (lower longitude west) a place is, the more eastward it is.\
      \ So if Austin is at 97\xB0 W and Durham is at 78\xB0 W, then Durham is actually\
      \ further east because 78 is less than 97. So, Austin is west of Durham. Therefore,\
      \ the University of Texas at Austin's College of Liberal Arts would be west\
      \ of Duke's Graduate School. So the answer should be NO, because Austin is west,\
      \ not east, of Durham, NC.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Maybe I mixed up the\
      \ longitudes. Let me verify. If Austin is at 97\xB0 W and Durham at 78\xB0 W,\
      \ then moving east from Austin would mean going towards lower longitude numbers\
      \ (since west longitude decreases as you go east). So Durham is east of Austin.\
      \ Therefore, Austin is west of Durham, so the College of Liberal Arts at UT\
      \ Austin is west of Duke's Graduate School. Hence, the answer is NO.\n</think>To\
      \ determine if the University of Texas at Austin College of Liberal Arts (UT\

    0bd7ae2d-a6c6-40bb-a38f-efa51e25b643: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure out if\
      \ the University of Texas at Austin College of Liberal Arts is east of the Graduate\

      \ locations of both institutions. \n\nThe University of Texas at Austin is obviously\
      \ in Austin, Texas. The College of Liberal Arts is part of that university,\
      \ so it's in the same city. Then Duke University's Graduate School is in Durham,\
      \ North Carolina. So the question is about comparing the longitude of Austin,\
      \ TX, and Durham, NC. Because east and west are determined by longitude; the\
      \ further east a place is (higher longitude if we're talking east of the prime\
      \ meridian, but in the US, since it's west of the prime meridian, the more east\
      \ you go, the lower the longitude becomes? Wait, no. Let me get that straight.\
      \ Prime meridian is 0 degrees, and longitude increases going west up to 180.\
      \ So in the Americas, all longitudes are west, so they're measured as degrees\
      \ west, which would be negative if using the eastern hemisphere as positive.\
      \ Wait, maybe I need to check the actual coordinates.\n\nAustin, TX: Let me\
      \ recall. Austin is in central Texas. Texas is a large state, but Austin is\
      \ more towards the eastern part of Texas, but still central. Its longitude is\
      \ approximately 97.75 degrees west. So that's 97.75\xB0 W. \n\nDurham, NC: North\
      \ Carolina is on the east coast. Durham is in the central part of North Carolina,\
      \ part of the Research Triangle. I think Durham's longitude is around 78.9 degrees\
      \ west. Let me confirm that. Yeah, if I remember, Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill\
      \ area is around 78-79\xB0 W longitude. \n\nSo comparing the two: Austin is\
      \ at ~97\xB0W, Durham at ~79\xB0W. Since longitude decreases as you go east,\
      \ the further east a location is, the smaller the longitude number (in the western\
      \ hemisphere). So Durham, being at 79\xB0W, is east of Austin, which is at 97\xB0\
      W. Wait, no. Wait, higher longitude west means further west? Let me think. If\
      \ you're at 100\xB0W, you're west of someone at 90\xB0W. So yes, the higher\
      \ the longitude west, the further west the location. So if Austin is 97\xB0\
      W and Durham is 78\xB0W, then Durham is to the east of Austin. Therefore, the\
      \ University of Texas at Austin is west of Duke's Graduate School. So the question\
      \ is asking if UT Austin's College of Liberal Arts is east of Duke's Grad School.\
      \ Since Austin is west of Durham, the answer would be NO. \n\nWait, but is there\
      \ any chance that maybe within the cities, the specific campuses are oriented\
      \ differently? Probably not significant. The main campuses are in those cities.\
      \ So the answer should be NO. The College of Liberal Arts at UT Austin is located\

      \ values (west of the Prime Meridian) indicate positions further east, Durham,\
      \ NC (78.9\xB0 W) is east of Austin, TX (97.75\xB0 W). Therefore, **UT Austin's\

      \ Austin, Texas is around 97.7 degrees west longitude. Durham, North Carolina\

      \ of Austin, Texas, and Durham, North Carolina. Since longitude determines east-west\
      \ position. If Durham is further east, then Austin would be west of Durham.\
      \ But wait, even though Texas is a southern state, its eastern border is still\
      \ west of North Carolina. For example, the easternmost point in Texas is near\
      \ the Louisiana border. Louisiana is east of Texas, but North Carolina is further\
      \ east than Louisiana. So, even the easternmost part of Texas is west of North\
      \ Carolina. Therefore, Austin, being in central Texas, would definitely be west\
      \ of Durham, NC. \n\nSo, the question is: Is UT Austin's College of Liberal\
      \ Arts east of Duke's Graduate School? Since Austin is west of Durham, the answer\
      \ should be NO. But let me double-check to be sure. Maybe look up approximate\
      \ longitudes. Austin's longitude is around 97.7\xB0 W. Durham, NC is approximately\
      \ 78.9\xB0 W. Wait, longitude is measured from the prime meridian, with west\
      \ longitudes being negative. So the lower the number (closer to 0), the more\
      \ eastward. So 78.9\xB0 W is further east than 97.7\xB0 W. Therefore, Durham\
      \ is east of Austin. So Austin is west of Durham, which means UT Austin is not\
      \ east of Duke. So the answer is NO.\n</think>To determine if the University\

      \ I need to figure out where both universities are located geographically.\n\
      \nStarting with Northwestern University. I know Northwestern is in Illinois,\
      \ but where exactly? Let me recall... I think it's in Evanston, which is a suburb\
      \ just north of Chicago. So, Chicago is in northeastern Illinois, right along\
      \ Lake Michigan. That would place Northwestern in the northern part of Illinois,\
      \ near the lake. \n\nNow, the University of Georgia. That's in Georgia, obviously.\
      \ The main campus is in Athens, Georgia. Athens is northeast of Atlanta, if\
      \ I remember correctly. So, Georgia is a southeastern state, so Athens would\
      \ be in the northern part of Georgia, but still in the southeastern United States.\n\
      \nNext, I need to determine their longitudinal positions. The key here is which\
      \ one is farther east. Since longitude determines east-west positioning, the\
      \ one with a higher longitude (more east) would be further east. Let me think\
      \ about the approximate longitudes. \n\nChicago, Illinois, is around 87.6 degrees\
      \ west longitude. Evanston, being a suburb, is very close to that. So Northwestern's\
      \ longitude is roughly 87.7\xB0W. \n\nAthens, Georgia, on the other hand, I\
      \ believe is further east. Let me check my memory... Atlanta's longitude is\
      \ about 84.4\xB0W, and Athens is a bit east of Atlanta. So maybe around 83.4\xB0\
      W? That would mean the University of Georgia is at a longitude of approximately\
      \ 83.4\xB0W. \n\nComparing the two, 83.4\xB0W (Georgia) is east of 87.7\xB0\
      W (Northwestern) because as you go east, the longitude decreases in the western\
      \ hemisphere (since west longitude is measured from the Prime Meridian going\
      \ west). So, lower numerical value in west longitude means further east. \n\n\
      Wait, to confirm: longitude lines run north-south, with values increasing as\
      \ you go west from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0) up to 180\xB0W. So, a place at\
      \ 80\xB0W is east of a place at 90\xB0W. Therefore, since 83.4\xB0W is less\
      \ than 87.7\xB0W, the University of Georgia is east of Northwestern University.\
      \ \n\nTherefore, Northwestern University in Illinois is actually west of the\

      \ that Georgia is in the southeastern part of the US, right? Atlanta is the\
      \ capital, and the University of Georgia is in Athens, which is near Atlanta.\
      \ \n\nNow, Northwestern University is in Illinois. Illinois is in the Midwest,\
      \ right? Chicago is a major city there, and I think Northwestern is in Evanston,\
      \ which is a suburb north of Chicago. So, I need to compare the longitude of\
      \ Evanston, IL, and Athens, GA. Because east and west are determined by longitude.\
      \ Places with higher longitude (more to the east) are further east. Wait, no,\
      \ longitude lines run north-south, and the prime meridian is in Greenwich. But\
      \ in the US, all longitudes are west of the prime meridian, so they're measured\
      \ as west longitude. So, a lower (more negative) longitude value would actually\
      \ be further east. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Longitude\
      \ is measured from 0\xB0 at Greenwich, England, going east to 180\xB0 and west\
      \ to -180\xB0. In the US, all locations are west of the prime meridian, so their\
      \ longitudes are in the west, meaning negative values if we're using the convention\
      \ where east longitudes are positive and west are negative. However, sometimes\
      \ they are just stated as degrees west. But regardless, when comparing two places\
      \ in the US, the one with the smaller longitude (more eastern) would be further\
      \ east. For example, New York City is around 74\xB0W, while Los Angeles is about\
      \ 118\xB0W. So NYC is further east because 74 is less than 118. So the lower\
      \ the longitude number (if we ignore the west designation and just consider\
      \ the numerical value), the further east the location.\n\nSo, to answer the\
      \ question, I need the exact longitudes of Evanston, IL (Northwestern) and Athens,\
      \ GA (University of Georgia). Let me try to recall or estimate. \n\nAthens,\
      \ GA: I know Atlanta is around 84\xB0W. Athens is a bit east of Atlanta, maybe?\
      \ Wait, no, I think Atlanta is in the northwest part of Georgia. So maybe Athens\
      \ is to the east or southeast. Wait, actually, Athens is northeast of Atlanta.\
      \ Wait, perhaps I should check approximate coordinates. Let me think. The University\
      \ of Georgia's coordinates: according to what I remember, Athens, GA is approximately\
      \ 33.95\xB0 N latitude, 83.38\xB0 W longitude. \n\nNorthwestern University in\
      \ Evanston, IL: Evanston is north of Chicago. Chicago's downtown is around 41.88\xB0\
      \ N, 87.63\xB0 W. Evanston would be a bit north of that, so latitude higher,\
      \ but longitude similar. Let's say approximately 87.7\xB0 W. \n\nSo comparing\
      \ the two longitudes: Athens at ~83.38\xB0 W and Evanston at ~87.7\xB0 W. Since\
      \ 83.38 is less than 87.7, that means Athens is further east (because it's a\
      \ smaller longitude west). Therefore, Evanston (Northwestern) is west of Athens\
      \ (UGA). Therefore, Northwestern is west of UGA, so the answer is NO, it's not\
      \ east; it's west.\n</think>To determine if Northwestern University (IL) is\
      \ east of the University of Georgia (GA), compare their longitudes.  \n- **University\
      \ of Georgia (Athens, GA):** Approx. 83.38\xB0 W longitude.  \n- **Northwestern\
      \ University (Evanston, IL):** Approx. 87.70\xB0 W longitude.  \n\nSince lower\
      \ longitude values (closer to 0\xB0) indicate positions further east, Athens,\
      \ GA (83.38\xB0 W) is east of Evanston, IL (87.70\xB0 W).  \n\n**NO**"
    63d0fc2f-c070-4622-a582-5333ed5a77be: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Northwestern University in Illinois is located east of the University\
      \ of Georgia in Georgia. I need to figure out the answer step by step.\n\nFirst,\
      \ I should determine the locations of both universities. Northwestern University\
      \ is in Illinois, and the University of Georgia is in Georgia. Now, I need to\
      \ find out where exactly each is situated within their respective states.\n\n\
      Starting with Northwestern: I remember that Northwestern University is in Evanston,\
      \ Illinois. Evanston is a city just north of Chicago, so it's in the northeastern\
      \ part of Illinois, near Lake Michigan. So, the coordinates would be somewhere\
      \ around 42.05\xB0 N, 87.68\xB0 W maybe? I think Chicago is around 41.88\xB0\
      \ N, 87.63\xB0 W, so Evanston would be a bit north of that.\n\nNow, the University\
      \ of Georgia (UGA) is in Athens, Georgia. Athens is northeast of Atlanta. The\
      \ coordinates for Athens are approximately 33.96\xB0 N, 83.38\xB0 W. Atlanta\
      \ is around 33.75\xB0 N, 84.39\xB0 W, so Athens is a bit to the east and north\
      \ of Atlanta.\n\nNext, comparing their longitudes. Northwestern's Evanston campus\
      \ is at about 87.68\xB0 W. UGA in Athens is around 83.38\xB0 W. Longitude measures\
      \ east-west position, with lower numbers being further east (since longitude\
      \ decreases as you go east towards the Prime Meridian at 0\xB0). So, 83.38\xB0\
      \ W is east of 87.68\xB0 W. That would mean that the University of Georgia is\
      \ east of Northwestern. But wait, the question is the reverse: is Northwestern\
      \ east of UGA? If UGA is at 83.38\xB0 W and Northwestern is at 87.68\xB0 W,\
      \ then Northwestern is actually further west. Because the lower the longitude\
      \ (in the western hemisphere), the further east it is. For example, New York\
      \ is around 74\xB0 W, which is east of Chicago's 87\xB0 W. So, since 83 is a\
      \ smaller number than 87, UGA is east of Northwestern. Therefore, Northwestern\
      \ is west of UGA. So the answer would be NO, Northwestern is not east of UGA;\
      \ it's west.\n\nWait, just to double-check: Let me verify the longitudes again.\
      \ Northwestern in Evanston, IL: Yes, Evanston is near Chicago, and Chicago's\
      \ longitude is around 87.6\xB0 W. Athens, GA is around 83.38\xB0 W. So yes,\
      \ 83.38 is east of 87.68, meaning Northwestern is west of UGA. So the answer\
      \ is NO.\n</think>To determine if Northwestern University (IL) is east of the\
      \ University of Georgia (GA):  \n1. **Locations**:  \n   - Northwestern is in\

      \ (83.38\xB0 W) has a smaller longitude value than Northwestern (87.68\xB0 W),\
      \ placing it farther east.  \n\n**Conclusion**: Northwestern University is **west**\
      \ of the University of Georgia.  \n\n**Answer**: NO."

      \ Is Northwestern University in Illinois located east of the University of Georgia\
      \ in Georgia? Hmm, okay. First, I need to recall where these two universities\
      \ are located. \n\nNorthwestern University is in Evanston, Illinois, right?\
      \ I remember that Evanston is a suburb just north of Chicago. So, Chicago is\
      \ in northeastern Illinois, near Lake Michigan. That puts Northwestern in the\
      \ northern part of Illinois, close to the lake.\n\nNow, the University of Georgia\
      \ is in Athens, Georgia. I think Athens is northeast of Atlanta, the capital\
      \ of Georgia. Georgia is a southern state, so it's definitely south of Illinois.\
      \ But east or west? Let me visualize a map. Illinois is in the Midwest, while\
      \ Georgia is in the southeastern United States. \n\nSo, comparing their longitudes.\
      \ Chicago, being in Illinois, is around 87.6 degrees west longitude. Atlanta,\
      \ Georgia, is about 84.3 degrees west. Wait, longitude decreases as you go east.\
      \ So a lower longitude number means further east. So if Chicago is 87.6\xB0\
      W and Atlanta is 84.3\xB0W, that means Atlanta is east of Chicago. Therefore,\
      \ the University of Georgia (in Athens, GA) would be east of Northwestern (Evanston,\
      \ IL). \n\nBut wait, Evanston is a bit north of Chicago. Does that affect the\
      \ longitude? Not really; latitude affects north-south, longitude east-west.\
      \ So even if Evanston is slightly north, its longitude should be similar to\
      \ Chicago's. So Northwestern's longitude would still be around 87.7\xB0W or\
      \ so. \n\nAthens, GA's longitude is about 83.4\xB0W according to a quick mental\
      \ check. So comparing 87.7\xB0W (Northwestern) to 83.4\xB0W (UGA), since 83.4\
      \ is smaller, UGA is further east. Therefore, Northwestern is west of UGA, meaning\
      \ UGA is east of Northwestern. So the answer would be NO, Northwestern is not\
      \ east of UGA; it's west of it.\n</think>NO. Northwestern University in Evanston,\
      \ IL, is located at approximately 87.7\xB0W longitude, while the University\
      \ of Georgia in Athens, GA, is around 83.4\xB0W longitude. Since lower longitude\
      \ values are farther east, the University of Georgia is east of Northwestern\
      \ University. Thus, Northwestern is **west** of the University of Georgia. \n\
      \n**Answer:** NO."

      \ is about 84.4 degrees West, and Athens is a bit east of Atlanta, so maybe\
      \ around 83.4 degrees West or so? Wait, no\u2014if Atlanta is 84.4 W and Athens\

      \ a lower longitude than Athens, GA, then it's further east.\n\nSo I need to\
      \ find the longitude of Evanston, IL and Athens, GA. Let me think. Evanston\

      \ Let's say approximately 87.7\xB0W. \n\nAthens, GA is in northeastern Georgia.\

      \ longitude decreases. For example, Atlanta is around 84.4\xB0W, and Athens,\
      \ being east of Atlanta, would have a longitude like 83.4\xB0W or something.\
      \ Wait, but I need to check that. Let me think. If you're in the US, moving\
      \ eastward, the longitude becomes smaller (since you're moving towards the prime\
      \ meridian at 0\xB0). So, for example, New York is around 74\xB0W, which is\
      \ east of Chicago (87\xB0W). So if Athens is east of Atlanta, then its longitude\
      \ is less (more east) than Atlanta's. So Atlanta is 84.4\xB0W, so Athens might\

      \ of both universities and then determine their relative positions, specifically\
      \ which one is further east.\n\nFirst, I should recall where each university\
      \ is located. Northwestern University is in Illinois. I know that Illinois is\
      \ in the Midwest, and Chicago is a major city there. Northwestern's main campus\
      \ is in Evanston, which is a suburb just north of Chicago. So Evanston, IL is\
      \ the location. \n\nOn the other hand, the University of Georgia is in Georgia,\
      \ which is a southern state on the East Coast. The main campus is in Athens,\
      \ GA. Athens is northeast of Atlanta, the capital of Georgia. \n\nNow, I need\
      \ to compare the longitudes of Evanston, IL and Athens, GA because longitude\
      \ determines east-west position. The further east a location is (higher longitude\
      \ in the western hemisphere?), wait, no. Actually, in the context of the United\
      \ States, the eastern states have higher longitude values because longitude\
      \ increases as you go east. Wait, no, longitude is measured from the prime meridian\
      \ (0\xB0), which goes through Greenwich, England. So for the US, which is west\
      \ of the prime meridian, all longitudes are negative when using the common WGS84\
      \ system. So a location further east would have a less negative (closer to zero)\
      \ longitude than one further west. \n\nSo, for example, New York City is around\
      \ -74\xB0 longitude, while Chicago is around -87.6\xB0. So NYC is east of Chicago\
      \ because -74 is higher (less negative) than -87.6. \n\nSo, to compare Evanston,\
      \ IL and Athens, GA, I need their approximate longitudes. Let me think. Evanston,\
      \ IL is near Chicago. Chicago's longitude is approximately 87.6\xB0 West, which\
      \ is -87.6 in decimal degrees. Athens, GA is in northeastern Georgia. Let me\
      \ recall that Atlanta, GA is around -84.4\xB0 longitude. Athens is a bit east\
      \ of Atlanta, so maybe around -83.4\xB0 or so? Let me check mentally. If Atlanta\
      \ is at about 84.4\xB0W, then moving east from Atlanta would decrease the longitude\
      \ (since east in the western hemisphere means getting closer to the prime meridian).\
      \ Wait, no. Wait, longitude decreases as you go east in the western hemisphere.\
      \ For example, moving east from Chicago (87.6\xB0W) towards New York (74\xB0\
      W), the longitude becomes less west, so the numerical value decreases. So if\
      \ Atlanta is at 84.4\xB0W, then moving east into Georgia, towards the Atlantic\
      \ coast, the longitude would be less than 84.4\xB0W. So Athens, being northeast\
      \ of Atlanta, would have a longitude a bit less than 84.4\xB0W. Let's say approximately\
      \ 83.5\xB0W. \n\nSo Evanston, IL is at about 87.6\xB0W, and Athens, GA is at\
      \ about 83.5\xB0W. Since 83.5\xB0W is east of 87.6\xB0W (because 83.5 is less\
      \ than 87.6 in the west longitude), that would mean Athens, GA is east of Evanston,\
      \ IL. Therefore, Northwestern University (Evanston) is west of the University\

      \ W. Evanston is just north of Chicago, so its longitude should be very close,\
      \ maybe 87.69\xB0 W. \n\nAthens, GA: The University of Georgia is in Athens,\
      \ which is in Clarke County. The coordinates for Athens are approximately 33.9557\xB0\
      \ N, 83.3833\xB0 W. So that's 83.3833\xB0 W. \n\nComparing the two: Evanston\

      \ higher its longitude (in the Western Hemisphere). MIT is in Cambridge, MA.\
      \ Let me recall, Boston's longitude is around 71 degrees west. Syracuse, NY's\
      \ longitude is about 76 degrees west. Wait, no, wait. Wait, longitude for Boston\
      \ is actually around 71\xB0W. For Syracuse, I think it's approximately 76\xB0\
      W. Wait, but hold on\u2014higher longitude west means further west. So if Syracuse\
      \ is at 76\xB0W and MIT is at 71\xB0W, then Syracuse is actually further west\
      \ than MIT. Because 76 is a larger number west, meaning it's more to the west.\
      \ So that would mean MIT is east of Syracuse, not the other way around. \n\n\
      Wait, maybe I got that mixed up. Let me confirm. Longitude: as you go east in\
      \ the US, the longitude decreases (since we're in the western hemisphere, longitude\
      \ is measured west from Greenwich). So, for example, New York City is around\
      \ 74\xB0W, Boston is around 71\xB0W. Since Syracuse is around 76\xB0W, which\
      \ is further west than NYC. Therefore, MIT is at 71\xB0W, Syracuse at 76\xB0\
      W. So MIT is east of Syracuse. Therefore, Syracuse is west of MIT. So the question\
      \ is: Is Syracuse east of MIT? The answer would be no. \n\nTherefore, the answer\
      \ should be NO. Because Syracuse is located west of MIT in terms of longitude.\
      \ Let me double-check. Maybe look up approximate coordinates. \n\nMIT's coordinates:\
      \ Cambridge, MA is approximately 42.36\xB0 N, 71.09\xB0 W.\nSyracuse University:\
      \ Syracuse, NY is approximately 43.04\xB0 N, 76.14\xB0 W. \n\nComparing the\
      \ longitudes: 76.14\xB0 W (Syracuse) vs 71.09\xB0 W (MIT). Since lower longitude\
      \ (smaller number) means further east. So 71.09 is east of 76.14. Therefore,\
      \ MIT is east of Syracuse, so Syracuse is west of MIT. Hence, the answer is\
      \ NO, Syracuse University is not east of MIT; it's to the west.\n</think>NO\
      \  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Locations:** Syracuse University\
      \ is in Syracuse, NY (approx. 76.14\xB0 W longitude). MIT is in Cambridge, MA\
      \ (approx. 71.09\xB0 W longitude).  \n2. **Longitude Comparison:** Lower longitude\
      \ in the Western Hemisphere means further east.  \n3. **Conclusion:** MIT (71.09\xB0\
      \ W) is east of Syracuse (76.14\xB0 W). Thus, Syracuse is **west** of MIT, not\
      \ east.  \n\n**Answer:** NO"

      \ eastern side of Massachusetts, right along the coast. So MIT's location is\
      \ pretty far east in the state.\n\nNow, Syracuse University is in Syracuse,\
      \ New York. Where is Syracuse in New York state? New York state is to the west\
      \ of Massachusetts. Syracuse is in upstate New York, which is the northern part\
      \ of the state but more towards the center or western part. Wait, Syracuse is\
      \ actually in central New York, not the far west like Buffalo. But compared\
      \ to Massachusetts, which is east of New York, would Syracuse be east or west\
      \ of MIT?\n\nWait, no. Let me get this straight. Massachusetts is to the east\
      \ of New York. So if MIT is in eastern Massachusetts (Boston area), and Syracuse\
      \ is in central New York, then Syracuse would be west of MIT. Because New York\
      \ state is west of Massachusetts. So Syracuse, being in New York, is west of\
      \ the Massachusetts border. Therefore, MIT in eastern MA would be east of Syracuse.\
      \ So Syracuse University is west of MIT, meaning the answer is NO, it's not\
      \ east of MIT.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check the exact longitudes. Let me\
      \ think. Boston's longitude is around 71 degrees west. Syracuse, NY's longitude\
      \ is about 76 degrees west. Since longitude increases as you go west, a higher\
      \ degree west means further west. So 76\xB0W is west of 71\xB0W. Therefore,\
      \ Syracuse is west of Boston (MIT), so MIT is east of Syracuse. Therefore, Syracuse\

    96a5bbfb-51db-4955-85d0-fdbf524c506a: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user is asking if Syracuse University in New York is located east\

      \ Cambridge is right next to Boston, right? So, Cambridge is in the eastern\

      \ I know MIT is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Syracuse University is in Syracuse,\

      \ Boston, which is on the eastern side of Massachusetts. So maybe Syracuse is\
      \ actually west of MIT.\n\nBut I should check the exact longitudes. Longitude\
      \ determines how east or west a location is. The more east (higher longitude\
      \ in the western hemisphere?), no, wait, longitude in the western hemisphere\
      \ is measured west of the prime meridian, so lower numbers are more east? Wait,\
      \ no\u2014the Prime Meridian is 0\xB0, and as you go west, the longitude becomes\
      \ negative. So for the US, which is west of the Prime Meridian, all longitudes\
      \ are negative. So a smaller number (more negative) is further west, and a larger\
      \ number (closer to zero) is further east.\n\nSo, Cambridge, MA: Let me recall.\
      \ Boston's longitude is around -71.06\xB0. Syracuse, NY's longitude is approximately\
      \ -76.22\xB0. Wait, wait, if MIT is in Cambridge, MA, which is part of the Boston\
      \ area, so its longitude is about -71.06. Syracuse is at around -76.22. So comparing\
      \ these two, -71.06 is larger (less negative) than -76.22. That means MIT is\
      \ further east because its longitude is closer to zero. Therefore, Syracuse\
      \ is west of MIT. So the answer would be NO, Syracuse University is not east\
      \ of MIT; it's west of MIT.\n\nWait, let me double-check the longitudes. Maybe\
      \ I should look up approximate coordinates. Syracuse, NY: approximately 43.0389\xB0\
      \ N, 76.1349\xB0 W. Wait, 76.13\xB0 West longitude. Cambridge, MA: 42.3736\xB0\
      \ N, 71.1097\xB0 W. So yes, MIT is at around 71.1\xB0 W, Syracuse at 76.1\xB0\
      \ W. Since higher longitude west means further west. So 76.1\xB0 W is further\
      \ west than 71.1\xB0 W. Therefore, Syracuse is west of MIT, so the answer is\
      \ NO.\n</think>To determine if Syracuse University, NY is east of MIT, MA:\n\

      \ mean a lower longitude (more towards the east). Since 122\xB0W is a higher\
      \ number west than 71\xB0W, that means San Francisco is actually further west\
      \ than Boston. So, Boston is east of San Francisco, which would make San Francisco\
      \ west of Boston. Therefore, UCSF is not east of Boston University; it's actually\
      \ west. \n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check the exact coordinates. Let\
      \ me think. Boston University's coordinates: Boston, MA is at approximately\

      W vs. 71.06\xB0W. Since longitude increases as you go west, 122\xB0W is much\
      \ further west than 71\xB0W. Therefore, San Francisco is west of Boston, so\

      \ locations of both universities and then determine their relative positions,\
      \ specifically which one is further east. \n\nFirst, I should recall where each\
      \ university is. Boston University is in Boston, MA, which is on the east coast\
      \ of the United States. UCSF is in San Francisco, California, which is on the\
      \ west coast. So, at first glance, San Francisco is west of Boston, but let\
      \ me verify that.\n\nWait, east and west can be a bit confusing. If you're comparing\
      \ two points in the US, the one further east would have a higher longitude (since\
      \ longitude increases going east from the prime meridian). But in the US, the\
      \ eastern part of the country has higher longitude values compared to the western\
      \ part. Wait, no, actually, the continental US spans from approximately 67 degrees\
      \ west longitude (east coast, like Maine) to around 125 degrees west longitude\
      \ (west coast, like Washington state). So higher longitude numbers are actually\
      \ further west. Wait no, longitude is measured from 0 degrees at the prime meridian\
      \ (Greenwich, England) going east and west up to 180. So for the US, which is\
      \ west of the prime meridian, all longitudes are in the west, so they are measured\
      \ as degrees west. So higher degrees west mean further west. For example, New\
      \ York is around 74 degrees west, while San Francisco is about 122 degrees west.\
      \ Wait, but longitude for San Francisco would be 122\xB0W, and Boston is around\
      \ 71\xB0W. Wait, no, Boston is on the east coast, so its longitude is around\
      \ 71 degrees west (since going west from Greenwich). San Francisco is much further\
      \ west, so around 122 degrees west. So Boston's longitude is 71\xB0W, San Francisco\
      \ is 122\xB0W. Since longitude increases westward in the western hemisphere,\
      \ the higher the number, the further west. So San Francisco is further west\
      \ than Boston. Therefore, Boston is east of San Francisco. Wait, but the question\
      \ is asking if UCSF is east of Boston. So since San Francisco is at 122\xB0\
      W and Boston is at 71\xB0W, San Francisco is west of Boston. That would mean\
      \ UCSF is west of Boston University, so the answer would be NO, it's not east;\
      \ it's west.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the exact coordinates. Let me think:\
      \ Boston University is in Boston, Massachusetts. The coordinates of Boston are\
      \ approximately 42.36\xB0 N latitude, 71.06\xB0 W longitude. UCSF is in San\
      \ Francisco, California. The coordinates for San Francisco are approximately\

      \ is 71.06\xB0W, San Francisco is 122.42\xB0W. Since 122.42\xB0W is a higher\
      \ degree west, that means San Francisco is further west. Therefore, San Francisco\
      \ is west of Boston. So the University of California, San Francisco is west\
      \ of Boston University, not east. Therefore, the answer is NO.</think>NO. The\
      \ University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) is located at approximately\
      \ 122.42\xB0 W longitude, while Boston University is at around 71.06\xB0 W longitude.\

      \ which is a state in the southwestern United States. I know that Arizona is\
      \ in the Mountain Time Zone or maybe the Pacific sometimes? Wait, no, Arizona\
      \ mostly uses Mountain Standard Time but doesn't observe daylight saving time,\
      \ so they align with Pacific Time during part of the year. But time zones aside,\

      \ is in the northeastern US, on the East Coast. So, Harvard is definitely on\
      \ the east side of the country. Now, the question is whether Arizona State,\
      \ being in the southwest, is east of Harvard. \n\nWait, but how does longitude\
      \ work here? The US spans from the Atlantic coast on the east (like Massachusetts)\
      \ to the Pacific on the west. So, the further east you go, the higher the longitude\
      \ (if we're talking east longitude), but actually, in the US, all longitudes\
      \ are west. So, higher west longitude would be further west. For example, the\
      \ East Coast is around 70-80 degrees West longitude, and the West Coast is around\
      \ 120 degrees West. \n\nArizona's longitude: Let me think. Phoenix, where ASU\

      \ 71 degrees West. So, comparing the two, 112\xB0W vs. 71\xB0W. Since lower\

      \ Let me check the longitudinal coordinates. Longitude measures east-west position.\

      \ According to a quick recall, Tempe is near Phoenix. Phoenix's longitude is\
      \ around 112 degrees West. Cambridge, MA: Harvard is around 71 degrees West.\
      \ So, 71\xB0W vs. 112\xB0W. Since longitude increases as you go west from the\

      \ longitude is around 71\xB0W. \n\nArizona State's main campus is in Tempe,\
      \ AZ. Where is Tempe located? Tempe is near Phoenix. Phoenix, AZ's longitude\
      \ is about 112\xB0W. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, Phoenix is around\
      \ 112\xB0W. But wait, if Harvard is 71\xB0W and Arizona is 112\xB0W, then Arizona\
      \ is actually west of Harvard. Because longitude increases as you go west, but\
      \ west longitude is measured as negative in some systems. Wait, in terms of\
      \ degrees west, the more west you go, the higher the numerical value. So if\
      \ Tempe, AZ is around 112\xB0W and Cambridge, MA is 71\xB0W, then Tempe is further\
      \ west. So that would mean Arizona State is west of Harvard, not east. Therefore,\
      \ the answer should be NO.\n\nBut wait, maybe I got the longitudes mixed up.\
      \ Let me double-check. For example, the longitude of Cambridge, MA: According\
      \ to what I remember, Boston is approximately 71\xB003'W. Phoenix, AZ is around\
      \ 112\xB004'W. Since 112 is further west than 71, Phoenix (and thus ASU) is\
      \ west of Cambridge (Harvard). So that means Harvard is east of ASU, so ASU\
      \ is west of Harvard. Therefore, the answer is NO, Arizona State University\
      \ is not east of Harvard Summer School; it's west.\n</think>To determine if\

      \ whether Arizona State University in Arizona is located east of Harvard Summer\
      \ School in Massachusetts. Hmm, I need to figure out the geographical positions\
      \ of both places. \n\nFirst, I know that Arizona is a state in the southwestern\
      \ part of the US. Massachusetts is in the northeastern part. So, generally,\
      \ Massachusetts is east of Arizona. But wait, the question is about the specific\
      \ locations of the universities. \n\nArizona State University (ASU) is in Tempe,\
      \ Arizona. Harvard Summer School is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Let me recall\
      \ the approximate longitudes of these cities. Longitude determines east-west\
      \ position. The further east (higher longitude in the western hemisphere?),\
      \ wait no, actually, in the US, as you go east, the longitude decreases because\
      \ the US is in the western hemisphere. Wait, longitude is measured from the\
      \ prime meridian. So, places in the east (like Massachusetts) have a lower longitude\
      \ (more westward from the prime meridian?), no, wait, longitude west of the\
      \ prime meridian is measured in degrees west, so higher numbers as you go west.\
      \ For example, New York is around 74\xB0W, while Los Angeles is around 118\xB0\
      W. So, the further west you go, the higher the longitude (in the western hemisphere).\
      \ So, if a place has a higher longitude (more west), it's further west.\n\n\
      So, Cambridge, MA: I think its longitude is around 71\xB0W. Tempe, AZ: Let me\
      \ check. Phoenix, Arizona is around 112\xB0W. Tempe is part of the Phoenix metro\
      \ area, so probably similar. So 112\xB0W vs 71\xB0W. Since 71 is less than 112,\
      \ that means Cambridge is east of Tempe. Therefore, ASU in Arizona is west of\
      \ Harvard in Massachusetts. So, the question is asking if ASU is east of Harvard.\

      Let me confirm that. For example, New York City is around 74 degrees west longitude,\

      \ I should confirm the locations of both institutions. I know that Columbia\
      \ University is in New York City, specifically in Manhattan. The School of International\
      \ and Public Affairs is part of Columbia, so it's likely located on their main\
      \ campus in Morningside Heights, Manhattan. I've heard that Columbia's main\
      \ campus is around 116th Street and Broadway, which is in the upper west side\
      \ of Manhattan.\n\nNow, Cornell University is a bit more complicated because\
      \ it has different campuses. The main campus for Cornell is in Ithaca, New York,\
      \ which is upstate, quite a distance from NYC. But wait, the question specifically\
      \ mentions the College of Veterinary Medicine. I think some of Cornell's graduate\
      \ or professional schools might be in different locations. Let me recall...\
      \ Cornell has two main campuses: the main one in Ithaca, and another in New\
      \ York City, right? Wait, no, maybe the medical school? Let me think. I believe\
      \ Cornell's Weill Cornell Medical College is in NYC, part of the Cornell University\
      \ system. But the College of Veterinary Medicine\u2014I'm pretty sure that's\
      \ in Ithaca. Yes, because veterinary schools often need more space for facilities\
      \ like farms, animal hospitals, etc., which are more feasible in a rural area\
      \ like Ithaca rather than Manhattan.\n\nSo if Cornell's Vet Med is in Ithaca,\
      \ and Columbia's SIPA is in NYC (Manhattan), then the next step is to determine\
      \ their relative positions. Ithaca is in upstate New York, northwest of New\
      \ York City. Wait, let me check the cardinal directions. If you look at a map,\
      \ New York City is in the southeastern part of New York State. Ithaca is in\
      \ the Finger Lakes region, which is central-western part of the state. So from\
      \ NYC, Ithaca is to the northwest. Therefore, Ithaca would be west of NYC. But\
      \ wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me visualize the state: NYC is at the\
      \ bottom southeast, Albany is north along the Hudson, then Syracuse is northwest\
      \ of Albany, and Ithaca is southwest of Syracuse. So overall, Ithaca is west\
      \ and a bit north of NYC. So that would mean that Cornell's Vet Med is west\
      \ of Columbia's SIPA. Therefore, the answer would be NO, since it's not east\
      \ but west.\n\nBut wait, could there be a part of Cornell in NYC that's east\
      \ of Columbia? The Weill Cornell Medicine is on the Upper East Side of Manhattan,\
      \ right? So the medical campus is at 1300 York Avenue, which is around 68th\
      \ Street and York Ave. Columbia's main campus is at 116th and Broadway, which\
      \ is further uptown but on the west side. So York Avenue is on the east side\
      \ of Manhattan. So Weill Cornell Medicine in NYC is east of Columbia's campus.\
      \ But the question is about the College of Veterinary Medicine, not the medical\
      \ school. So yes, the Vet school is in Ithaca, which is northwest of NYC. Therefore,\
      \ even though Cornell has a presence in NYC (east of Columbia), the specific\
      \ college in question is in Ithaca, which is west. So the answer is NO.\n</think>**Step\
      \ 1: Locate Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs\

      \ Medicine.**  \nCornell's veterinary school is part of its main campus in **Ithaca,\
      \ NY**, approximately 225 miles northwest of NYC. Veterinary facilities require\

    2e979250-fa78-4f73-bb2a-25d8b11eecc2: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user wants to know if Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine\
      \ in New York is located east of the School of International and Public Affairs\
      \ (SIPA) at Columbia University, also in New York. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I need\
      \ to figure out where each of these schools is located. Let's start with Columbia\
      \ University's SIPA. Columbia University is in New York City, specifically in\
      \ the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. The exact address for SIPA\
      \ is 420 West 118th Street, New York, NY. So that's Manhattan, which is part\
      \ of New York City.\n\nNow, Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\
      \ Wait, Cornell's main campus is in Ithaca, NY, which is upstate. But does the\
      \ vet school have a different location? Let me check. From what I remember,\
      \ the College of Veterinary Medicine is part of Cornell's main campus in Ithaca.\
      \ So Ithaca is in upstate New York, about 4-5 hours northwest of NYC by car.\
      \ \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a branch or another campus? I should confirm.\
      \ A quick search shows that the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine\
      \ is indeed located in Ithaca, NY. Their address is 930 Campus Road, Ithaca,\
      \ NY 14853. So that's definitely in Ithaca, which is in Tompkins County, central\
      \ New York State.\n\nNow, comparing the locations. Columbia's SIPA is in Manhattan,\
      \ which is at the southern part of New York State, along the eastern side (since\
      \ Manhattan is on the east coast). Ithaca, on the other hand, is in central\
      \ NY but more to the west compared to NYC. Wait, but when you look at a map,\
      \ Ithaca is actually west of NYC. Let me think about the coordinates. \n\nManhattan's\
      \ coordinates are approximately 40.7128\xB0 N, 74.0060\xB0 W. Ithaca's coordinates\
      \ are around 42.4440\xB0 N, 76.5019\xB0 W. So, latitude-wise, Ithaca is north\
      \ of NYC. Longitude-wise, since longitude west becomes more negative as you\
      \ go west, 76.5\xB0 W is further west than 74.0\xB0 W. So Ithaca is west of\
      \ NYC. Therefore, the College of Veterinary Medicine is west of Columbia's SIPA.\
      \ \n\nBut the question is whether it's east. So if Ithaca is west of NYC, then\
      \ the answer would be NO. Because being west of Columbia (which is in NYC) means\
      \ it's not east. So the answer should be NO.\n</think>Cornell University's College\
      \ of Veterinary Medicine is located in Ithaca, NY, which is northwest of New\
      \ York City. Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs\
      \ is in Manhattan, NY. Since Ithaca lies west of Manhattan, the College of Veterinary\
      \ Medicine is **not** east of Columbia's SIPA. \n\n**Answer:** NO."
    5efb0ba2-b1ee-49ca-9c4e-353da103a544: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure out if\
      \ Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine in NY is east of Columbia\
      \ University's School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) in NY. \n\n\
      First, I need to recall where both institutions are located. Cornell University\
      \ is in Ithaca, NY, right? I've heard that Ithaca is in upstate New York, which\
      \ is more towards the northern part of the state. But wait, the College of Veterinary\
      \ Medicine is part of Cornell, so it should be in Ithaca as well.\n\nOn the\
      \ other hand, Columbia University is in New York City, specifically in Manhattan.\
      \ The School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) is one of Columbia's\
      \ graduate schools, so it's located in NYC as well. Now, the question is about\
      \ their relative positions: is the Vet Med school east of SIPA?\n\nI need to\
      \ think about the geography. Ithaca is in central New York, west of the Hudson\
      \ River. New York City is in the southeastern part of New York State. So, if\
      \ I picture a map of NY, NYC is at the lower part (south), and Ithaca is northwest\
      \ of NYC. Wait, no. Let me check directions. Ithaca is actually to the northwest\
      \ of NYC. Because upstate NY is north, but Ithaca is more towards the western\
      \ part of the state. So like, if NYC is on the eastern edge (since it's on the\
      \ Atlantic coast), Ithaca is inland, further west. \n\nSo, if Columbia's SIPA\
      \ is in NYC (eastern part of the state), and Cornell's Vet school is in Ithaca\
      \ (western part), then Ithaca would be west of NYC. Therefore, the Vet Med college\
      \ would be west of Columbia's SIPA. But the question asks if it's east. So the\
      \ answer would be No. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Maybe I'm getting the\
      \ directions mixed up. Let me think about the coordinates. NYC is at approximately\
      \ 40.7128\xB0 N, 74.0060\xB0 W. Ithaca is around 42.4430\xB0 N, 76.5000\xB0\
      \ W. Comparing the longitude: the more west the longitude, the higher the number\
      \ (since longitude increases going west from the prime meridian). So NYC is\
      \ at -74.0060, and Ithaca is at -76.5000. Since 76.5 is more west than 74, Ithaca\
      \ is indeed west of NYC. So, if something is west of another point, then the\
      \ other point is east of it. Therefore, Cornell Vet Med (Ithaca) is west of\
      \ Columbia SIPA (NYC), so the answer is NO, it's not east\u2014it's west.\n\
      </think>To determine the relative locations:\n\n1. **Cornell's College of Veterinary\
      \ Medicine** is in **Ithaca, NY** (coordinates ~42.4430\xB0 N, 76.5000\xB0 W).\
      \  \n2. **Columbia's SIPA** is in **New York City, NY** (coordinates ~40.7128\xB0\
      \ N, 74.0060\xB0 W).  \n\nSince **Ithaca** has a more **westerly longitude**\
      \ (-76.5 vs. -74.0), it lies **west** of NYC.  \n\nANSWER: NO"
    6b561612-074d-4783-bb3f-98a1eceb6c15: "<think>Okay, so the question is asking\
      \ if Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine in New York is located\

      \ figure out where each of these schools is located. I know that Cornell University\
      \ is in Ithaca, NY. But wait, the College of Veterinary Medicine is part of\

      \ is in New York City, specifically in Manhattan. The School of International\
      \ and Public Affairs (SIPA) is part of Columbia, so it's in Manhattan as well.\n\
      \nNow, I need to determine the geographical positions of Ithaca and Manhattan.\
      \ Ithaca is in upstate New York, while Manhattan is in the southeastern part\
      \ of the state. To figure out which is more east, I should look at their longitudes.\
      \ The longitude of Ithaca, NY is approximately 76.5 degrees West. Manhattan,\
      \ being in NYC, has a longitude around 73.9 degrees West. \n\nWait, longitude\
      \ coordinates: the lower the number (more negative when considering west as\
      \ negative), the further east it is. So 73.9\xB0W is actually further east than\
      \ 76.5\xB0W because 73.9 is a smaller number (closer to the prime meridian).\
      \ So Ithaca (76.5\xB0W) is west of NYC (73.9\xB0W). Therefore, Cornell's Vet\
      \ Med in Ithaca is west of Columbia's SIPA in NYC. So the answer would be NO,\
