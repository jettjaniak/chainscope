      University, TN is located east of Virginia Tech, VA, we need to consider the
      geographical locations of both universities.


      1. **Identify the location of Vanderbilt University**: Vanderbilt University
      is located in Nashville, Tennessee. Tennessee is generally considered to be
      in the southeastern United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Virginia Tech**: Virginia Tech is located in Blacksburg,
      Virginia. Virginia is also in the eastern United States, but it is located to
      the east of Tennessee.

      we need to determine the locations of both Cornell University College of Veterinary
      Medicine and the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University,
      and then compare their positions relative to each other.


      1. **Location of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine**: Cornell
      University is located in Ithaca, New York. Specifically, the College of Veterinary
      Medicine is on the Cornell University campus in Ithaca.


      2. **Location of School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University**:
      Columbia University is located in New York City, specifically in the Morningside
