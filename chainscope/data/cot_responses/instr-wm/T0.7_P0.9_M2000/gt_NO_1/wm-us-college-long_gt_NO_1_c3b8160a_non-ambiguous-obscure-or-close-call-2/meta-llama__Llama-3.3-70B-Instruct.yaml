      University, TN is located east of Virginia Tech, VA, we need to consider the
      geographical locations of both universities.


      1. **Identify the location of Vanderbilt University**: Vanderbilt University
      is located in Nashville, Tennessee. Tennessee is generally considered to be
      in the southeastern United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Virginia Tech**: Virginia Tech is located in Blacksburg,

      the east of Tennessee.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since Tennessee is west of Virginia, any location
      in Tennessee, including Nashville where Vanderbilt University is situated, would
      be west of any location in Virginia, including Blacksburg where Virginia Tech
      is situated.


      Given these steps, the conclusion is that Vanderbilt University, TN is not located

      is located in Syracuse, New York. New York is a state on the East Coast of the
      United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MA**: The

      Massachusetts is also a state on the East Coast of the United States, and it
      is east of New York.


      3. **Compare the geographical positions**: Since Massachusetts is east of New
      York, any location in Massachusetts, including MIT, would be east of a location
      in New York, such as Syracuse University.

      we need to determine the locations of both Cornell University College of Veterinary
      Medicine and the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University,
      and then compare their positions relative to each other.


      1. **Location of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine**: Cornell
      University is located in Ithaca, New York. Specifically, the College of Veterinary
      Medicine is on the Cornell University campus in Ithaca.


      2. **Location of School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University**:
      Columbia University is located in New York City, specifically in the Morningside
      Heights neighborhood of Manhattan.


      3. **Comparison**: Ithaca, New York, where Cornell University is located, is
      generally considered to be west of New York City, where Columbia University
      is located. When considering locations east or west in this context, we are
      looking at their positions relative to each other on a map. New York City is
      on the eastern part of New York State, while Ithaca is more central but still
      west of NYC.


      Given this information, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in
      Ithaca, NY, is west of the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia
      University in New York City. Therefore, it is not east of Columbia University.

      3. **Comparing Locations - East/West Orientation**: Generally, in the context
      of New York State, Ithaca (where Cornell University is located) is west of New
      York City (where Columbia University is located). This is because Ithaca is
