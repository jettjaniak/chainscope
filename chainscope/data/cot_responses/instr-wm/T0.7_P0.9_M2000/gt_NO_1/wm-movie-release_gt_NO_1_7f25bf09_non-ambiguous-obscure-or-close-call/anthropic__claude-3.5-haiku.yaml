    7932c302-ef83-4002-802a-59e22352f554: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s find the release year of Seeta Aur Geeta:

      - Seeta Aur Geeta was released in 1972

      - It was directed by Ramesh Sippy

      - It starred Hema Malini in a double role

      - Meet the Parents was released in 2000

      - It was directed by Jay Roach

      - It starred Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro


      3. Compare the release years:

      - Seeta Aur Geeta: 1972

      - Meet the Parents: 2000


      4. Determine which movie was released later:

      - 2000 is later than 1972
