    97ef1e2f-f61f-4be0-8bb4-fce435d3eae9: 'I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations.

      - Yosemite Valley is in California, on the western side of the United States.

      - Queens is a borough of New York City, located on the eastern coast of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions.

      - The United States generally spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west).

      - New York is on the Atlantic coast, in the eastern part of the country.

      - California is on the Pacific coast, in the western part of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Places in California are generally west of places in New York.

      - This means California locations have a greater western longitude than New
      York locations.

      - For something to be east of Queens, it would need to be further toward the
      Atlantic coast.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Yosemite Valley is in California (west) and Queens is in New York (east),
      Yosemite Valley is west of Queens, not east of it.


      NO, Yosemite Valley, CA is not located east of Queens, NY.'

      4) California is on the west coast of the United States.

      5) Queens is a borough of New York City, which is in New York state.

      6) Yosemite Valley is in California.

      7) Since California is west of New York, Yosemite Valley must be west of Queens.

      8) If Yosemite Valley is west of Queens, then it cannot be east of Queens.


      NO, Yosemite Valley, CA is not located east of Queens, NY. It is located to

      - The United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean
      (east).

      - Los Angeles is near the Pacific Ocean on the west coast.

      - The Bronx is near the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast.


      Step 3: Determine which is further east.

      - Moving east across the United States, you would travel from the west coast
      (where Los Angeles is) toward the east coast (where the Bronx is).

      - This means the Bronx is east of Los Angeles, not the other way around.


      NO, Los Angeles, CA is not located east of Bronx, NY. Los Angeles is west of

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both cities.

      - Compton is in California, which is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Denver is in Colorado, which is in the interior western United States.


      Step 2: Let me consider their relative positions.

      - California is located west of Colorado on a map of the United States.

      - Compton is in the Los Angeles area of Southern California.

      - Denver is in the eastern part of Colorado, but Colorado itself is entirely
      west of the eastern states.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Since Compton is in California, and California is west of Colorado, Compton
      must be west of Denver.

      - For Compton to be east of Denver, it would need to be located in a state east
      of Colorado, which is not the case.


      NO, Compton, CA is not located east of Denver, CO. It is located west of Denver.'

      - Compton is a city in southern California, near Los Angeles on the west coast.

      - Denver is the capital of Colorado, located in the central United States.


      Step 2: Consider their positions relative to each other.

      Step 3: Compare their specific locations.

      - Compton, being in California, is west of Colorado.

      - Denver, being in Colorado, is east of California.

      - Colorado is east of California, in the Rocky Mountain region.


      Step 3: More specifically, Compton is in the Los Angeles metropolitan area in
