      east of Dallas, TX, we need to compare their longitudinal coordinates. Locations
      farther to the east have a smaller (more negative) longitude in the Western
      Hemisphere.


      Step 1: Find the approximate longitude of Phoenix, Arizona.

      - Phoenix is located at approximately 112 degrees west longitude.


      Step 2: Find the approximate longitude of Dallas, Texas.

      - Dallas is located at approximately 96.8 degrees west longitude.


      Step 3: Compare the two longitudes.

      - 112 (Phoenix) is a larger number than 96.8 (Dallas) in terms of west longitude,
      meaning Phoenix is farther west than Dallas.


      Conclusion: Since Phoenix is farther west than Dallas, it is not east of Dallas.
