      on the map.


      1. **Identify the general location of each city**: San Francisco, CA is located
      on the West Coast of the United States, while Miami, FL is located on the East
      Coast.


      2. **Consider the directional relationship between the West Coast and East Coast**:
      The West Coast is generally west of the East Coast, meaning that cities on the
      West Coast are typically located to the west of cities on the East Coast.
