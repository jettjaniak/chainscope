      1. First, who is Alighiero di Bellincione?

      - He was the father of the famous Italian poet Dante Alighieri

      - He lived in Florence, Italy during the late 13th century

      - This means he lived approximately from around 1230-1280

    4edcc513-8918-4181-8a08-574f7073c7ae: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s determine when Blackbeard (Edward Teach) lived:

      - Blackbeard was a famous pirate who lived in the early 18th century

      - He was active around 1716-1718

      - He died in 1718 during a battle with the British Navy

      - So he lived to be around 35-40 years old


      2. Now, let''s look at Woodrow Wilson''s lifespan:

      - Wilson was the 28th President of the United States

      - He lived from 1856 to 1924

      - He died at age 67


      3. Comparing their lifespans:

      - Blackbeard died in 1718

      - Wilson lived from 1856 to 1924

      - Wilson lived about 200 years after Blackbeard''s death

      - Wilson also lived much longer as an individual (67 years vs. about 35-40 years)


      4. Therefore, Blackbeard did NOT live longer than Woodrow Wilson.


      Answer: NO'
