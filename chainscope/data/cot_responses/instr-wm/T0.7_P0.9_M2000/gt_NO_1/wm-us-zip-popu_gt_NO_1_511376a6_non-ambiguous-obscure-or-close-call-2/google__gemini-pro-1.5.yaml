      70130 is in Louisiana, and 10013 is in New York.

      2. **Recognize the need for population data:** To compare populations, we need
      data on the population of each zip code.

      3. **Obtain population data (external source needed):** A quick search online
      reveals population estimates for these zip codes.  (This is where a language
      model would use an external API or a lookup table if it had access.)

      4. **Compare the populations:**  Once the populations are found, compare them
      directly.

      5. **Determine the answer:** Based on the comparison, determine if 70130 is
      more populous than 10013.


      (Assuming access to a data source reveals 70130 has a smaller population than
      10013)

      70130, LA refers to a zip code in Louisiana, likely near New Orleans. 10013,
      NY refers to a zip code in New York, specifically in Manhattan.


      2. **Consider population density:** Manhattan (NY) is known for its extremely
      high population density.  Louisiana, while having some densely populated areas,
      is generally less dense than Manhattan.


      3. **Reasoning:** Given the known population densities, it''s highly likely
      that a zip code in Manhattan would be more populous than one in Louisiana.

      area. 10013, NY refers to a zip code in New York, specifically Manhattan.


      2. **Consider general population density:** Manhattan (NY) is known for its
      extremely high population density.  New Orleans (LA), while a city, is likely
      to have a lower population density than Manhattan.


      3. **Specific zip code consideration:** Zip code 10013 in Manhattan encompasses
      a very densely populated area.  While 70130 in Louisiana might cover a larger
      geographic area, the population within that area is unlikely to surpass the
      concentrated population of 10013.

      is a very densely populated area, while 90069 (West Hollywood, CA) is also densely
      populated, but likely less so than a Manhattan zip code.

      2. **Recognize the need for population data:**  I need to find population data
      for these zip codes.

      3. **Consider data sources:**  I can use online resources like the U.S. Census
      Bureau or other demographic data providers.

      4. **(Hypothetical data retrieval):** Assume I find that 10012 has a population
      of approximately X and 94133 has a population of approximately Y.  (I cannot
      access real-time data).

      5. **Compare X and Y:**  If X > Y, then 10012 is more populous. If X < Y, then
      94133 is more populous.


      Since I cannot access and process real-time data within this text-based environment,
      I cannot definitively answer.  However, if I *could* access the data, I would
      follow the above steps.  Therefore, I cannot give a YES or NO answer.

      10012 corresponds to a part of Manhattan, New York City. 94133 corresponds to
      a part of San Francisco, California.


      2. **Consider population density:** Manhattan is known for its extremely high
      population density.  While parts of San Francisco are also densely populated,
      it''s unlikely any single zip code there rivals the density of a Manhattan zip
      code.

      density of Manhattan, it''s highly probable that 10012 has a larger population
      than 94133.

      densely populated, while New Orleans zip codes (like 70112), though reasonably
      populated, are likely to have lower overall population numbers than Manhattan.  So,
