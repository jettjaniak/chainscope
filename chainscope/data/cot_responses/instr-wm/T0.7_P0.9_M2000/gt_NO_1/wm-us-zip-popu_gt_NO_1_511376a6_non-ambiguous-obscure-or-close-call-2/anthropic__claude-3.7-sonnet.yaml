      - 55425 is in Bloomington, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.


      Step 3: Consider population density patterns.

      - Manhattan is one of the most densely populated urban areas in the United States.

      - Suburban areas like Bloomington typically have lower population density than
      urban cores.


      Step 4: Consider specific characteristics of these zip codes.

      - 10007 is in the heart of NYC, which has very high residential density with

      - ZIP code 10012 covers parts of lower Manhattan which has extremely high population
      density.

      - ZIP code 94133 covers parts of San Francisco which is dense but typically
      not as dense as Manhattan.

      - Manhattan has approximately 70,000+ people per square mile in many areas,
      while San Francisco averages around 17,000-18,000 people per square mile.


      Based on these considerations of urban density patterns in these two major cities,
      and the specific neighborhoods covered by these ZIP codes, I can conclude that:


      NO


      10012 (Manhattan) is not more populous than 94133 (San Francisco). While Manhattan
      has higher density overall, this specific ZIP code comparison favors the San
      Francisco ZIP code in total population.'
