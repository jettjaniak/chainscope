      while San Francisco averages around 17,000-18,000 people per square mile.


      Based on these considerations of urban density patterns in these two major cities,
      and the specific neighborhoods covered by these ZIP codes, I can conclude that:


      NO


      10012 (Manhattan) is not more populous than 94133 (San Francisco). While Manhattan
      has higher density overall, this specific ZIP code comparison favors the San
      Francisco ZIP code in total population.'
