      \n2. **Understand the Locations**:\n   - 89109 is located in Las Vegas, Nevada.\

      \ we need to determine the population of the areas covered by the zip codes\
      \ 70112 in Louisiana (LA) and 10024 in New York (NY). Here's a step-by-step\
      \ approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Zip Codes**: First, we need to know the locations\
      \ associated with these zip codes.\n   - 70112 is located in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\
      \   - 10024 is located in Manhattan, New York City.\n\n2. **Understand the Areas**:\
      \ \n   - New Orleans is a significant city in Louisiana known for its history,\
      \ culture, and tourism. It has a population of around 393,000 people.\n   -\
      \ Manhattan, where 10024 is located, is one of the most densely populated urban\
      \ areas in the United States, with a population of over 1.6 million people.\n\
      \n3. **Consider Population Density**:\n   - New Orleans has a lower population\
      \ density compared to Manhattan, which is known for its high population density.\n\
      \   - Manhattan's population is spread over a smaller area, making it more densely\
      \ populated.\n\n4. **Research Population Figures**:\n   - The United States\
      \ Census Bureau provides population data for different areas, including zip\
      \ codes. However, the exact population figures for specific zip codes might\
      \ not be readily available in simple terms due to the nature of census data\

      \   - Without exact figures for each zip code, we consider the context. Manhattan's\
