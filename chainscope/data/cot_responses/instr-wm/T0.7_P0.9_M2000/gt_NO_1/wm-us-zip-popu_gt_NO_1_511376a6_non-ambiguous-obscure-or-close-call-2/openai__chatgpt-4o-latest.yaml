      is more populous than ZIP code 10014 in New York, we need to look at the population
      of each ZIP code.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - ZIP code 90265 corresponds to Malibu, California.

      - ZIP code 10014 corresponds to the West Village area of Manhattan, New York
      City.


      Step 2: Understand the general population characteristics of each.

      - Malibu (90265) is a relatively low-density, affluent coastal area. It is known
      for large homes, beaches, and open space. The population is not very high.

      - West Village (10014), located in Manhattan, is a much denser urban area with
      apartment buildings and a high population density.


      Step 3: Look at population estimates (numbers are approximate and based on recent
      census or data sources):

      - 90265 (Malibu): Around 12,000 to 13,000 residents.

      - 10014 (West Village): Around 30,000 to 35,000 residents.


      Step 4: Compare the numbers.

      - 10014 has significantly more residents than 90265.

      is more populous than ZIP code 11201 in New York, we need to analyze and compare
      the population sizes of these two ZIP codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations

      - ZIP code 02554 corresponds to Nantucket, Massachusetts, which is an island
      and a well-known seasonal tourist destination.

      - ZIP code 11201 corresponds to a part of Brooklyn, New York, specifically the

      populated, even at the neighborhood level. Downtown Brooklyn and Brooklyn Heights
      are densely populated residential and commercial areas.


      Step 3: Check population estimates (based on recent data)

      - 02554 (Nantucket): Population is estimated to be around 10,000-12,000 year-round
      residents.

      - 11201 (Brooklyn): Population is estimated to be roughly 50,000-60,000 residents,
