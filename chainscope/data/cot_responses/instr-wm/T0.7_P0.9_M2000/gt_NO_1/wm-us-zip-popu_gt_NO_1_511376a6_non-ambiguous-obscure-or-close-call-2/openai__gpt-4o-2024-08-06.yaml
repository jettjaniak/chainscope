      in California is more populous than 10014 in New York, we need to consider the
      general population sizes and characteristics of the areas these zip codes cover.


      1. **90265, CA**: This zip code corresponds to Malibu, California. Malibu is
      known for its affluent residents and scenic beaches but has a relatively small
      population due to its geography and the nature of housing in the area (larger
      properties and less dense development).


      2. **10014, NY**: This zip code is located in Manhattan, specifically covering
      parts of the West Village and Greenwich Village. These neighborhoods are part
      of New York City, which is known for its high population density.


      Given these characteristics:


      - Malibu (90265) is less densely populated, with larger properties and fewer
      residents.

      - The West Village and Greenwich Village (10014) are part of a densely populated
      urban area with more residents living in apartment buildings.


      Based on this analysis, the zip code 10014 in New York is more populous than
      the zip code 90265 in California.

      When comparing the two ZIP codes, it''s important to note that while 10007 is
      in a densely populated urban area, the actual residential population within

      of SoHo, NoHo, and Greenwich Village. These are densely populated neighborhoods
      known for their residential and commercial mix. However, Manhattan zip codes,
      while densely packed, often have a smaller population compared to larger residential
      areas due to high real estate prices and limited residential space.


      2. **94133, CA**: This zip code covers the North Beach and Fisherman''s Wharf
      areas in San Francisco. Similar to Manhattan, this area is urban and densely
      populated but is also a significant tourist destination. However, San Francisco''s
      neighborhoods generally have a smaller footprint compared to New York City''s.


      Given that both zip codes are in urban areas with high population density, the
      determining factor often comes down to the specific size and residential capacity
      of the neighborhoods. Historically, Manhattan zip codes tend to have higher
      populations than those in San Francisco, given the overall larger population
      of New York City compared to San Francisco.


      After considering these factors, it is likely that the population of 10012,
      NY, surpasses that of 94133, CA, given the typical population density of Manhattan
      neighborhoods.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
