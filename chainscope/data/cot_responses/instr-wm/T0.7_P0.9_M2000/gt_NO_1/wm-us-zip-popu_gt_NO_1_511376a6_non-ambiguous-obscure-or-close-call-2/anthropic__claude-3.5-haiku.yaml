      1. First, I recognize these are zip codes - 90291 is in Venice, California,
      and 10023 is on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York.


      2. To determine which is more populous, I''ll need population data for these
      specific zip codes.


      3. 10023 (Manhattan) is in a very densely populated urban area, while 90291
      (Venice) is in a coastal neighborhood of Los Angeles.


      4. Manhattan zip codes typically have very high population density. A quick
