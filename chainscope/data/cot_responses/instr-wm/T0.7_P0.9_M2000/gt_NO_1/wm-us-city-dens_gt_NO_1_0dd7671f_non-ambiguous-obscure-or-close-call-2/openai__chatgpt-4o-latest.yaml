      \ is more densely populated than Nashville, TN, let's follow a step-by-step\
      \ reasoning process.\n\n1. **Understand what \"population density\" means**:\
      \  \n   Population density is typically measured as the number of people per\
      \ square mile (or square kilometer). So, we need to compare the number of people\
      \ per square mile in Yosemite Valley vs. Nashville.\n\n2. **Yosemite Valley,\
      \ CA**:  \n   - Yosemite Valley is a small region within Yosemite National Park,\
      \ which is largely protected wilderness.  \n   - It is not a city or urban area\
      \ and has a very small resident population.  \n   - Most people in Yosemite\
      \ Valley are park employees or temporary residents.  \n   - According to census\
      \ and park data, the permanent population is minimal (likely in the hundreds\
      \ or fewer), and the area of the valley is about 7 square miles.  \n   - Even\
      \ factoring in tourists, they're not counted in permanent population for density\
      \ statistics.\n\n3. **Nashville, TN**:  \n   - Nashville is a major city and\
      \ the capital of Tennessee.  \n   - It has a population of approximately 700,000\
      \ (in the city proper) and covers about 500 square miles.  \n   - This gives\
      \ it a population density of roughly 1,400 people per square mile.\n\n4. **Compare\
      \ densities**:  \n   - Yosemite Valley: a few hundred residents over 7 square\
      \ miles \u2192 density would be under 100 people per square mile.  \n   - Nashville:\
      \ ~1,400 people per square mile.\n\nConclusion: Nashville is significantly more\
      \ densely populated than Yosemite Valley.\n\n**Answer: NO**."

      \n2. **Define the places**:  \n   - **Yosemite Valley, CA**: This is a small\

      \   - **Yosemite Valley**: The permanent population is extremely low. The area\
      \ is largely undeveloped to preserve its natural environment. Even though many\

      \ is densely populated with urban and suburban neighborhoods.\n\n4. **Compare\
      \ population density**:\n   - Yosemite Valley has a very small number of permanent\
      \ residents over a relatively large natural area.\n   - Nashville has a high\
