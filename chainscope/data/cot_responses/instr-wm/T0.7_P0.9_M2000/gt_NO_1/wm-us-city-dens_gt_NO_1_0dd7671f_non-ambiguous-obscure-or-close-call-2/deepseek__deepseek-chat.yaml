      \ population of each city:**\n   - Atlanta, GA: Approximately 498,000 people\
      \ (as of recent data).\n   - Los Angeles, CA: Approximately 3.9 million people\
      \ (as of recent data).\n\n2. **Find the land area of each city:**\n   - Atlanta,\
      \ GA: Approximately 136 square miles.\n   - Los Angeles, CA: Approximately 502\
      \ square miles.\n\n3. **Calculate the population density for each city:**\n\
      \   - Atlanta, GA: Population density = Population / Land area = 498,000 / 136\
      \ \u2248 3,662 people per square mile.\n   - Los Angeles, CA: Population density\
      \ = Population / Land area = 3,900,000 / 502 \u2248 7,769 people per square\
      \ mile.\n\n4. **Compare the population densities:**\n   - Atlanta, GA: ~3,662\
      \ people per square mile.\n   - Los Angeles, CA: ~7,769 people per square mile.\n\
      \n### Final Answer: **NO**, Atlanta, GA, is not more densely populated than\
      \ Los Angeles, CA."
