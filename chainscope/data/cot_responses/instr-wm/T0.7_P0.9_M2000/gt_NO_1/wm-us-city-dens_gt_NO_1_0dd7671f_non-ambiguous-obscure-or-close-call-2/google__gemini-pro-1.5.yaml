      density is calculated as population divided by area.  While Malibu might have
      a substantial population, its area is much larger than Manhattan''s.

      * Washington, DC has a population density of roughly 11,800 people per square
      mile.


      Therefore, Compton is *not* more densely populated than Washington, DC.

      Dallas has a larger population and land area than Beverly Hills, but that doesn''t
      automatically mean it''s more densely populated.  I need the actual figures
