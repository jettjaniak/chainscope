      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Define Population Density**: Population density is the number of people
      living in a given area. It''s typically measured in people per square mile or
      square kilometer.


      2. **Find the Population of New Orleans, LA**: As of the last available census
      data (2020), the population of New Orleans is approximately 383,997.


      3. **Find the Land Area of New Orleans, LA**: The land area of New Orleans is
      about 169 square miles.


      4. **Calculate the Population Density of New Orleans, LA**: We can calculate
      the population density by dividing the population by the land area. So, for
      New Orleans, it''s approximately 383,997 / 169 = 2,272 people per square mile.


      5. **Find the Population of Denver, CO**: According to the 2020 census, the
      population of Denver is approximately 715,522.


      6. **Find the Land Area of Denver, CO**: The land area of Denver is about 153
      square miles.


      7. **Calculate the Population Density of Denver, CO**: Using the same method
      as before, the population density of Denver is approximately 715,522 / 153 =
      4,676 people per square mile.


      8. **Compare the Population Densities**: Now, we can compare the population
      densities of New Orleans, LA (2,272 people per square mile), and Denver, CO
      (4,676 people per square mile).


      Given these calculations, Denver, CO is more densely populated than New Orleans,
