      1. Let me recall population density facts about Manhattan:

      - Manhattan has about 1.6 million people

      - Manhattan''s land area is about 23 square miles

      - This gives Manhattan a population density of roughly 70,000 people per square

      2. Now for Malibu:

      - Malibu has about 10,000 people
