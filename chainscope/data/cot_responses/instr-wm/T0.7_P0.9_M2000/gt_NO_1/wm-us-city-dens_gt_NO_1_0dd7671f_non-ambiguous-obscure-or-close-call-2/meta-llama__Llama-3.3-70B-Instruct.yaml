      let''s consider the steps needed to evaluate the population density of Malibu,
      CA, and Manhattan, NY.


      1. **Understand Population Density**: Population density is calculated by dividing
      the total population of a given area by its total land area. It''s usually expressed
      in terms of people per square mile or square kilometer.


      2. **Malibu, CA Characteristics**: Malibu is a coastal city in California known
      for its beaches, large homes, and lower population density compared to other
      parts of Los Angeles County. It has a relatively small population and a significant
      amount of land area, which includes both residential zones and vast natural
      areas.


      3. **Manhattan, NY Characteristics**: Manhattan is one of the five boroughs
      of New York City and is known for its high population density. It''s a major
      business, financial, and cultural hub with a very large population packed into
      a relatively small land area, making it one of the most densely populated urban
      areas in the world.


      4. **Comparative Analysis**: Given that Malibu has a lower population and more
      space, while Manhattan is crowded with a high population in a small area, it''s
      logical to infer that Manhattan, NY, has a significantly higher population density
      than Malibu, CA.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Malibu, CA, is more densely populated
      than Manhattan, NY, is:


      NO'

      6. **Find the area of Miami, FL**: The total area of Miami is about 35.68 square
      miles.


      7. **Calculate the population density of Miami, FL**: Divide the population
      by the area to get the density. So, for Miami, it''s approximately 442,241 people
      / 35.68 square miles = about 12,399 people per square mile.


      8. **Compare the densities**: Now, compare the population density of San Diego
      (about 4,367 people per square mile) with that of Miami (about 12,399 people
      per square mile).


      Given these calculations, the answer to whether San Diego, CA is more densely
      populated than Miami, FL is: **NO**.'

      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Understand the terms**: Yosemite Valley is a valley located in the Sierra
      Nevada mountains of California, known for its natural beauty and as part of
      Yosemite National Park. It is not a city in the conventional sense but a geographic
      and recreational area. Nashville, TN, on the other hand, is a major city in
      the United States, known for its music industry, particularly country music.


      2. **Define population density**: Population density is calculated by dividing
      the number of people living in a given area by the size of that area, usually
      expressed in square miles or square kilometers.


      3. **Consider Yosemite Valley''s population**: Yosemite Valley itself has a
      very small permanent population, mostly park rangers, employees, and a few residents.
      The exact number can fluctuate, but it''s in the hundreds, not thousands, due
      to its protected status as a national park.


      4. **Consider Nashville''s population**: Nashville, as a city, has a significant
      and large population. As of my last update, the city of Nashville has a population
      of over 691,000 people within its city limits, with the metropolitan area having
      over 1.9 million people.


      5. **Compare the sizes of the areas**: Yosemite Valley is relatively small,
      approximately 7 square miles (18 square kilometers) in size. Nashville, the
      city, covers about 525 square miles (1,359 square kilometers).


      6. **Calculate and compare the density**: Given the tiny population of Yosemite
      Valley and its small size, its population density is very low. Nashville, with
      its large population spread over a much larger area, still has a significant
      population density, especially when considering its urban core.


      Based on these steps, it''s clear that Yosemite Valley has a much lower population
      density than Nashville, TN, due to its small and limited population compared
      to the city of Nashville.

      let''s break it down:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Yosemite Valley, CA, is a valley within Yosemite
      National Park in California, known for its natural beauty and limited human
      habitation due to its protected status. Nashville, TN, is a major city in Tennessee,
      known for its music scene and significant population.


      2. **Understand population density**: Population density is calculated by dividing
      the number of people by the area they inhabit. High population density means
      a large number of people live in a relatively small area, while low population
      density means fewer people spread out over a larger area.


      3. **Consider Yosemite Valley, CA**: Yosemite Valley itself is a small area
      within Yosemite National Park, which is vast. However, the population within
      Yosemite Valley is extremely limited due to its national park status. There
      are some residents, including park rangers and staff, but the area is not open
      to widespread residential development. Thus, while the actual population might
      be small, the area of Yosemite Valley itself is also relatively small.


      4. **Consider Nashville, TN**: Nashville is a city with a significant and growing
      population. It has a substantial urban area with a high concentration of residents,
      businesses, and cultural attractions. The population density of Nashville is
      moderate to high compared to other U.S. cities, given its status as a major
      metropolitan area.


      5. **Compare the two**: Given that Yosemite Valley has a very small and limited
      population due to its protected status as part of a national park, and considering
      Nashville is a thriving city with a large and dense population, it''s reasonable
      to conclude that Nashville, TN, has a much higher population density than Yosemite
      Valley, CA.

      Valley, CA is more densely populated than Nashville, TN, let''s break down the
      information needed step by step:


      1. **Understanding Yosemite Valley, CA**: Yosemite Valley is a part of Yosemite
      National Park in California. It''s known for its natural beauty, including granite
      cliffs, waterfalls, and giant sequoia groves. Given its status as a national
      park, the area is primarily dedicated to conservation and tourism, rather than
      residential or commercial development.


      2. **Population of Yosemite Valley, CA**: Since Yosemite Valley is within a
      national park, it has a very small permanent population, mostly consisting of
      park rangers, park maintenance staff, and a few residents who live and work
      within the park. The exact population can fluctuate, but it''s generally very
      low, likely in the hundreds.


      3. **Understanding Nashville, TN**: Nashville is a major city in the state of

      small population spread over a significant area (the valley itself is about
      7.5 square miles, but the park is much larger), would have an extremely low
      population density. Nashville, with its large population and smaller area compared
      to Yosemite National Park, would have a much higher population density.


      Given these steps, it''s clear that Yosemite Valley, with its very small population

      we need to consider the population density of both Las Vegas, NV, and Brooklyn,
      NY. Population density is calculated by dividing the total population of an
      area by its total land area.


      1. **Identify the population and land area of Las Vegas, NV**: As of the last
      available data, Las Vegas has a population of approximately 648,224 people (within
      the city limits) and covers about 135.8 square miles.


      2. **Calculate the population density of Las Vegas, NV**: Using the numbers
      from step 1, we divide the population by the land area to get the population
      density. So, for Las Vegas: 648,224 people / 135.8 square miles = approximately
      4,773 people per square mile.


      3. **Identify the population and land area of Brooklyn, NY**: Brooklyn has a
      population of about 2,736,074 people and covers approximately 71 square miles.


      4. **Calculate the population density of Brooklyn, NY**: Using the numbers from
      step 3, divide the population by the land area to get the population density.
      So, for Brooklyn: 2,736,074 people / 71 square miles = approximately 38,540
      people per square mile.


      5. **Compare the population densities**: Now, we compare the calculated population
      densities of Las Vegas, NV (approximately 4,773 people per square mile), and
      Brooklyn, NY (approximately 38,540 people per square mile).


      Given these calculations, Brooklyn, NY, is significantly more densely populated
