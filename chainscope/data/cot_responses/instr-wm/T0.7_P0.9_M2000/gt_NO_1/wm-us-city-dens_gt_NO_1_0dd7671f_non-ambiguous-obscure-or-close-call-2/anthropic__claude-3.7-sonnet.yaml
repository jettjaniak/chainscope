      Step 1: Determine the population density of Malibu, CA.

      Malibu is a coastal city in California with a population of approximately 10,000-12,000
      people. It covers about 19-20 square miles of land area. This gives Malibu a
      population density of roughly 500-600 people per square mile.


      Step 2: Determine the population density of Manhattan, NY.

      Manhattan is a borough of New York City with a population of approximately 1.6-1.7
      million people. Manhattan''s land area is about 23 square miles. This gives
      Manhattan a population density of roughly 70,000-75,000 people per square mile.


      Step 3: Compare the two densities.

      Manhattan''s population density (70,000-75,000 people per square mile) is significantly
      higher than Malibu''s (500-600 people per square mile).


      NO, Malibu, CA is not more densely populated than Manhattan, NY. Manhattan is

      Step 2: Recall facts about Manhattan, NY:

      - Manhattan is one of the five boroughs of New York City

      - Manhattan is extremely densely populated

      - Manhattan has approximately 1.6 million residents

      - Manhattan''s land area is about 23 square miles

      Step 2: Recall what I know about these cities:

      - San Antonio is a major city in Texas, one of the largest cities in the US
      by population

      - Santa Monica is a smaller coastal city in the Los Angeles metropolitan area

      - San Antonio covers a much larger geographic area than Santa Monica

      - Santa Monica is known for being a relatively dense, affluent coastal community


      Step 3: Compare approximate densities:

      - San Antonio has approximately 1.5 million people spread over about 460 square
      miles, giving it a density of roughly 3,000-3,500 people per square mile

      - Santa Monica has approximately 90,000-95,000 people in about 8.4 square miles,

      significantly higher than San Antonio''s (3,000-3,500 people per square mile).

      its density would be extremely low.

      mile or square kilometer).


      Step 2: Consider Brooklyn''s characteristics.

      Brooklyn is one of New York City''s five boroughs. It''s highly urbanized with
      many apartment buildings and high-rises. Brooklyn has approximately 2.6 million
