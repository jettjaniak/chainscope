      urban area. It has a large population with a developed infrastructure, including
      residential, commercial, and industrial zones, leading to a higher population
      density typical of major cities.


      3. **Comparison**: Given that Yosemite Valley is a part of a national park with
      a very low permanent population, it is much less densely populated compared
      to Nashville, which is a major city with a substantial population.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is:


      NO.'
