      1. First, locate London Bridge station:

      - London Bridge station is in London, United Kingdom

      - London is in the western part of Europe


      2. Next, locate Milan Cathedral:

      - Milan Cathedral is in Milan, Italy

      - Milan is in northern Italy, in the southern part of Europe


      3. Consider their relative geographic positions:

      - London is west of Milan

      - This means London Bridge station is also west of Milan Cathedral


      4. The question asks if London Bridge station is east of Milan Cathedral

      - Since London is west of Milan, London Bridge station is NOT east of Milan
      Cathedral


      5. Therefore, the answer is:


      NO'
    f588117b-eb60-4ba1-a5b9-50ef71ee17c2: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate London Bridge station:

      - London Bridge station is in London, United Kingdom

      - London is located in western Europe, specifically in the northwest of the
      continent


      2. Next, locate Milan Cathedral:

      - Milan Cathedral (Duomo di Milano) is in Milan, Italy

      - Milan is located in northern Italy, in the southern part of Europe


      3. Consider their relative geographic positions:

      - London is west of Milan

      - This means that any location in London (like London Bridge station) will be
      west of Milan Cathedral


      4. Interpreting "east of":

      - If something is west of another location, it is NOT east of that location


      5. Conclusion:

      - London Bridge station is west of Milan Cathedral, not east of it


      Therefore, the answer is: NO.'
