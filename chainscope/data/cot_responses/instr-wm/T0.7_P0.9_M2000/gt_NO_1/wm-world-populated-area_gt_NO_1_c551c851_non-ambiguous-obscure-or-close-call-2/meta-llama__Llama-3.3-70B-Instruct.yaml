      has a larger area than London, we first need to know the areas of both cities.


      1. **Identify the area of Lisbon**: The area of Lisbon, the capital of Portugal,
      is approximately 100.05 square kilometers (38.6 square miles).


      2. **Identify the area of London**: The area of London, the capital of England,
      is significantly larger. The Greater London area covers about 1,579 square kilometers
      (610 square miles).


      3. **Compare the areas**: Comparing the two, Lisbon has an area of about 100
      square kilometers, while London has an area of about 1,579 square kilometers.


      Given these steps, it''s clear that London has a much larger area than Lisbon.


      The answer is: NO'

      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the areas of Lisbon and London**: First, we need to know the exact
      areas of both cities to compare them. The area of a city can be defined in different
      ways (e.g., urban area, metropolitan area), but for simplicity, let''s consider
      the administrative or municipal area.


      2. **Lisbon''s area**: Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, has a municipal area.
      According to various sources, the area of Lisbon is approximately 100.05 square
      kilometers (38.63 square miles).


      3. **London''s area**: London, the capital of England, is a larger city. The
      Greater London area, which is the administrative area of London, covers about
      1,579 square kilometers (610 square miles). However, if we''re comparing municipal
      areas directly, we need to consider the City of London and the surrounding metropolitan
      area differently. The City of London itself is very small, about 2.9 square
      kilometers (1.1 square miles), but this is not what people usually refer to
      when talking about London''s size. The Greater London Authority area is what
      most people consider as "London" in terms of its administrative and functional
      area.


      4. **Comparison**: To compare the two cities fairly, we should consider the
      administrative or metropolitan areas that are commonly used to define each city''s
      size. Lisbon''s municipal area is about 100 square kilometers, while London''s
      area, when considering Greater London, is significantly larger, at 1,579 square
      kilometers.


      Given these steps and the comparison, the answer to whether Lisbon has a larger
      area than London is clearly **NO**.'

      (6.5 to 7.8 square kilometers), though the precise area can depend on how one
      defines its boundaries.


      4. **Determine the area of Pyongyang**: Pyongyang covers a much larger area.
      The city''s metropolitan area is approximately 3,190 square kilometers (1,231
      square miles).


      5. **Compare the areas**: Given the significant difference in size, with Pyongyang
      covering an area hundreds of times larger than the Upper West Side, it''s clear
      that Pyongyang has a much larger area than the Upper West Side.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Does Upper West Side have a larger area
      than Pyongyang?" is **NO**.'

      we need to compare the areas of the Upper West Side in New York City and Pyongyang,
      the capital of North Korea.


      1. **Identify the Upper West Side**: The Upper West Side is a neighborhood in
      the borough of Manhattan in New York City. It is bounded by Central Park to
      the east, the Hudson River to the west, West 59th Street to the south, and West
      125th Street to the north.


      2. **Determine the area of the Upper West Side**: The area of the Upper West
      Side can vary slightly depending on how its boundaries are defined, but it generally
      covers about 2.5 square miles (approximately 6.5 square kilometers).


      3. **Identify Pyongyang**: Pyongyang is the capital and largest city of North
      Korea. It is a significant urban center with a much larger area compared to
      a neighborhood like the Upper West Side.


      4. **Determine the area of Pyongyang**: The metropolitan area of Pyongyang covers
      approximately 3,237 square kilometers (1,250 square miles). However, the city
      proper (the urban area) is significantly smaller, but still much larger than
      the Upper West Side, covering about 470 square kilometers (182 square miles).


      5. **Compare the areas**: Given that the Upper West Side covers about 6.5 square
      kilometers and Pyongyang''s urban area covers about 470 square kilometers, Pyongyang
      is significantly larger.


      Based on this comparison, the answer to whether the Upper West Side has a larger
      area than Pyongyang is **NO**.'

      by the ROC, has a total area of about 36,197 square kilometers (13,974 square
      miles).


      3. Comparing the areas: Easter Island has an area of approximately 163.6 square
      kilometers, while the island of Taiwan (which encompasses the area that might

      (Cairo) has a larger area than the Province of Barcelona, let''s first identify
      the areas of both.


      1. **Cairo**: Cairo, the capital city of Egypt, has a metropolitan area. However,
      when referring to "El Cairo," it''s often about the city proper or the greater
      metropolitan area. The city proper of Cairo has an area of approximately 308
      square kilometers (119 square miles), but the Greater Cairo metropolitan area
      covers about 3,085 square kilometers (1,191 square miles).


      2. **Province of Barcelona**: The Province of Barcelona is one of the four provinces
      of Catalonia, Spain. It has a total area of about 7,733 square kilometers (2,985
      square miles).


      Now, comparing the areas:

      - The city proper of Cairo is significantly smaller than the Province of Barcelona.

      - Even the Greater Cairo metropolitan area is smaller than the Province of Barcelona.


      Given these comparisons, the answer to whether El Cairo has a larger area than

      directly associated with the Nile, we''ll consider it as a geographical region
      around the Nile River.


      3. **Determine the Area of Capri**: The island of Capri has a total area of
      approximately 10.36 square kilometers (4.00 square miles).


      4. **Determine the Area of the Nile State or Region**: If we consider the Nile
      State in Sudan, it has a much larger area compared to Capri, covering about
      122,123 square kilometers (47,144 square miles). However, if we''re talking
      about the length of the Nile River itself, it''s about 6,695 kilometers (4,160
      miles) long but only a few kilometers wide. The question seems to refer to a
      "state," so we''ll assume it''s asking about a region or state named after the
      Nile, not the river''s length.


      Given these steps, it''s clear that the area of any state or region named after
      the Nile River (like the Nile State in Sudan) would be significantly larger
      than the island of Capri.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Capri has a larger area than the River Nile
      (state) is: **NO**'

      \ or simply considering the area influenced by the Nile, but since the question\
      \ is about size comparison, we'll consider the area directly associated with\

      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify Capri**: Capri is an island located in the Gulf of Naples, Italy.
      It''s known for its beautiful landscapes and is a popular tourist destination.


      2. **Identify River Nile (state)**: The question seems to be referring to a
      "state" related to the River Nile. Given the context, it''s reasonable to interpret
      this as the Nile River itself or a region directly associated with it. However,
      without a specific "Nile State" that is widely recognized, we might consider
      the areas or regions through which the Nile River flows, such as Egyptian Nile
      River Valley, or more broadly, countries through which the Nile flows like Egypt,
      Sudan, and South Sudan. For the sake of comparison, we''ll consider the general
      area influenced by the Nile River.


      3. **Determine the Area of Capri**: The island of Capri has a total area of
      approximately 10.4 square kilometers (about 4 square miles).


      4. **Determine the Area Influenced by the Nile River**: The Nile River itself
      is approximately 6,695 kilometers (4,160 miles) long, but its basin covers about
      3,400,000 square kilometers (1,312,747 square miles). Even if we consider just
      the area directly along the river and its delta, this would still be vastly
      larger than the island of Capri.


      5. **Compare the Areas**: Given the enormous difference in size, with Capri
      being about 10.4 square kilometers and the area influenced by the Nile River
      being millions of square kilometers, it''s clear that Capri is much, much smaller
      than the area associated with the Nile River.


      Based on this analysis, the answer to whether Capri has a larger area than the
      area associated with the River Nile (state) is: **NO**.'

      2. **Identify River Nile (state)**: The question seems to refer to a state or

      a state but a river that flows through several countries in northeastern Africa,
      including Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia. If we''re considering a "state" related
      to the River Nile, we might be looking at something like the Nile River State

      District and Ankara.

      2. **Gangnam District Area**: Gangnam District is a district in Seoul, South
      Korea. According to various sources, Gangnam District has an area of approximately
      39.5 square kilometers (15.3 square miles).

      3. **Ankara Area**: Ankara is the capital city of Turkey. The area of Ankara
      Province is large, covering about 24,522 square kilometers (9,468 square miles).
      However, when comparing urban or city areas, we should consider the metropolitan
      area or the city proper of Ankara, which is significantly smaller than the province.
      The city proper of Ankara covers an area of about 1,970 square kilometers (761
      square miles).

      39.5 square kilometers) to the area of Ankara city proper (approximately 1,970
      square kilometers), it''s clear that Gangnam District has a much smaller area
      than the city of Ankara.

      It is known for its amusement parks and beach.


      2. **Identify Bavaria**: Bavaria is a state located in the southeastern part
      of Germany. It is the largest state in Germany by land area and has a rich history
      and culture.


      3. **Determine the Area of Coney Island**: The area of Coney Island is relatively
      small. While the exact boundaries can be somewhat ambiguous, it generally encompasses
      about 1.79 square miles (4.64 square kilometers) of land area.


      4. **Determine the Area of Bavaria**: Bavaria covers a significant portion of
      southern Germany, with an area of approximately 70,548 square kilometers (27,200

      1. **Find the area of Berlin, Germany**: Berlin covers an area of approximately
      892 square kilometers (344.4 square miles).


      2. **Find the area of Los Angeles County, California**: Los Angeles County covers
      an area of approximately 10,570 square kilometers (4,083 square miles).


      3. **Compare the areas**: Now, we compare the area of Berlin (892 square kilometers)
      with the area of Los Angeles County (10,570 square kilometers).


      Since 892 square kilometers (the area of Berlin) is less than 10,570 square
      kilometers (the area of Los Angeles County), Berlin does not have a larger area
      than Los Angeles County, California.

      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the areas in question**: We are comparing the area of SoHo, Manhattan,
      with the area of Holland. SoHo is a neighborhood in Lower Manhattan, New York
      City, while Holland refers to the Netherlands, a country in Northwestern Europe.
      However, it''s worth noting that "Holland" can sometimes colloquially refer
      to the Netherlands as a whole, though technically, Holland refers to two of
      the twelve provinces of the Netherlands: North Holland and South Holland.


      2. **Determine the area of SoHo, Manhattan**: SoHo is relatively small. It is
      bounded by Houston Street on the north, Canal Street on the south, Crosby Street
      on the east, and Sixth Avenue on the west. The exact area can vary slightly
      depending on how one defines its borders, but it is roughly 0.87 square kilometers
      (0.336 square miles).


      3. **Determine the area of Holland**: If we consider "Holland" to refer to the
      two provinces of North Holland and South Holland in the Netherlands, their combined
      area is significantly larger than SoHo. North Holland has an area of about 2,670
      square kilometers (1,031 square miles), and South Holland has an area of about
      3,403 square kilometers (1,314 square miles), totaling approximately 6,073 square
      kilometers (2,345 square miles). However, if we consider "Holland" to colloquially
      mean the entire country of the Netherlands, the total area would be about 41,543
      square kilometers (16,039 square miles).


      4. **Compare the areas**: Given the smallest interpretation of Holland (the
      two provinces of North and South Holland), it is clear that SoHo, Manhattan,
      has a much smaller area than Holland. Even the smallest possible interpretation
      of Holland''s area (just the two provinces) is many times larger than SoHo.


      Based on this analysis, the answer to whether SoHo, Manhattan, has a larger
      area than Holland is **NO**.'

      we need to determine the area of Punta Cana and the Community of Madrid, and
      then compare them.


      1. **Identify Punta Cana**: Punta Cana is a region located at the easternmost
      tip of the Dominican Republic. It is known for its beaches and resorts. However,
      Punta Cana itself is not a large administrative division like a province or
      a state but rather a specific area within the province of La Altagracia, in
      the Dominican Republic.


      2. **Area of Punta Cana**: The exact area of Punta Cana is not as clearly defined
      as that of administrative regions because it''s more of a tourist and geographical
      designation. However, the entire province of La Altagracia, where Punta Cana
      is located, covers approximately 3,010 square kilometers (1,162 square miles).


      3. **Identify the Community of Madrid**: The Community of Madrid is an autonomous
      community in Spain, serving as the capital and largest city of Spain, Madrid,
      and its surrounding metropolitan area.


      4. **Area of the Community of Madrid**: The Community of Madrid covers an area
      of approximately 8,028 square kilometers (3,100 square miles).


      5. **Comparison**: Comparing the areas, the Community of Madrid (approximately
      8,028 square kilometers) is larger than the province of La Altagracia (approximately
      3,010 square kilometers), where Punta Cana is located.


      Given these steps, since Punta Cana''s area is not explicitly defined but is
      part of a larger area (La Altagracia) that is smaller than the Community of
      Madrid, the answer to whether Punta Cana has a larger area than the Community
