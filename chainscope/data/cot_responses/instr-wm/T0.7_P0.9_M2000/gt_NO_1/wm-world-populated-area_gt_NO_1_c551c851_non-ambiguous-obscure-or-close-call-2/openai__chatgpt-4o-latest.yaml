      Step 1: Understand what "Central Area, Singapore" refers to.

      - The Central Area is the central business district (CBD) and surrounding urban
      planning area in Singapore. It is a relatively small region within the city-state.


      Step 2: Determine the area of Central Area, Singapore.

      - The Central Area of Singapore covers approximately 13.1 square kilometers.


      Step 3: Understand what "Tokyo" refers to.

      - "Tokyo" can refer to different administrative levels, but generally, it refers
      to Tokyo Metropolis, which includes 23 special wards and other areas.


      Step 4: Determine the area of Tokyo.

      - Tokyo Metropolis covers approximately 2,194 square kilometers.


      Step 5: Compare the two areas.

      - 13.1 square kilometers (Central Area, Singapore) vs. 2,194 square kilometers
