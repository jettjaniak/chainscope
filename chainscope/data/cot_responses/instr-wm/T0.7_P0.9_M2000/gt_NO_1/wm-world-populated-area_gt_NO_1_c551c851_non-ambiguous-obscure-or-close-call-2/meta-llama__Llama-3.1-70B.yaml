      1. **Identify Casablanca**: Casablanca is a city located in Morocco, North Africa.
      It is the largest city in Morocco and serves as the country''s economic and
      cultural hub.


      2. **Identify the Emirate of Dubai**: The Emirate of Dubai is one of the seven
      emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It is located on the Persian
      Gulf coast of the Arabian Peninsula and is known for its modern architecture
      and thriving economy.


      3. **Determine the area of Casablanca**: According to various sources, Casablanca
      covers an area of approximately 220 square kilometers (85 square miles). It
      is a relatively large city, but it''s essential to compare it with the Emirate
      of Dubai.


      4. **Determine the area of the Emirate of Dubai**: The Emirate of Dubai covers
      a significantly larger area. It spans approximately 4,114 square kilometers
      (1,588 square miles), making it one of the largest emirates in the UAE.


      5. **Compare the areas**: Comparing the two, Casablanca has an area of approximately
      220 square kilometers, while the Emirate of Dubai has an area of about 4,114
      square kilometers.


      Given the substantial difference in size, with the Emirate of Dubai being much

      than the Emirate of Dubai.

      Stockholm urban area has a larger area than Normandy, let''s break down the
      information step by step:


      1. **Identify the Stockholm urban area**: The Stockholm urban area is the metropolitan
      area surrounding the city of Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. It includes the
      city of Stockholm and its surrounding municipalities.


      2. **Identify Normandy**: Normandy is a region in northern France, known for
      its rich history, including the D-Day landings during World War II. It is made
      up of multiple departments, including Calvados, Eure, Manche, Orne, and Seine-Maritime.


      3. **Determine the area of the Stockholm urban area**: The exact boundaries
      of the Stockholm urban area can vary depending on the definition, but it generally
      includes the city of Stockholm and its surrounding municipalities. According
      to the European Union''s statistical office (Eurostat), the Stockholm metropolitan
      region (which includes the city and its surrounding municipalities) covers an
      area of approximately 6,519 square kilometers (2,517 square miles).


      4. **Determine the area of Normandy**: Normandy covers a much larger area. The
      region of Normandy is approximately 29,907 square kilometers (11,547 square
      miles) in size, making it significantly larger than the Stockholm urban area.


      5. **Compare the areas**: Given the significant difference in size, with Normandy
      being much larger than the Stockholm urban area, it''s clear that Normandy has
      a much larger area than the Stockholm urban area.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Does Stockholm urban area have a larger
      area than Normandy?" is **NO**'

      Island has a larger area than Taiwan Province, People''s Republic of China,
      we need to compare their respective areas.


      1. **Identify Easter Island**: Easter Island, also known as Rapa Nui, is a remote
      volcanic island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. It is a special territory
      of Chile.


      2. **Identify Taiwan Province, People''s Republic of China**: Taiwan Province
      is a province of the People''s Republic of China (PRC). It is not to be confused
      with the Republic of China (ROC), which also claims Taiwan. The PRC''s Taiwan
      Province refers to the mainland portion of China that was formerly part of the
      Republic of China before the ROC government retreated to Taiwan in 1949.


      3. **Determine the Area of Easter Island**: Easter Island has an area of approximately
      164 square kilometers (63 square miles).


      4. **Determine the Area of Taiwan Province, People''s Republic of China**: Taiwan
      Province, PRC, covers a significant portion of mainland China. It has an area
      of approximately 9.6 million square kilometers (3.7 million square miles).


      5. **Compare the Areas**: Comparing the two, Easter Island has an area of approximately
      164 square kilometers, while Taiwan Province, PRC, covers 9.6 million square
      kilometers.


      Given the vast difference in size, with Taiwan Province, PRC, being much larger,
      it''s clear that Easter Island does not have a larger area than Taiwan Province,
      People''s Republic of China.

      Republic of Crimea has a larger area than Ireland, let''s follow a step-by-step
      process:


      1. **Identify the Republic of Crimea**: The Republic of Crimea is a disputed
      territory located on the Crimean Peninsula in Eastern Europe. It is recognized
      as part of Ukraine by most of the international community, but it is currently
      under the de facto control of the Russian Federation.


      2. **Identify Ireland**: Ireland is an island located in the North Atlantic
      Ocean, west of Great Britain. It is divided into two parts: the Republic of
      Ireland, which is a sovereign state, and Northern Ireland, which is part of
      the United Kingdom.


      3. **Determine the area of the Republic of Crimea**: The Republic of Crimea
      covers an area of approximately 26,081 square kilometers (10,070 square miles).


      4. **Determine the area of Ireland**: The total area of Ireland, including both
      the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, is approximately 84,421 square
      kilometers (32,595 square miles).


      5. **Compare the areas**: Comparing the two areas, it''s clear that Ireland
      has a significantly larger area than the Republic of Crimea.


      Therefore, the answer to the question "Does the Republic of Crimea have a larger
      area than Ireland?" is **NO**'
