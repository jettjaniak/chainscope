    0c0a2111-b527-41ac-beb8-c2e1eb403d5c: 'To determine whether the
      Stockholm urban area has a larger area than Normandy, let''s break down the
      information step by step:


      1. **Identify the Stockholm urban area**: The Stockholm urban area is the metropolitan
      area surrounding the city of Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. It includes the
      city of Stockholm and its surrounding municipalities.


      2. **Identify Normandy**: Normandy is a region in northern France, known for
      its rich history, including the D-Day landings during World War II. It is made
      up of multiple departments, including Calvados, Eure, Manche, Orne, and Seine-Maritime.


      3. **Determine the area of the Stockholm urban area**: The exact boundaries
      of the Stockholm urban area can vary depending on the definition, but it generally
      includes the city of Stockholm and its surrounding municipalities. According
      to the European Union''s statistical office (Eurostat), the Stockholm metropolitan
      region (which includes the city and its surrounding municipalities) covers an
      area of approximately 6,519 square kilometers (2,517 square miles).


      4. **Determine the area of Normandy**: Normandy covers a much larger area. The
      region of Normandy is approximately 29,907 square kilometers (11,547 square
      miles) in size, making it significantly larger than the Stockholm urban area.


      5. **Compare the areas**: Given the significant difference in size, with Normandy
      being much larger than the Stockholm urban area, it''s clear that Normandy has
      a much larger area than the Stockholm urban area.

    1bc50d12-fd33-4798-bf82-4985d3959436: 'To determine whether Easter
      Island has a larger area than Taiwan Province, People''s Republic of China,
      we need to compare their respective areas.


      1. **Identify Easter Island**: Easter Island, also known as Rapa Nui, is a remote
      volcanic island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. It is a special territory
      of Chile.


      2. **Identify Taiwan Province, People''s Republic of China**: Taiwan Province
      is a province of the People''s Republic of China (PRC). It is not to be confused
      with the Republic of China (ROC), which also claims Taiwan. The PRC''s Taiwan
      Province refers to the mainland portion of China that was formerly part of the
      Republic of China before the ROC government retreated to Taiwan in 1949.


      3. **Determine the Area of Easter Island**: Easter Island has an area of approximately
      164 square kilometers (63 square miles).


      4. **Determine the Area of Taiwan Province, People''s Republic of China**: Taiwan
      Province, PRC, covers a significant portion of mainland China. It has an area
      of approximately 9.6 million square kilometers (3.7 million square miles).


      5. **Compare the Areas**: Comparing the two, Easter Island has an area of approximately
      164 square kilometers, while Taiwan Province, PRC, covers 9.6 million square
      kilometers.

      the seven Canary Islands. It is located in the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast
      of Africa, and is part of Spain.


      2. **Identify Great Britain**: Great Britain is an island located off the northwest
      coast of continental Europe. It is the largest island in the British Isles and
      includes England, Scotland, and Wales.


      3. **Determine the area of Tenerife**: Tenerife has an area of approximately
      2,034 square kilometers (785 square miles).


      4. **Determine the area of Great Britain**: Great Britain has an area of approximately
      209,331 square kilometers (80,823 square miles).


      5. **Compare the areas**: Comparing the two areas, it''s clear that Great Britain
