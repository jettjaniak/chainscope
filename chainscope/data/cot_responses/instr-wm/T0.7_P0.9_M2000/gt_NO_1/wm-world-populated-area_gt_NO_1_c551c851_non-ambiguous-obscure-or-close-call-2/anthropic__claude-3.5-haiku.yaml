      1. First, let''s identify the locations:

      - Machupicchu District is located in Peru, near the famous Inca archaeological
      site

      - Bangkok is the capital city of Thailand


      2. Check the areas:

      - Machupicchu District is a small district in the Cusco Region of Peru

      - Bangkok is a large metropolitan area covering 1,568.7 square kilometers


      3. Research the area of Machupicchu District:

      - The Machupicchu District has an area of approximately 370 square kilometers


      4. Compare the areas:

      - Machupicchu District: 370 sq km

      - Bangkok: 1,568.7 sq km


      5. Determine which is larger:

      - Bangkok is significantly larger than Machupicchu District

      - Tenerife is an island in the Canary Islands (Spain)

      - Great Britain is a large island comprising England, Scotland, and Wales


      2. Area of Tenerife:

      - Tenerife is approximately 2,034 square kilometers


      3. Area of Great Britain:

      - Great Britain has an area of about 218,600 square kilometers
