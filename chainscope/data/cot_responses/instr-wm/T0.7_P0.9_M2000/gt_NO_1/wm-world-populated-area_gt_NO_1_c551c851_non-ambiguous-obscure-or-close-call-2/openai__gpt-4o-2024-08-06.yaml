      area than Greater Orlando, we need to compare the sizes of these two regions.


      1. **Understand the area of Mecca**: Mecca is a city in Saudi Arabia and is
      part of the Makkah Province. The city itself is relatively small in terms of
      land area. It is an important religious site, but its urban area is not particularly
      large compared to some other cities around the world.


      2. **Understand the area of Greater Orlando**: Greater Orlando, often referred
      to as the Orlando metropolitan area, includes the city of Orlando and the surrounding
      areas in Central Florida. It covers multiple counties and has a much larger
      land area than just the city of Orlando itself.


      3. **Comparison**: Generally, metropolitan areas in the United States, like
      Greater Orlando, tend to cover large expanses of land as they include not only
      the central city but also suburban and sometimes rural areas. In contrast, Mecca,
      while significant in religious and cultural terms, does not cover as extensive
      a land area.


      Based on these considerations, Greater Orlando is likely to have a larger area
