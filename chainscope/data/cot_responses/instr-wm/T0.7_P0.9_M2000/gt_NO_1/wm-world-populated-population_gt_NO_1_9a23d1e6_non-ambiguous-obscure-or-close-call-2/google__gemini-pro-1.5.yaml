      * **Step 3: Frame the comparison.** We need to compare the population of a city
      (Luxor) with the population of an archipelago (Canary Islands).

      * **Step 4: General knowledge/lookup.**  Cities tend to have smaller populations
      than island groups, especially well-populated ones like the Canary Islands.  A
      quick search confirms this. Luxor''s population is in the hundreds of thousands,
      while the Canary Islands'' population is over two million.
