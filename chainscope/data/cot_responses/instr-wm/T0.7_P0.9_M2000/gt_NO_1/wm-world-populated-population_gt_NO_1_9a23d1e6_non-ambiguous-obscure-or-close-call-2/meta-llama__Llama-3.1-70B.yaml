      more populous than Moscow, let''s break down the steps to find the answer:


      1. **Identify the Population of Casablanca, Havana**: Casablanca is a neighborhood
      in Havana, Cuba. As of my last update, the population of Casablanca is approximately
      15,000 to 20,000 people.


      2. **Identify the Population of Moscow**: Moscow is the capital and largest
      city of Russia. As of my last update, the population of Moscow is about 12.5
      million people.


      3. **Compare the Populations**: Now, we compare the population of Casablanca,
      Havana (approximately 15,000 to 20,000) with the population of Moscow (approximately
      12.5 million).


      Based on these numbers, Casablanca has a population of about 15,000 to 20,000,

      Based on these numbers, the City of Sydney has a population of about 210,000,
      while the Stockholm urban area has a population of about 1,515,017. Since 210,000

      surrounding municipalities. The population of the Stockholm urban area is around
      1.5 million people.


      3. **Compare the Populations**: Now, we compare the population of the City of
      Sydney (approximately 250,000) with the population of the Stockholm urban area
      (approximately 1.5 million).


      Based on the comparison, it''s clear that the Stockholm urban area has a significantly

      the population of the Community of Madrid with the population of Mainland Australia.
      Here are the steps to consider:


      1. **Identify the Population of Community of Madrid**: The Community of Madrid
      is an autonomous community in Spain. As of my last update, the population of
      the Community of Madrid is approximately 6.7 million people.


      2. **Identify the Population of Mainland Australia**: Mainland Australia refers
      to the continental mainland of Australia, excluding external territories. The
      population of Mainland Australia is about 25 million people, based on recent

      3. **Compare the Populations**: Now, we compare the population of Copenhagen
      (approximately 633,000) with that of Budapest (approximately 1.75 million).


      Based on these numbers, Copenhagen has a population of about 633,000, while
      Budapest has a population of about 1.75 million. Since 633,000 is less than
      1.75 million, Copenhagen is less populous than Budapest.


      The answer is: **NO**'

      1. **Identify the Population of the River Nile (state)**: The River Nile (state)
      is a state in Northern Sudan. As of my last update, the population of the River
      Nile (state) is approximately 1.7 million people.


      2. **Identify the Population of Punjab**: Punjab is a state in India. As of
      the 2011 census, the population of Punjab was approximately 27.7 million people.
      Note that this number may have changed since the last census.


      3. **Compare the Populations**: Now, we compare the population of the River
      Nile (state) (approximately 1.7 million) with the population of Punjab (approximately
      27.7 million).


      Based on these numbers, the River Nile (state) has a population of about 1.7
      million, while Punjab has a population of about 27.7 million. Since 1.7 million
      is less than 27.7 million, the River Nile (state) is less populous than Punjab.


      The answer is: **NO**'
