      of Sydney is more populous than the Stockholm urban area, let''s break down
      the steps to find the answer:


      1. **Identify the Population of City of Sydney**: The City of Sydney is a local
      government area in New South Wales, Australia. As of my last update, the population
      of the City of Sydney is approximately 210,000 people.


      2. **Identify the Population of Stockholm urban area**: Stockholm urban area
      is the urban area of Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. As of my last update,
      the population of the Stockholm urban area is about 1,515,017 people.


      3. **Compare the Populations**: Now, we compare the population of the City of
      Sydney (approximately 210,000) with the population of the Stockholm urban area
      (approximately 1,515,017).


      Based on these numbers, the City of Sydney has a population of about 210,000,
      while the Stockholm urban area has a population of about 1,515,017. Since 210,000

      of Suez Governorate.


      2. **Identify Transylvania**: Transylvania is a historical region located in
      central Romania. It is not a political entity and does not have a specific population
      figure.


      3. **Compare Populations**: To compare the populations, we need to consider
      the population of Suez and the population of the region of Transylvania.


      4. **Population of Suez**: As of my last update, the population of Suez was
      around 750,000 people.

      the answer:


      1. **Identify the Population of the River Nile (state)**: The River Nile (state)
      is a state in Northern Sudan. As of my last update, the population of the River
