      1. First, I''ll find the population of Sydney urban area:

      - Sydney urban area population is approximately 5.3 million people (as of 2021)


      2. Next, I''ll find the population of Stockholm urban area:

      - Stockholm urban area population is approximately 2.4 million people (as of
