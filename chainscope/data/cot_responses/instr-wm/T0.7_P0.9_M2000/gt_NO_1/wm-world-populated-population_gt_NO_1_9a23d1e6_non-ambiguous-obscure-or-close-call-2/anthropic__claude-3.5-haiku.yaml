      1. First, I''ll find the population of Sydney urban area:

      - Sydney urban area population is approximately 5.3 million people (as of 2021)


      2. Next, I''ll find the population of Stockholm urban area:

      - Stockholm urban area population is approximately 2.4 million people (as of

      3. Compare the two populations:

      - Sydney (5.3 million) is significantly larger than Stockholm (2.4 million)


      4. Conclusion:

      Since Sydney''s urban population is more than twice that of Stockholm, Sydney
      is more populous.
