      - Brussels (the city proper) has around 185,000 people

      - The Brussels-Capital Region has about 1.2 million people

      - The greater Brussels metropolitan area has about 2.5 million people

      6.5 million people

      - If we mean the Netherlands (which is sometimes incorrectly called Holland),
      it has about 17.4 million people
