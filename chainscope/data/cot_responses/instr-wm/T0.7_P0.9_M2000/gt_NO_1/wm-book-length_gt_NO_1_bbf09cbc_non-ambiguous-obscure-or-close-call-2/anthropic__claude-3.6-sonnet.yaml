      - The Shadow Rising (Book 4 of The Wheel of Time) has approximately 1,007 pages


      3. Now I can compare:

      - In Cold Blood: 343 pages

      2. Now for Mockingjay:

      - It''s the third book in The Hunger Games trilogy

      - It''s a full-length young adult novel

      - Like most books in this genre, it has several hundred pages

      - Specifically, Mockingjay has approximately 390 pages

      1. Let me recall the formats of both books:

      - "Where''s Wally? The Fantastic Journey" is a large-format picture book with
      typically around 24-32 pages

      - "Mockingjay" is a novel, the third book in The Hunger Games trilogy, with

      2. Picture books like Where''s Wally? are designed to be shorter, focusing on
      detailed illustrations on each page

      - They usually have a limited number of scenes/spreads

      - Each spread is meant to be studied in detail


      3. Mockingjay, being a young adult novel, is much longer

      - It''s a text-heavy book with a complete narrative

      - Like most novels in its genre, it has hundreds of pages


      4. Comparing the two:

      1. First, I need to clarify that Steven Levitt''s book is actually called "Freakonomics:
      A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything"


      2. "The Dark Tower" by Stephen King is actually a series of 8 books, not a single
      book. If we''re comparing to the entire series, that would be very different
      than comparing to just one book in the series.


      3. Freakonomics is around 320 pages.


      4. The complete Dark Tower series is over 4,000 pages total. Even any single
      book in the series tends to be 400-800 pages.


      5. Therefore, whether we compare to a single Dark Tower book or the entire series,
      The Dark Tower has more pages.


      NO'

      1. First, I need to correct a small error in the question - Steven Levitt''s
      book is called "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of
      Everything"


      2. "The Dark Tower" by Stephen King is actually a series of 8 books, not a single
      book. If we''re comparing to the entire series, that would be thousands of pages.


      3. Freakonomics is a single book that''s approximately 320 pages long.


      4. Even just one book in The Dark Tower series is longer than Freakonomics.
      For example, The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower is about 845 pages.


      5. The entire Dark Tower series is well over 4,000 pages.


      Therefore: NO, Freakonomics does not have more pages than The Dark Tower.'

      1. Let me recall the page counts of these books:

      - Artemis Fowl (first book) is around 280-300 pages depending on the edition

      - The God Delusion is approximately 400 pages


      2. Since The God Delusion has about 400 pages and Artemis Fowl has about 280-300
      pages, The God Delusion is clearly longer.


      3. Therefore, Artemis Fowl does NOT have more pages than The God Delusion.


      NO'

      1. Let me recall the page counts for both books:

      - Artemis Fowl (first book) is approximately 280-300 pages depending on the
      edition

      - The God Delusion is approximately 400 pages in most editions


      2. Since The God Delusion has about 400 pages and Artemis Fowl has about 280-300
      pages, The God Delusion is longer.


      3. Therefore, Artemis Fowl does NOT have more pages than The God Delusion.

      1. First, let me recall the page counts of both books:

      - Artemis Fowl (first book) is approximately 280 pages

      - The God Delusion is approximately 420 pages


      2. Comparing the numbers:

      280 < 420


      3. Therefore, Artemis Fowl has fewer pages than The God Delusion

      3. The question asks if Artemis Fowl has MORE pages than The God Delusion, not
      less.


      Therefore, since Artemis Fowl has fewer pages than The God Delusion, the answer
      is:
