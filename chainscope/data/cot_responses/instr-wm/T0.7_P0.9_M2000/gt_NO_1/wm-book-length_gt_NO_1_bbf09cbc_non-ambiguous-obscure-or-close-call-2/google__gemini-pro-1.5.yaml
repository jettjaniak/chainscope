      It My Way*.

      * **Step 4:** Compare the two page counts.


      *Push* is a relatively short novel.  Autobiographies, especially of famous sports
      figures, tend to be quite long.  Therefore, it''s likely *Playing It My Way*
      has more pages.

      is reported to be over 600 pages.

      James and the Giant Peach is a children''s book, likely shorter than The Immortal

      3. **Answer the question:** Based on the comparison, we can answer YES or NO.


      *Coraline* is a relatively short novel, typically around 200 pages. *Freakonomics*
      (which I assume is meant, as Stephen Dubner hasn''t written a book called *The
      Hidden Side of Everything* though he co-authored *Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist
      Explores the Hidden Side of Everything*) has varying lengths depending on the
      edition, but it''s generally over 250 pages.


      Therefore, the answer is NO.
