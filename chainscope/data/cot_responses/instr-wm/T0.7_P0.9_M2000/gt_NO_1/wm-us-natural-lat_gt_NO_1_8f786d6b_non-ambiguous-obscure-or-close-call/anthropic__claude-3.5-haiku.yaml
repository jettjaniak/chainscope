      1. First, let''s recall the locations of Lake Erie and Lake Michigan in the
      United States.


      2. Lake Erie is located in the northeastern part of the United States, bordering
      Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and Michigan.


      3. Lake Michigan is located in the upper Midwestern United States, primarily
      bordering Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana.


      4. Looking at a map of the Great Lakes, Lake Michigan is positioned more to
      the west and northwest.


      5. Lake Erie is positioned more to the east and southeast of Lake Michigan.


      6. Therefore, Lake Erie is actually located SOUTH of Lake Michigan, not north.
