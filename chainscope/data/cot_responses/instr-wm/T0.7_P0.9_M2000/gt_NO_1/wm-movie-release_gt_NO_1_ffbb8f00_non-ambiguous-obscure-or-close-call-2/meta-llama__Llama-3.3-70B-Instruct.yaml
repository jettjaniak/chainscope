      Ford Coppola''s The Godfather was released later than Will Ferrell''s Anchorman,
      let''s consider the release dates of both films.


      1. The Godfather, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is a classic film released
      in 1972.

      2. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, starring Will Ferrell, was released
      in 2004.


      Given that 1972 is before 2004, we can conclude that The Godfather was released
      earlier than Anchorman.


      So, the answer to whether The Godfather was released later than Anchorman is:
      NO.'

      let''s break down the steps needed:


      1. **Identify the Release Years**: The first step is to identify the release
      years of both movies. Ramesh Sippy''s "Seeta Aur Geeta" and Prakash Mehra''s
      "Muqaddar Ka Sikandar" are the films in question.


      2. **Seeta Aur Geeta''s Release Year**: "Seeta Aur Geeta" was released in 1972.


      3. **Muqaddar Ka Sikandar''s Release Year**: "Muqaddar Ka Sikandar" was released
      in 1978.


      4. **Comparison**: Now, we compare the release years to determine which film
      was released later. "Seeta Aur Geeta" (1972) was released before "Muqaddar Ka
      Sikandar" (1978).


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that "Seeta Aur Geeta" was released in 1972 and "Muqaddar
      Ka Sikandar" in 1978, it''s clear that "Seeta Aur Geeta" was released earlier
      than "Muqaddar Ka Sikandar".


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Ramesh Sippy''s "Seeta Aur Geeta"
      was released later than Prakash Mehra''s "Muqaddar Ka Sikandar" is:


      NO'

      1. **Shakti Samanta''s Aradhana**: This is a Bollywood film released in 1969.

      2. **Takashi Shimizu''s The Grudge (Ju-On: The Grudge)**: This is a Japanese

      Shimizu, as part of the Ju-On series which began in 1998 with direct-to-video
      films.


      Given these release years:


      - Aradhana was released in 1969.

      - The Grudge, as directed by Takashi Shimizu, was released in 2002.


      Since 1969 is before 2002, Aradhana was released earlier than The Grudge.
