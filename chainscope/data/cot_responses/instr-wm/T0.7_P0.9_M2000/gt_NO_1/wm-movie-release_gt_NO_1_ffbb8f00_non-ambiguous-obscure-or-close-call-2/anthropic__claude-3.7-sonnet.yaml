      "The Godfather" was released later than Will Ferrell''s "Anchorman," I need
      to identify when each film was released.


      Step 1: Identify when "The Godfather" was released.

      "The Godfather" directed by Francis Ford Coppola was released in 1972.


      Step 2: Identify when "Anchorman" (full title: "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron
      Burgundy") was released.

      "Anchorman" starring Will Ferrell was released in 2004.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      1972 comes before 2004, with a difference of about 32 years.


      Therefore, "The Godfather" was released earlier than "Anchorman," not later.
