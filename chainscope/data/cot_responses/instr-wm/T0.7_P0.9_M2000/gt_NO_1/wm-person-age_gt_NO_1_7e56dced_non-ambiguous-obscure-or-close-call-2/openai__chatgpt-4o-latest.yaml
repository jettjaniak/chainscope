      - From August 24, 1929 to August 24, 2004 = 75 years

      - From August 24, 2004 to November 11, 2004 = about 2.5 additional months


      So, Yasser Arafat was 75 years old when he died.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages**

      - Tupac: 25 years old

      - Arafat: 75 years old


      Since 25 < 75, Tupac Shakur was NOT older than Yasser Arafat at their times
      of death.

      To calculate her age at death:

      - From 1830 to 1886 is 56 years.

      - Since she died in May and was born in December, she did not reach her 56th

    82bf4996-b02d-49ab-ae21-e4ff82d67577: 'To determine whether Lyndon B. Johnson
      was older at the time of his death than Andrew Jackson, we need to look at the
      birth and death dates of both individuals and calculate their ages at death.


      **Step 1: Find Lyndon B. Johnson''s birth and death dates**

      - Born: August 27, 1908

      - Died: January 22, 1973


      Now calculate his age at death:

      - From August 27, 1908, to August 27, 1972 = 64 years

      - From August 27, 1972, to January 22, 1973 = almost 5 months


      So Lyndon B. Johnson was 64 years and almost 5 months old when he died.


      **Step 2: Find Andrew Jackson''s birth and death dates**

      - Born: March 15, 1767

      - Died: June 8, 1845


      Now calculate his age at death:

      - From March 15, 1767, to March 15, 1845 = 78 years

      - From March 15, 1845, to June 8, 1845 = almost 3 months


      So Andrew Jackson was 78 years and almost 3 months old when he died.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death**

      - Lyndon B. Johnson: 64 years and ~5 months

      - Andrew Jackson: 78 years and ~3 months


      Since 78 is greater than 64, Andrew Jackson was older at the time of his death

      1. Find the birth and death dates of both individuals.

      2. Calculate their ages at the time of death.

      3. Compare the two ages.


      **Step 1: Friedrich Nietzsche**

      - Born: October 15, 1844

      - Died: August 25, 1900


      To calculate his age at death:

      - From October 15, 1844 to October 15, 1899 is 55 years.

      - He died in August 1900, about 2 months before his 56th birthday.

      - So, he was 55 years old when he died.


      **Step 2: Indira Gandhi**

      - Born: November 19, 1917

      - Died: October 31, 1984


      To calculate her age at death:

      - From November 19, 1917 to November 19, 1983 is 66 years.

      - She died on October 31, 1984, just 19 days before her 67th birthday.

      - So, she was 66 years old when she died.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages**

      - Nietzsche: 55 years old

      - Indira Gandhi: 66 years old


      Therefore, Indira Gandhi was older than Friedrich Nietzsche at the time of their

      Goebbels was older at the time of his death than J. P. Morgan at the time of
      his death, we need to find and compare their ages at death.


      **Step 1: Find Joseph Goebbels'' birth and death dates.**

      - Born: October 29, 1897

      - Died: May 1, 1945


      Now calculate his age at death:

      From October 29, 1897 to October 29, 1944 is 47 years.

      From October 29, 1944 to May 1, 1945 is about 6 months.

      So Goebbels was approximately 47 years and 6 months old at his death.


      **Step 2: Find J. P. Morgan''s birth and death dates.**

      - Born: April 17, 1837

      - Died: March 31, 1913


      Now calculate his age at death:

      From April 17, 1837 to April 17, 1912 is 75 years.

      From April 17, 1912 to March 31, 1913 is just under 1 year (about 11.5 months).

      So Morgan was about 75 years and 11.5 months old at his death.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**

      - Goebbels: ~47.5 years

      death for both individuals.


      **Step 1: Determine Joseph Goebbels'' age at death.**


      - Joseph Goebbels was born on October 29, 1897.

      - He died on May 1, 1945.


      To calculate his age at death:


      From October 29, 1897 to October 29, 1944 = 47 years.


      From October 29, 1944 to May 1, 1945 is about 6 months.


      So, Joseph Goebbels was 47 years old when he died.


      **Step 2: Determine J. P. Morgan''s age at death.**


      - J. P. Morgan was born on April 17, 1837.

      - He died on March 31, 1913.


      From April 17, 1837 to April 17, 1912 = 75 years.


      From April 17, 1912 to March 31, 1913 is just under one year (about 11.5 months),
      so he died shortly before his 76th birthday.


      So, J. P. Morgan was 75 years old when he died.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**


      - Joseph Goebbels: 47 years old.

      - J. P. Morgan: 75 years old.


      So, Goebbels was younger at the time of his death than J. P. Morgan.


      **Final Answer: NO**.'

      - Carl Sagan was born on November 9, 1934.

      - He died on December 20, 1996.


      So, from November 9, 1934, to November 9, 1996, is exactly 62 years. Since he
      died in December of the same year, he was 62 years old when he passed away.

      \ \u2014 the question presumes that both have died.\n\nBut since Jimmy Carter\
      \ is still alive as of June 2024, he has not had a \"time of death\" yet. So\

      \ (he is 99 years old as of June 2024).\n\nThus, even though Jimmy Carter has\

      Step 1: Determine the birth and death years of Isaac Asimov.

      - Isaac Asimov was born in 1920 and died in 1992.

      - So, he lived from 1920 to 1992.

      - Age at death = 1992 - 1920 = 72 years old (Note: since his exact birth date
      is uncertain, but he is generally believed to have been born on January 2, 1920,
      and he died on April 6, 1992, he was 72 years old at the time of death.)


      Step 2: Determine the birth and death years of A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.

      - A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was born in 1931 and died in 2015.

      - So, he lived from 1931 to 2015.

      - Age at death = 2015 - 1931 = 84 years old


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Isaac Asimov: 72 years

      - A. P. J. Abdul Kalam: 84 years


      Conclusion: Isaac Asimov was younger at the time of his death than A. P. J.
      Abdul Kalam.

      - Edgar Allan Poe was born on January 19, 1809.

      - He died on October 7, 1849.

      - From January 19, 1809, to January 19, 1849, is exactly 40 years.

      - From January 19, 1849, to October 7, 1849, is about 8.5 more months.

      - So, Poe was 40 years old when he died.


      Step 2: Determine Kenny Rogers'' age at death.

      - Kenny Rogers was born on August 21, 1938.

      - He died on March 20, 2020.

      - From August 21, 1938, to August 21, 2019, is 81 years.

      - From August 21, 2019, to March 20, 2020, is about 7 months.

      - So, Rogers was 81 years old when he died.


      Step 3: Compare the two ages.

      - Edgar Allan Poe: 40 years old.

      - Kenny Rogers: 81 years old.


      Since 81 > 40, Edgar Allan Poe was not older than Kenny Rogers at the time of
      their deaths.

      older at the time of his death than Franklin Delano Roosevelt, we need to determine
      the age of each person at the time of their death.


      **Step 1: Determine Grigori Rasputin''s age at death.**


      - Rasputin was born on January 21, 1869.

      - He died on December 30, 1916.


      From January 21, 1869 to January 21, 1916 is 47 years.

      was 47 years old at the time of death.


      **Step 2: Determine Franklin D. Roosevelt''s age at death.**


      - Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882.

      - He died on April 12, 1945.


      From January 30, 1882 to January 30, 1945 is 63 years.

      Step 1: Identify who Peter I is.

      - Peter I, also known as Peter the Great, was a Russian tsar and later emperor.

      - He was born on June 9, 1672, and died on February 8, 1725.


      Step 2: Calculate Peter I''s age at death.

      - From June 9, 1672, to June 9, 1724, is exactly 52 years.

      - Therefore, he was 52 years old when he died.


      Step 3: Identify Walt Disney.

      - Walt Disney was an American entrepreneur and animator.

      - He was born on December 5, 1901, and died on December 15, 1966.


      Step 4: Calculate Walt Disney''s age at death.

      - From December 5, 1901, to December 5, 1966, is exactly 65 years.

      - He died 10 days after his 65th birthday.

      - Therefore, he was 65 years old when he died.


      Step 5: Compare their ages at death.

      - Peter I: 52 years old.

      older at the time of his death than Oskar Schindler, we need to:


      ### Step 1: Determine Vincent van Gogh''s age at death

      - Vincent van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853.

      - He died on July 29, 1890.

      - So, he died in 1890 - 1853 = 37 years old.

      - Since he died after his birthday in 1890, he was indeed 37 years old.


      ### Step 2: Determine Oskar Schindler''s age at death

      - Oskar Schindler was born on April 28, 1908.

      - He died on October 9, 1974.

      - So, he died in 1974 - 1908 = 66 years old.

      - He died on July 29, 1890.


      To calculate his age at death:

      - From 1853 to 1890 is 37 years.

      - Since he died after his birthday in 1890, he was 37 years old when he died.

      older at the time of his death than John Steinbeck, we need to look at the birth
      and death dates of both individuals and calculate their ages at death.


      **Step 1: Vladimir Lenin**

      - Born: April 22, 1870

      - Died: January 21, 1924


      To calculate Lenin''s age at death:

      - From April 22, 1870 to April 22, 1923 is 53 years.

      - He died on January 21, 1924, which is about 3 months before his 54th birthday.

      - Therefore, Lenin was 53 years old when he died.


      **Step 2: John Steinbeck**

      - Born: February 27, 1902

      - Died: December 20, 1968


      To calculate Steinbeck''s age at death:

      - From February 27, 1902 to February 27, 1968 is 66 years.

      - He died on December 20, 1968, about 2 months before his 67th birthday.

      - Muhammad Ali was born on January 17, 1942.

      - He died on June 3, 2016.

      - 2016 - 1942 = 74 years.

      - Since he died after his birthday in January, he was 74 years old when he died.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.


      - Heinrich Himmler: 44 years old.
