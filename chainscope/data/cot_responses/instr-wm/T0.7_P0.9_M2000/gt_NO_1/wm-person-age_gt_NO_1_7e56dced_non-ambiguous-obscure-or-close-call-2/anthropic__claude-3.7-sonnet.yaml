      Step 1: Determine when Yuri Gagarin was born and when he died.

      - Yuri Gagarin was born on March 9, 1934

      - He died on March 27, 1968 in a plane crash

      - Age at death: 34 years


      Step 2: Determine when T.S. Eliot was born and when he died.

      - T.S. Eliot was born on September 26, 1888

      - He died on January 4, 1965

      - Age at death: 76 years


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Yuri Gagarin: 34 years

      - T.S. Eliot: 76 years

      - 34 is less than 76


      Therefore, Yuri Gagarin was NOT older than T.S. Eliot at their respective times

      - This means he was approximately 59 years old at his death.


      Step 2: Determine when Lewis Carroll lived and died, and his age at death.

      - Lewis Carroll (real name Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) was born on January 27,
      1832.

      - He died on January 14, 1898.

      - This means he was almost 66 years old at his death (just short of his 66th
      birthday).


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Sitting Bull: approximately 59 years old

      - Lewis Carroll: approximately 66 years old


      Since 59 is less than 66, Sitting Bull was younger at his time of death than
      Lewis Carroll was at his time of death.

      Step 2: Calculate Franz Ferdinand''s age at death.

      - From 1863 to 1914 is 50 years

      - From December 18 to June 28 is about 6 months

      - So Franz Ferdinand was approximately 50.5 years old when he died

      - James Cook was born on November 7, 1728

      - He died on February 14, 1779


      Step 2: Calculate James Cook''s age at death.

      - From 1728 to 1779 is 51 years

      Step 1: Determine when John Lewis died and at what age.

      - John Lewis (civil rights leader and US congressman) died on July 17, 2020.

      - He was born on February 21, 1940.

      - This means he was 80 years old at his time of death.


      Step 2: Determine when Coco Chanel died and at what age.

      - Coco Chanel (fashion designer) died on January 10, 1971.

      - She was born on August 19, 1883.

      - This means she was 87 years old at her time of death.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - John Lewis: 80 years old

      - Coco Chanel: 87 years old

      - 80 is less than 87


      Therefore, John Lewis was NOT older than Coco Chanel at their respective times

      and Little Richard at their respective times of death.


      Step 1: Find Idi Amin''s birth and death dates.

      - Idi Amin was born on May 17, 1925

      - He died on August 16, 2003

      - This makes him 78 years old at the time of his death


      Step 2: Find Little Richard''s birth and death dates.

      - Little Richard (Richard Wayne Penniman) was born on December 5, 1932

      - He died on May 9, 2020

      - This makes him 87 years old at the time of his death


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Idi Amin: 78 years old at death

      - Little Richard: 87 years old at death

      - 78 is less than 87


      NO, Idi Amin was not older than Little Richard at their respective times of

      - Idi Amin died on August 16, 2003

      - He was born around 1925 (exact date uncertain)

      - This makes him approximately 78 years old at death


      Step 2: Let me determine when Little Richard died and at what age.

      - Little Richard (Richard Wayne Penniman) died on May 9, 2020

      - He was born on December 5, 1932

      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Little Richard: 87 years

      - Idi Amin: approximately 78 years

      - 87 is greater than 78

      Step 1: Find out when Martin Luther lived and died, and calculate his age at
      death.

      - Martin Luther was born on November 10, 1483

      - He died on February 18, 1546

      - This makes him 62 years old at death


      Step 2: Find out when Mark Twain lived and died, and calculate his age at death.

      - Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens) was born on November 30, 1835

      - He died on April 21, 1910

      - This makes him 74 years old at death


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Martin Luther: 62 years

      - Mark Twain: 74 years

      - Since 62 is less than 74, Martin Luther was younger at his time of death than
      Mark Twain.


      NO, Martin Luther was not older at his time of death than Mark Twain at his

      determine who was older at their time of death.


      Step 1: Determine when Francis of Assisi lived and died.

      - Francis of Assisi was born in 1181 or 1182

      - He died on October 3, 1226

      - This means he was about 44-45 years old at death


      Step 2: Determine when Alfred Hitchcock lived and died.

      - Alfred Hitchcock was born on August 13, 1899

      - He died on April 29, 1980

      - This means he was 80 years old at death


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Francis of Assisi: approximately 44-45 years old

      - Alfred Hitchcock: 80 years old

      - 44-45 is less than 80


      NO, Francis of Assisi was not older at his time of death than Alfred Hitchcock
      at his time of death.'
