      was older at his time of death than T. S. Eliot at his time of death, we need
      to find out their ages at the time of death.


      1. **Yuri Gagarin''s Age at Death**: Yuri Gagarin was born on March 9, 1934,
      and he died on March 27, 1968. So, at the time of his death, he was 34 years
      old.


      2. **T. S. Eliot''s Age at Death**: T. S. Eliot was born on September 26, 1888,
      and he died on January 4, 1965. Therefore, at the time of his death, he was
      76 years old.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death:

      - Yuri Gagarin was 34 years old.

      - T. S. Eliot was 76 years old.


      Since 34 (Yuri Gagarin''s age at death) is less than 76 (T. S. Eliot''s age
      at death), Yuri Gagarin was not older at the time of his death than T. S. Eliot.


      The answer to the question "Was Yuri Gagarin older at their time of death than

      1. **Find the year of death for Bruce Lee**: Bruce Lee died on July 20, 1973.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Bruce Lee**: Bruce Lee was born on November
      27, 1940.

      3. **Calculate the age of Bruce Lee at death**: Bruce Lee was 32 years old at
      the time of his death (1973 - 1940 = 33, but he died before his 33rd birthday).

      4. **Find the year of death for Leonard Nimoy**: Leonard Nimoy died on February
      27, 2015.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Leonard Nimoy**: Leonard Nimoy was born on March
      26, 1931.

      6. **Calculate the age of Leonard Nimoy at death**: Leonard Nimoy was 83 years
      old at the time of his death (2015 - 1931 = 84, but he died before his 84th
      birthday).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Bruce Lee was 32 years old.

      - Leonard Nimoy was 83 years old.


      Since 83 (Leonard Nimoy''s age) is greater than 32 (Bruce Lee''s age), Leonard
      Nimoy was older at the time of his death than Bruce Lee.


      The answer to the question "Was Bruce Lee older at their time of death than
      Leonard Nimoy at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      died on July 4, 1826. Therefore, John Adams was 90 years old when he died.


      Given these ages:

      - Alfred Nobel was 63 years old at his death.

      - John Adams was 90 years old at his death.


      Since 63 is less than 90, Alfred Nobel was not older at the time of his death

      died.

      - John Wayne was 72 years old when he died.


      Since 39 (Amelia Earhart''s age at death) is less than 72 (John Wayne''s age
      at death), Amelia Earhart was not older at the time of her death than John Wayne
      was at the time of his death.

    c0e47ad8-6aa1-4ffc-9644-c4f579c4b7d9: 'To answer this question,
      we need to compare the ages of Amelia Earhart and John Wayne at the time of
      their deaths. Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Find the year of death for Amelia Earhart**: Amelia Earhart disappeared
      on July 2, 1937, during an attempt to fly around the world. Although her body
      was never found, it is generally accepted that she died in the Pacific Ocean
      around that time.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Amelia Earhart**: Amelia Earhart was born on
      July 24, 1897.

      3. **Calculate the age of Amelia Earhart at death**: Assuming she died in 1937,
      Amelia Earhart was approximately 39 years old at the time of her death (1937
      - 1897 = 40, but since her birthday was in July and she died in July, she was
      39).

      4. **Find the year of death for John Wayne**: John Wayne died on June 11, 1979.

      5. **Find the year of birth for John Wayne**: John Wayne was born on May 26,
      1907.

      6. **Calculate the age of John Wayne at death**: John Wayne was 72 years old
      at the time of his death (1979 - 1907 = 72).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Amelia Earhart was approximately 39 years old.

      - John Wayne was 72 years old.


      Since 72 (John Wayne''s age) is greater than 39 (Amelia Earhart''s age), John
      Wayne was older at the time of his death than Amelia Earhart.


      The answer to the question "Was Amelia Earhart older at their time of death
      than John Wayne at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      of death is unknown, we can assume that she was approximately 39 years old at
      the time of her disappearance and presumed death.

      2. **John Wayne''s Age at Death**: John Wayne was born on May 26, 1907, and
      he died on June 11, 1979. Therefore, at the time of his death, he was 72 years

    8aa11a5a-cd71-4ddd-b3bd-4b5e278b836b: 'To answer this question,
      we need to compare the ages of Diana, Princess of Wales, and Humphrey Bogart
      at the time of their deaths. Here''s a step-by-step explanation:


      1. **Find the year of death for Diana, Princess of Wales**: Diana, Princess
      of Wales, died on August 31, 1997.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Diana, Princess of Wales**: Diana was born on
      July 1, 1961.

      3. **Calculate the age of Diana at death**: Diana was 36 years old at the time
      of her death (1997 - 1961 = 36).

      4. **Find the year of death for Humphrey Bogart**: Humphrey Bogart died on January
      14, 1957.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Humphrey Bogart**: Humphrey Bogart was born
      on December 25, 1899.

      6. **Calculate the age of Humphrey Bogart at death**: Humphrey Bogart was 57
      years old at the time of his death (1957 - 1899 = 58, but since his birthday
      was in December and he died in January, he was 57).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Diana, Princess of Wales, was 36 years old.

      - Humphrey Bogart was 57 years old.


      Since 57 (Humphrey Bogart''s age) is greater than 36 (Diana''s age), Humphrey
      Bogart was older at the time of his death than Diana, Princess of Wales.


      The answer to the question "Was Diana, Princess of Wales older at their time
      of death than Humphrey Bogart at their time of death?" is: **NO**'
    f9b2b066-c27d-4bcb-9d64-9cb5bc97d09a: 'To determine if Diana, Princess
      of Wales was older at the time of her death than Humphrey Bogart at the time
      of his death, we need to compare their ages at the time of their respective
      deaths.


      1. **Diana, Princess of Wales**: Diana was born on July 1, 1961, and died on
      August 31, 1997. Therefore, she was 36 years old when she died.

      2. **Humphrey Bogart**: Humphrey Bogart was born on December 25, 1899, and died
      on January 14, 1957. Therefore, he was 57 years old when he died.


      Given these ages:

      - Diana, Princess of Wales was 36 years old at her death.

      - Humphrey Bogart was 57 years old at his death.


      Since 57 is greater than 36, Humphrey Bogart was older at the time of his death
      than Diana, Princess of Wales was at the time of her death.


      The answer is: **NO**'

      6. **Calculate the age of Indira Gandhi at death**: Gandhi died at the age of
      66 (1984 - 1917 = 67, but she was not yet 67 on the day she died, so we round
      down to 66).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Friedrich Nietzsche was 55 years old.

      - Indira Gandhi was 66 years old.


      Since 66 (Indira Gandhi''s age) is greater than 55 (Friedrich Nietzsche''s age),
      Indira Gandhi was older at the time of her death than Friedrich Nietzsche.


      The answer to the question "Was Friedrich Nietzsche older at their time of death
      than Indira Gandhi at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      we need to compare the ages of Alan Turing and Galileo Galilei at the time of
      their deaths. Here''s a step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Find the year of death for Alan Turing**: Alan Turing died on June 7, 1954.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Alan Turing**: Alan Turing was born on June
      23, 1912.

      3. **Calculate the age of Alan Turing at death**: Alan Turing was 41 years old
      at the time of his death (1954 - 1912 = 42, but since his birthday was in June
      and he died in June, he was 41).

      4. **Find the year of death for Galileo Galilei**: Galileo Galilei died on January
      8, 1642.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Galileo Galilei**: Galileo Galilei was born
      on February 15, 1564.

      6. **Calculate the age of Galileo Galilei at death**: Galileo Galilei was 77
      years old at the time of his death (1642 - 1564 = 78, but since his birthday
      was in February and he died in January, he was 77).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Alan Turing was 41 years old.

      - Galileo Galilei was 77 years old.


      Since 41 (Alan Turing''s age) is less than 77 (Galileo Galilei''s age), Alan
      Turing was not older at the time of his death than Galileo Galilei was at the
      time of his death.


      The answer to the question "Was Alan Turing older at their time of death than
      Galileo Galilei at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      known as the "Red Baron," was born on May 2, 1892, and died on April 21, 1918.
      At the time of his death, he was approximately 25 years old (1918 - 1892 = 26,
      but since he died in April, he was 25 at the time of his death).


      2. **Audrey Hepburn''s Age at Death**: Audrey Hepburn was born on May 4, 1929,
      and died on January 20, 1993. At the time of her death, she was approximately
      63 years old (1993 - 1929 = 64, but since she died in January, she was 63 at
      the time of her death).

      1. **Find the year of death for William Wallace**: William Wallace was executed
      on August 23, 1305.

      2. **Find the year of birth for William Wallace**: The exact date of birth for

      3. **Calculate the age of William Wallace at death**: Assuming the birth year
      range, if we take the earliest birth year (1270), he would be approximately
      35 years old at the time of death (1305 - 1270 = 35). If we take the latest
      birth year (1276), he would be approximately 29 years old (1305 - 1276 = 29).

      1. **Arthur Conan Doyle''s Age at Death**: Arthur Conan Doyle was born on May
      22, 1859, and died on July 7, 1930. So, at the time of his death, he was 71
      years old.


      2. **John Paul II''s Age at Death**: John Paul II was born on May 18, 1920,
      and died on April 2, 2005. So, at the time of his death, he was 84 years old.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death: Arthur Conan Doyle was 71 years
      old, and John Paul II was 84 years old.


      Given these ages, we can see that John Paul II was indeed older than Arthur
      Conan Doyle at the time of their respective deaths. The question asks if Arthur
      Conan Doyle was older at the time of death than John Paul II at the time of
      death. Since John Paul II was older, the answer to the question is NO.

      92 years old (1997 - 1904 = 93, but since his birthday was in August and he
      died in February, he was 92).


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death:

      - Carl Sagan was 62 years old at his death.

      - Deng Xiaoping was 92 years old at his death.


      Since 92 is greater than 62, Deng Xiaoping was indeed older at the time of his
      death than Carl Sagan.


      The answer is: $\boxed{NO}$

      1. **Determine the date of death for John the Baptist**: The exact date of John
      the Baptist''s death is not known, but it is believed to have occurred around
      30-36 AD. For the purpose of this comparison, let''s use the year 30 AD as the
      date of his death.

      2. **Determine the date of birth for John the Baptist**: The exact date of John
      the Baptist''s birth is also not known, but it is estimated to be around 5-6
      BC. For this comparison, let''s use the year 5 BC as his birth year.

      3. **Calculate the age of John the Baptist at the time of his death**: John
      the Baptist died in 30 AD, and he was born in 5 BC. To calculate his age at
      the time of his death, we need to add 30 AD and 5 BC, which gives us 35 years
      (30 + 5 = 35). Therefore, John the Baptist was approximately 35 years old at
      the time of his death.

      4. **Determine the date of death for Woodrow Wilson**: Woodrow Wilson died on
      February 3, 1924.

      5. **Determine the date of birth for Woodrow Wilson**: Woodrow Wilson was born
      on December 28, 1856.

      6. **Calculate the age of Woodrow Wilson at the time of his death**: Woodrow
      Wilson died in 1924, and he was born in 1856. To calculate his age at the time
      of his death, we need to subtract 1856 from 1924, which gives us 68 years (1924
      - 1856 = 68). Therefore, Woodrow Wilson was 68 years old at the time of his
      death.


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - John the Baptist was approximately 35 years old.

      - Woodrow Wilson was 68 years old.


      Since 35 (John the Baptist''s age) is less than 68 (Woodrow Wilson''s age),
      John the Baptist was not older at the time of his death than Woodrow Wilson.


      The answer to the question "Was John the Baptist older at their time of death
      than Woodrow Wilson at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      we need to compare the ages of Amy Winehouse and Charlie Chaplin at the time
      of their deaths. Here''s a step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Find the year of death for Amy Winehouse**: Amy Winehouse died on July
      23, 2011.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Amy Winehouse**: Amy Winehouse was born on September
      14, 1983.

      3. **Calculate the age of Amy Winehouse at death**: Amy Winehouse was 27 years
      old at the time of her death (2011 - 1983 = 27).

      4. **Find the year of death for Charlie Chaplin**: Charlie Chaplin died on December
      25, 1977.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Charlie Chaplin**: Charlie Chaplin was born
      on April 16, 1889.

      6. **Calculate the age of Charlie Chaplin at death**: Charlie Chaplin was 88
      years old at the time of his death (1977 - 1889 = 88).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Amy Winehouse was 27 years old.

      - Charlie Chaplin was 88 years old.


      Since 88 (Charlie Chaplin''s age) is greater than 27 (Amy Winehouse''s age),
      Charlie Chaplin was older at the time of his death than Amy Winehouse.


      The answer to the question "Was Amy Winehouse older at their time of death than
      Charlie Chaplin at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      1. **Fyodor Dostoyevsky''s Age at Death**: Fyodor Dostoyevsky was born on November
      11, 1821, and died on February 9, 1881. Therefore, he was 59 years old when

      - Fyodor Dostoyevsky was 59 years old at his death.

      - Hank Aaron was 86 years old at his death.

      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death: Martin Luther King Jr. was 39
      years old, and Victor Hugo was 83 years old.


      Given these ages, it is clear that Victor Hugo was indeed older than Martin
      Luther King Jr. at the time of their respective deaths. The question asks if
      Martin Luther King Jr. was older at the time of death than Victor Hugo at the
      time of death. Since Victor Hugo was older, the answer to the question is NO.

      2. **Johannes Gutenberg''s Age at Death**: Johannes Gutenberg was born around
      1398 and died on February 3, 1468. Therefore, at the time of his death, he was

      1. **Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart''s Age at Death**: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was
      born on January 27, 1756, and he died on December 5, 1791. Therefore, Mozart

      let''s compare the ages of Kurt Cobain and Elvis Presley at the time of their
      deaths. Here''s a step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Kurt Cobain''s Age at Death**: Kurt Cobain was born on February 20, 1967,
      and died on April 5, 1994. So, at the time of his death, he was 27 years old.

      2. **Elvis Presley''s Age at Death**: Elvis Presley was born on January 8, 1935,
      and died on August 16, 1977. Therefore, at the time of his death, he was 42
      years old.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death, we can see that Kurt Cobain
      was 27 years old, and Elvis Presley was 42 years old.


      Given these ages, we can conclude that Elvis Presley was indeed older than Kurt
      Cobain at the time of their respective deaths. The question asks if Kurt Cobain
      was older at the time of death than Elvis Presley at the time of death. Since
      Elvis Presley was older, the answer to the question is NO.

      we need to compare the ages of H. G. Wells and Larry King at the time of their
      deaths. Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Find the year of death for H. G. Wells**: H. G. Wells died on August 13,
      1946.

      2. **Find the year of birth for H. G. Wells**: H. G. Wells was born on September
      21, 1866.

      3. **Calculate the age of H. G. Wells at death**: H. G. Wells was 79 years old
      at the time of his death (1946 - 1866 = 80, but since his birthday was in September
      and he died in August, he was 79).

      4. **Find the year of death for Larry King**: Larry King died on January 23,
      2021.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Larry King**: Larry King was born on November
      19, 1933.

      6. **Calculate the age of Larry King at death**: Larry King was 87 years old
      at the time of his death (2021 - 1933 = 88, but since his birthday was in November
      and he died in January, he was 87).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - H. G. Wells was 79 years old.

      - Larry King was 87 years old.


      Since 87 (Larry King''s age) is greater than 79 (H. G. Wells'' age), Larry King
      was older at the time of his death than H. G. Wells.

      2. **Alfred Hitchcock''s Age at Death**: Alfred Hitchcock was born on August
      13, 1899, and died on April 29, 1980. So, at the time of his death, he was 80
      years old.


      Comparing the ages at the time of death, we can see that Alfred Hitchcock was
      older than Francis of Assisi. Since the question asks if Francis of Assisi was
      older at the time of death than Alfred Hitchcock, the answer is **NO**'

      of Assisi was older at the time of his death than Alfred Hitchcock at the time
      of his death, we need to compare their ages at the time of their deaths. Here''s
      a step-by-step process:


      1. **Determine the year of death for Francis of Assisi**: Francis of Assisi
      died on October 3, 1226.

      2. **Determine the year of birth for Francis of Assisi**: Francis of Assisi
      was born on September 26, 1181 or 1182 (the exact year is uncertain).

      3. **Calculate the age of Francis of Assisi at the time of his death**: If we
      take the earlier birth year (1181), Francis of Assisi would be 45 years old
      at the time of his death (1226 - 1181 = 45). If we take the later birth year
      (1182), he would be 44 years old (1226 - 1182 = 44). For the purpose of this
      comparison, let''s consider the earlier birth year (1181) and say he was 45
      years old at death.

      4. **Determine the year of death for Alfred Hitchcock**: Alfred Hitchcock died
      on April 29, 1980.

      5. **Determine the year of birth for Alfred Hitchcock**: Alfred Hitchcock was
      born on August 13, 1899.

      6. **Calculate the age of Alfred Hitchcock at the time of his death**: Alfred
      Hitchcock was 80 years old at the time of his death (1980 - 1899 = 80).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Francis of Assisi was 45 years old.

      - Alfred Hitchcock was 80 years old.


      Since 45 (Francis of Assisi''s age) is less than 80 (Alfred Hitchcock''s age),
      Francis of Assisi was not older at the time of his death than Alfred Hitchcock.


      The answer to the question "Was Francis of Assisi older at their time of death
      than Alfred Hitchcock at their time of death?" is: **NO**'
