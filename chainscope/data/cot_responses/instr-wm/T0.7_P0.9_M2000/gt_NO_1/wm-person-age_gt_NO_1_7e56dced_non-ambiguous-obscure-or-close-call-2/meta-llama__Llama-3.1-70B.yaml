      was older at his time of death than T. S. Eliot at his time of death, we need
      to find out their ages at the time of death.


      1. **Yuri Gagarin''s Age at Death**: Yuri Gagarin was born on March 9, 1934,
      and he died on March 27, 1968. So, at the time of his death, he was 34 years
      old.


      2. **T. S. Eliot''s Age at Death**: T. S. Eliot was born on September 26, 1888,
      and he died on January 4, 1965. Therefore, at the time of his death, he was
      76 years old.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death:

      - Yuri Gagarin was 34 years old.

      - T. S. Eliot was 76 years old.


      Since 34 (Yuri Gagarin''s age at death) is less than 76 (T. S. Eliot''s age
      at death), Yuri Gagarin was not older at the time of his death than T. S. Eliot.


      The answer to the question "Was Yuri Gagarin older at their time of death than
      T. S. Eliot at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      we need to compare the ages of Bruce Lee and Leonard Nimoy at the time of their
      deaths. Here''s a step-by-step process:


      1. **Find the year of death for Bruce Lee**: Bruce Lee died on July 20, 1973.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Bruce Lee**: Bruce Lee was born on November
      27, 1940.

      3. **Calculate the age of Bruce Lee at death**: Bruce Lee was 32 years old at
      the time of his death (1973 - 1940 = 33, but he died before his 33rd birthday).

      4. **Find the year of death for Leonard Nimoy**: Leonard Nimoy died on February
      27, 2015.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Leonard Nimoy**: Leonard Nimoy was born on March
      26, 1931.

      6. **Calculate the age of Leonard Nimoy at death**: Leonard Nimoy was 83 years
      old at the time of his death (2015 - 1931 = 84, but he died before his 84th
      birthday).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Bruce Lee was 32 years old.

      - Leonard Nimoy was 83 years old.


      Since 83 (Leonard Nimoy''s age) is greater than 32 (Bruce Lee''s age), Leonard
      Nimoy was older at the time of his death than Bruce Lee.


      The answer to the question "Was Bruce Lee older at their time of death than
      Leonard Nimoy at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      1. **Bruce Lee''s Age at Death**: Bruce Lee was born on November 27, 1940, and
      he died on July 20, 1973. So, at the time of his death, he was 32 years old.


      2. **Leonard Nimoy''s Age at Death**: Leonard Nimoy was born on March 26, 1931,
      and he died on February 27, 2015. Therefore, at the time of his death, he was
      83 years old.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death: Bruce Lee was 32 years old,
      and Leonard Nimoy was 83 years old.


      Given these ages, we can see that Leonard Nimoy was indeed older than Bruce
      Lee at the time of their respective deaths. The question asks if Bruce Lee was
      older at the time of death than Leonard Nimoy at the time of death. Since Leonard
      Nimoy was older, the answer to the question is NO.

      1. **Che Guevara''s Age at Death**: Che Guevara was born on June 14, 1928, and
      died on October 9, 1967. So, at the time of his death, he was 39 years old.


      2. **Vasco da Gama''s Age at Death**: Vasco da Gama was born around 1469 and
      died on December 24, 1524. Therefore, at the time of his death, he was approximately

      Now, let''s find the age of Vasco da Gama at the time of his death:


      1. **Find the year of death for Vasco da Gama**: Vasco da Gama died on December
      24, 1524.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Vasco da Gama**: Vasco da Gama was born in 1460
      or 1469 (the exact year is not known with certainty). For the purpose of this
      comparison, let''s use the commonly cited birth year of 1469.

      3. **Calculate the age of Vasco da Gama at death**: Vasco da Gama was 55 years
      old at the time of his death (1524 - 1469 = 55).


      Now, we can compare the ages at the time of death:

      - Che Guevara was 39 years old.

      - Vasco da Gama was 55 years old.


      Since 55 is greater than 39, Vasco da Gama was older at the time of his death

      average lifespan of a human is around 70-80 years. 443 years is significantly
      larger than this average.

      5. **Conclusion**: Since the difference in years between their deaths is much
      larger than the average lifespan, it is highly unlikely that Che Guevara was
      older at their time of death than Vasco da Gama.

      we need to compare the ages of Amelia Earhart and John Wayne at the time of
      their deaths. Here''s a step-by-step approach:


      1. **Amelia Earhart''s Age at Death**: Amelia Earhart was born on July 24, 1897,
      and she disappeared during a flight on July 2, 1937, at the age of 39. It is
      assumed that she died around that time.


      2. **John Wayne''s Age at Death**: John Wayne was born on May 26, 1907, and
      he died on June 11, 1979, at the age of 72.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death:

      - Amelia Earhart was 39 years old when she disappeared and is presumed to have
      died.

      - John Wayne was 72 years old when he died.


      Since 39 (Amelia Earhart''s age at death) is less than 72 (John Wayne''s age
      at death), Amelia Earhart was not older at the time of her death than John Wayne

      we need to compare the ages of Amelia Earhart and John Wayne at the time of
      their deaths. Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Find the year of death for Amelia Earhart**: Amelia Earhart disappeared
      on July 2, 1937, during an attempt to fly around the world. Although her body
      was never found, it is generally accepted that she died in the Pacific Ocean
      around that time.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Amelia Earhart**: Amelia Earhart was born on
      July 24, 1897.

      3. **Calculate the age of Amelia Earhart at death**: Assuming she died in 1937,
      Amelia Earhart was approximately 39 years old at the time of her death (1937
      - 1897 = 40, but since her birthday was in July and she died in July, she was
      39).

      4. **Find the year of death for John Wayne**: John Wayne died on June 11, 1979.

      5. **Find the year of birth for John Wayne**: John Wayne was born on May 26,
      1907.

      6. **Calculate the age of John Wayne at death**: John Wayne was 72 years old
      at the time of his death (1979 - 1907 = 72).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Amelia Earhart was approximately 39 years old.

      - John Wayne was 72 years old.


      Since 72 (John Wayne''s age) is greater than 39 (Amelia Earhart''s age), John
      Wayne was older at the time of his death than Amelia Earhart.


      The answer to the question "Was Amelia Earhart older at their time of death

      2. **Find the year of birth for Amelia Earhart**: Amelia Earhart was born on
      July 24, 1897.

      3. **Calculate the age of Amelia Earhart at death**: Amelia Earhart was approximately
      41 years old at the time of her disappearance (1937 - 1897 = 40) and was declared
      legally dead at the age of 41 (1939 - 1897 = 42).

      4. **Find the year of death for John Wayne**: John Wayne died on June 11, 1979.

      5. **Find the year of birth for John Wayne**: John Wayne was born on May 26,

      at the time of her death than Humphrey Bogart was at the time of his death.


      The answer to the question "Was Diana, Princess of Wales older at their time
      of death than Humphrey Bogart at their time of death?" is: **NO**'
    7f319e85-bfb3-45ce-8fcd-ec7e69f8eff6: '<think></think>To answer this question,
      we need to compare the ages of Diana, Princess of Wales and Humphrey Bogart
      at the time of their deaths. Here''s a step-by-step approach:


      1. **Find the year of death for Diana, Princess of Wales**: Diana, Princess
      of Wales died on August 31, 1997.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Diana, Princess of Wales**: Diana, Princess
      of Wales was born on July 1, 1961.

      3. **Calculate the age of Diana, Princess of Wales at death**: Diana, Princess
      of Wales was 36 years old at the time of her death (1997 - 1961 = 36).

      4. **Find the year of death for Humphrey Bogart**: Humphrey Bogart died on January
      14, 1957.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Humphrey Bogart**: Humphrey Bogart was born
      on December 25, 1899.

      6. **Calculate the age of Humphrey Bogart at death**: Humphrey Bogart was 57
      years old at the time of his death (1957 - 1899 = 58, but since his birthday
      was in December and he died in January, he was 57).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Diana, Princess of Wales was 36 years old.

      - Humphrey Bogart was 57 years old.


      Since 57 (Humphrey Bogart''s age) is greater than 36 (Diana, Princess of Wales''s
      age), Humphrey Bogart was older at the time of his death than Diana, Princess
      of Wales.


      The answer to the question "Was Diana, Princess of Wales older at their time
      of death than Humphrey Bogart at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      1. **Ferdinand Marcos'' Age at Death**: Ferdinand Marcos was born on September
      11, 1917, and he died on September 28, 1989. So, at the time of his death, he
      was 72 years old (1989 - 1917 = 72).


      2. **Robert Kennedy''s Age at Death**: Robert Kennedy was born on November 20,
      1925, and he died on June 6, 1968. So, at the time of his death, he was 42 years
      old (1968 - 1925 = 42).


      Now, let''s compare their ages at the time of death:

      - Ferdinand Marcos was 72 years old.

      - Robert Kennedy was 42 years old.

      we need to compare the ages of Friedrich Nietzsche and Indira Gandhi at the
      time of their deaths. Here''s a step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Find the year of death for Friedrich Nietzsche**: Friedrich Nietzsche died
      on August 25, 1900.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Friedrich Nietzsche**: Friedrich Nietzsche was
      born on October 15, 1844.

      3. **Calculate the age of Friedrich Nietzsche at death**: Nietzsche died at
      the age of 55 (1900 - 1844 = 56, but he was not yet 56 on the day he died, so
      we round down to 55).

      4. **Find the year of death for Indira Gandhi**: Indira Gandhi died on October
      31, 1984.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Indira Gandhi**: Indira Gandhi was born on November
      19, 1917.

      6. **Calculate the age of Indira Gandhi at death**: Gandhi died at the age of
      66 (1984 - 1917 = 67, but she was not yet 67 on the day she died, so we round
      down to 66).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Friedrich Nietzsche was 55 years old.

      - Indira Gandhi was 66 years old.


      Since 66 (Indira Gandhi''s age) is greater than 55 (Friedrich Nietzsche''s age),
      Indira Gandhi was older at the time of her death than Friedrich Nietzsche.


      The answer to the question "Was Friedrich Nietzsche older at their time of death
      than Indira Gandhi at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      we need to compare the ages of Selena Quintanilla and Maya Angelou at the time
      of their deaths.


      1. **Selena Quintanilla''s Age at Death**: Selena Quintanilla was born on April
      16, 1971, and died on March 31, 1995. So, at the time of her death, she was
      23 years old.


      2. **Maya Angelou''s Age at Death**: Maya Angelou was born on April 4, 1928,
      and died on May 28, 2014. Therefore, at the time of her death, she was 86 years
      old.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death: Selena Quintanilla was 23 years
      old, and Maya Angelou was 86 years old.


      Given these ages, we can see that Maya Angelou was indeed older than Selena
      Quintanilla at the time of their respective deaths. The question asks if Selena
      Quintanilla was older at the time of death than Maya Angelou at the time of
      death. Since Maya Angelou was older, the answer to the question is NO.

      murdered on March 31, 1995.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Selena Quintanilla**: Selena Quintanilla was
      born on April 16, 1971.

      3. **Calculate the age of Selena Quintanilla at death**: Selena Quintanilla
      was 23 years old when she died (1995 - 1971 = 24, but she hadn''t reached her
      24th birthday yet, so she was 23).

      4. **Find the year of death for Maya Angelou**: Maya Angelou died on May 28,
      2014.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Maya Angelou**: Maya Angelou was born on April
      4, 1928.

      6. **Calculate the age of Maya Angelou at death**: Maya Angelou was 86 years

      2. **Galileo Galilei''s Age at Death**: Galileo Galilei was born on February
      15, 1564, and died on January 8, 1642. Therefore, at the time of his death,
      he was 77 years old.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death:

      - Alan Turing was 41 years old.

      - Galileo Galilei was 77 years old.


      Given these ages, it''s clear that Galileo Galilei was older than Alan Turing

      he was approximately 25 years old (1918 - 1892 = 26, but since he died before
      his birthday, he was 25 years old).


      2. **Audrey Hepburn''s Age at Death**: Audrey Hepburn was born on May 4, 1929,
      and died on January 20, 1993. Therefore, at the time of her death, she was approximately
      63 years old (1993 - 1929 = 64, but since she died before her birthday, she
      was 63 years old).


      Now, let''s compare their ages at the time of death:

      - Manfred von Richthofen was 25 years old.

      - Audrey Hepburn was 63 years old.


      Since 25 (Manfred von Richthofen''s age) is less than 63 (Audrey Hepburn''s

      we need to compare the ages of Ludwig van Beethoven and Marie Curie at the time
      of their deaths. Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Find the year of death for Ludwig van Beethoven**: Ludwig van Beethoven
      died on March 26, 1827.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Ludwig van Beethoven**: Ludwig van Beethoven
      was born on December 16, 1770.

      3. **Calculate the age of Ludwig van Beethoven at death**: Beethoven died at
      the age of 56 (1827 - 1770 = 57, but since his birthday was in December and
      he died in March, he was 56 years old at the time of his death).

      4. **Find the year of death for Marie Curie**: Marie Curie died on July 4, 1934.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Marie Curie**: Marie Curie was born on November
      7, 1867.

      6. **Calculate the age of Marie Curie at death**: Curie died at the age of 66
      (1934 - 1867 = 67, but since her birthday was in November and she died in July,
      she was 66 years old at the time of her death).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Ludwig van Beethoven was 56 years old.

      - Marie Curie was 66 years old.


      Since 66 (Marie Curie''s age) is greater than 56 (Ludwig van Beethoven''s age),
      Marie Curie was older at the time of her death than Ludwig van Beethoven.


      The answer to the question "Was Ludwig van Beethoven older at their time of
      death than Marie Curie at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      we need to compare the ages of William Wallace and Elizabeth I of England at
      the time of their deaths. Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Find the year of death for William Wallace**: William Wallace was executed
      on August 23, 1305.

      2. **Find the year of birth for William Wallace**: The exact date of birth for
      William Wallace is not known with certainty, but it is believed to be around
      1270-1276. For the purpose of this comparison, let''s use the range 1270-1276.

      3. **Calculate the age of William Wallace at death**: Assuming the birth year
      range, if we take the earliest birth year (1270), he would be approximately
      35 years old at the time of death (1305 - 1270 = 35). If we take the latest
      birth year (1276), he would be approximately 29 years old (1305 - 1276 = 29).
      So, his age at death could have been between 29 and 35 years old.

      4. **Find the year of death for Elizabeth I of England**: Elizabeth I died on
      March 24, 1603.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Elizabeth I of England**: Elizabeth I was born
      on September 7, 1533.

      6. **Calculate the age of Elizabeth I at death**: Elizabeth I was 69 years old
      at the time of her death (1603 - 1533 = 69).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - William Wallace was between 29 and 35 years old.

      - Elizabeth I was 69 years old.


      Since 69 (Elizabeth I''s age) is greater than both 29 and 35 (the possible ages
      for William Wallace), Elizabeth I was older at the time of her death than William
      Wallace.


      The answer to the question "Was William Wallace older at their time of death
      than Elizabeth I of England at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      we need to compare the ages of James Cook and Abraham Lincoln at the time of
      their deaths. Let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Find the year of death for James Cook**: James Cook died on February 14,
      1779.

      2. **Find the year of birth for James Cook**: James Cook was born on October
      27, 1728.

      3. **Calculate the age of James Cook at death**: Subtracting his birth year
      from his death year, James Cook was approximately 50 years old at the time of
      his death (1779 - 1728 = 51).


      Now, let''s do the same for Abraham Lincoln:


      1. **Find the year of death for Abraham Lincoln**: Abraham Lincoln died on April
      15, 1865.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Abraham Lincoln**: Abraham Lincoln was born
      on February 12, 1809.

      3. **Calculate the age of Abraham Lincoln at death**: Subtracting his birth
      year from his death year, Abraham Lincoln was 56 years old at the time of his
      death (1865 - 1809 = 56).


      Comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - James Cook was approximately 50 years old.

      - Abraham Lincoln was 56 years old.


      Since 56 (Abraham Lincoln''s age) is greater than 50 (James Cook''s age), Abraham
      Lincoln was older at the time of his death than James Cook.


      The answer to the question "Was James Cook older at their time of death than

      3. **Calculate the age of Anne Frank at death**: Assuming she died on January
      1, 1945, Anne Frank was approximately 15 years old at the time of her death
      (1945 - 1929 = 16 years, but since she was born in June and died in January,
      she was 15).

      4. **Find the year of death for Kobe Bryant**: Kobe Bryant died on January 26,
      2020.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Kobe Bryant**: Kobe Bryant was born on August
      23, 1978.

      6. **Calculate the age of Kobe Bryant at death**: Kobe Bryant was 41 years old
      at the time of his death (2020 - 1978 = 42 years, but since he was born in August
      and died in January, he was 41).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Anne Frank was approximately 15 years old.

      - Kobe Bryant was 41 years old.


      Since 41 (Kobe Bryant''s age) is greater than 15 (Anne Frank''s age), Kobe Bryant
      was older at the time of his death than Anne Frank.


      The answer to the question "Was Anne Frank older at their time of death than
      Kobe Bryant at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      we need to compare the ages of Anne Frank and Kobe Bryant at the time of their
      deaths. Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Find the year of death for Anne Frank**: Anne Frank died in February or
      March of 1945, at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. For the purpose of this
      comparison, let''s use the range February-March 1945.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Anne Frank**: Anne Frank was born on June 12,
      1929.

      3. **Calculate the age of Anne Frank at death**: Assuming the death date range,
      if we take the earliest death month (February 1945), she would be approximately
      15 years old at the time of death (1945 - 1929 = 16, but since her birthday
      was in June and she died in February, she was 15). If we take the latest death
      month (March 1945), she would be approximately 16 years old (1945 - 1929 = 16).
      So, her age at death could have been between 15 and 16 years old.

      4. **Find the year of death for Kobe Bryant**: Kobe Bryant died on January 26,
      2020.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Kobe Bryant**: Kobe Bryant was born on August
      23, 1978.

      6. **Calculate the age of Kobe Bryant at death**: Kobe Bryant was 41 years old
      at the time of his death (2020 - 1978 = 42, but since his birthday was in August
      and he died in January, he was 41).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Anne Frank was between 15 and 16 years old.

      - Kobe Bryant was 41 years old.


      Since 41 (Kobe Bryant''s age) is greater than both 15 and 16 (the possible ages
      for Anne Frank), Kobe Bryant was older at the time of his death than Anne Frank.


      The answer to the question "Was Anne Frank older at their time of death than
      Kobe Bryant at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      (634 - 573 = 61).

      4. **Find the year of death for George H. W. Bush**: George H. W. Bush died
      on November 30, 2018.

      5. **Find the year of birth for George H. W. Bush**: George H. W. Bush was born
      on June 12, 1924.

      6. **Calculate the age of George H. W. Bush at death**: George H. W. Bush was
      94 years old at the time of his death (2018 - 1924 = 94).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Abu Bakr was approximately 61 years old.

      - George H. W. Bush was 94 years old.


      Since 94 (George H. W. Bush''s age) is greater than 61 (Abu Bakr''s age), George
      H. W. Bush was older at the time of his death than Abu Bakr.


      The answer to the question "Was Abu Bakr older at their time of death than George
      H. W. Bush at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      Laden was older at the time of his death than Alighiero di Bellincione at the
      time of his death, we need to compare their ages at the time of death. Here
      are the steps to reason through this question:


      1. **Find the year of death for Osama bin Laden**: Osama bin Laden was killed
      on May 2, 2011.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Osama bin Laden**: Osama bin Laden was born
      on March 10, 1957.

      3. **Calculate the age of Osama bin Laden at death**: Osama bin Laden was 54
      years old when he died (2011 - 1957 = 54).


      Now, we need to find the age of Alighiero di Bellincione at the time of his
      death:


      4. **Find the year of death for Alighiero di Bellincione**: Alighiero di Bellincione
      died in 1314.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Alighiero di Bellincione**: The exact year of
      birth for Alighiero di Bellincione is not known, but he is believed to have
      been born around the year 1230.

      6. **Calculate the age of Alighiero di Bellincione at death**: Since the exact
      year of birth is not known, we can estimate his age at death. If we assume he
      was born in 1230, he would have been approximately 84 years old when he died
      (1314 - 1230 = 84).


      Now, let''s compare the ages at the time of death:


      - Osama bin Laden was 54 years old when he died.

      - Alighiero di Bellincione was approximately 84 years old when he died.


      Since 84 is greater than 54, Alighiero di Bellincione was older at the time
      of his death than Osama bin Laden.


      The answer to the question "Was Osama bin Laden older at their time of death

      5. **Find the year of birth for Alighiero di Bellincione**: Alighiero di Bellincione
      was born on June 4, 1264.

      6. **Calculate the age of Alighiero di Bellincione at death**: Alighiero di
      Bellincione was 50 years old at the time of his death (1314 - 1264 = 50).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Osama bin Laden was 54 years old.

      - Alighiero di Bellincione was 50 years old.

      of their deaths.


      1. **Find the year of death for Arthur Conan Doyle**: Arthur Conan Doyle died
      on July 7, 1930.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Arthur Conan Doyle**: Arthur Conan Doyle was
      born on May 22, 1859.

      3. **Calculate the age of Arthur Conan Doyle at death**: Arthur Conan Doyle
      was 71 years old at the time of his death (1930 - 1859 = 71).

      4. **Find the year of death for John Paul II**: John Paul II died on April 2,
      2005.

      5. **Find the year of birth for John Paul II**: John Paul II was born on May
      18, 1920.

      6. **Calculate the age of John Paul II at death**: John Paul II was 84 years
      old at the time of his death (2005 - 1920 = 85, but since his birthday was in
      May and he died in April, he was 84).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Arthur Conan Doyle was 71 years old.

      - John Paul II was 84 years old.


      Since 84 (John Paul II''s age) is greater than 71 (Arthur Conan Doyle''s age),
      John Paul II was older at the time of his death than Arthur Conan Doyle.


      The answer to the question "Was Arthur Conan Doyle older at their time of death
      than John Paul II at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      1. **Arthur Conan Doyle''s Age at Death**: Arthur Conan Doyle was born on May
      22, 1859, and died on July 7, 1930. So, at the time of his death, he was 71
      years old.


      2. **John Paul II''s Age at Death**: John Paul II was born on May 18, 1920,
      and died on April 2, 2005. Therefore, at the time of his death, he was 84 years
      old.


      Now, let''s compare their ages at the time of death:

      - Arthur Conan Doyle was 71 years old at the time of his death.

      - John Paul II was 84 years old at the time of his death.


      Given these ages, we can see that John Paul II was indeed older than Arthur
      Conan Doyle at the time of their respective deaths. The question asks if Arthur
      Conan Doyle was older at the time of death than John Paul II at the time of
      death. Since John Paul II was older, the answer to the question is NO.

      1996.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Carl Sagan**: Carl Sagan was born on November
      9, 1934.

      3. **Calculate the age of Carl Sagan at death**: Carl Sagan was 62 years old
      at the time of his death (1996 - 1934 = 62).

      4. **Find the year of death for Deng Xiaoping**: Deng Xiaoping died on February
      19, 1997.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Deng Xiaoping**: Deng Xiaoping was born on August
      22, 1904.

      6. **Calculate the age of Deng Xiaoping at death**: Deng Xiaoping was 92 years
      old at the time of his death (1997 - 1904 = 92).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Carl Sagan was 62 years old.

      - Deng Xiaoping was 92 years old.


      Since 92 (Deng Xiaoping''s age) is greater than 62 (Carl Sagan''s age), Deng
      Xiaoping was older at the time of his death than Carl Sagan.


      The answer to the question "Was Carl Sagan older at their time of death than

      old at the time of his death (1994 - 1913 = 81).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Muammar Gaddafi was 69 years old.

      - Richard Nixon was 81 years old.


      Since 81 (Richard Nixon''s age) is greater than 69 (Muammar Gaddafi''s age),
      Richard Nixon was older at the time of his death than Muammar Gaddafi.


      The answer to the question "Was Muammar Gaddafi older at their time of death

      records, John the Baptist was executed by beheading in approximately 32 AD.

      2. **Estimate the age of John the Baptist at death**: While the exact date of
      birth for John the Baptist is not known, it is commonly believed that he was
      born around 6 BC. If we assume this to be true, he would have been around 38
      years old at the time of his death (32 AD - 6 BC = 38).

      3. **Find the year of death for Woodrow Wilson**: Woodrow Wilson died on February
      3, 1924.

      4. **Find the year of birth for Woodrow Wilson**: Woodrow Wilson was born on
      December 28, 1856.

      5. **Calculate the age of Woodrow Wilson at death**: Woodrow Wilson was 67 years
      old at the time of his death (1924 - 1856 = 68, but since his birthday was in
      December and he died in February, he was 67).

      the year 30 CE. Since his exact birth date is unknown, we can''t calculate his
      age precisely. However, based on historical records, he is believed to have
      been around 30 years old when he died.

      2. **Woodrow Wilson''s Age at Death**: Woodrow Wilson was born on December 28,
      1856, and died on February 3, 1924. At the time of his death, he was 67 years
      old (1924 - 1856 = 68, but since his birthday was in December and he died in
      February, he was 67).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - John the Baptist was around 30 years old.

      - Woodrow Wilson was 67 years old.


      Since 67 (Woodrow Wilson''s age) is greater than 30 (John the Baptist''s estimated
      age), Woodrow Wilson was older at the time of his death than John the Baptist.


      The answer to the question "Was John the Baptist older at their time of death
      than Woodrow Wilson at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      Baptist was older at the time of his death than Woodrow Wilson at the time of

      1. **John the Baptist''s Age at Death**: John the Baptist is believed to have
      been born between 6 and 4 BC, and he was executed around 28-29 AD. Therefore,
      he was approximately 32-33 years old at the time of his death.


      2. **Woodrow Wilson''s Age at Death**: Woodrow Wilson was born on December 28,
      1856, and he died on February 3, 1924. So, at the time of his death, he was
      67 years old.


      Comparing their ages at the time of death:

      - John the Baptist: 32-33 years old

      - Woodrow Wilson: 67 years old


      Since 32-33 (John the Baptist''s age) is less than 67 (Woodrow Wilson''s age),
      John the Baptist was not older at the time of his death than Woodrow Wilson
      at the time of his death.

      1. **Woodrow Wilson''s Age at Death**: Woodrow Wilson was born on December 28,
      1856, and died on February 3, 1924. Therefore, at the time of his death, he
      was 67 years old.


      2. **John the Baptist''s Age at Death**: The exact age of John the Baptist at
      the time of his death is not known with certainty. However, he is believed to
      have been executed by King Herod Antipas around 30-33 CE. For the purpose of
      this comparison, let''s assume he was 30 years old at the time of his death.


      Given these ages:

      - Woodrow Wilson was 67 years old at his death.

      - John the Baptist was approximately 30 years old at his death.


      Since 30 is less than 67, John the Baptist was not older at the time of his

      Baptist was older at the time of his death than Woodrow Wilson at the time of
      his death, we need to compare their ages at the time of death. Here''s a step-by-step
      reasoning:


      1. **Find the year of death for John the Baptist**: John the Baptist is believed
      to have been executed around AD 30-32. For the purpose of this comparison, let''s
      use the year AD 30.

      2. **Find the year of birth for John the Baptist**: The exact year of birth
      for John the Baptist is not known, but it is estimated to be around 6 BC. For
      the purpose of this comparison, let''s use the year 6 BC.

      3. **Calculate the age of John the Baptist at death**: Assuming the birth year
      6 BC, John the Baptist would be approximately 36 years old at the time of his
      death (30 AD - 6 BC = 36 years).

      4. **Find the year of death for Woodrow Wilson**: Woodrow Wilson died on February
      3, 1924.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Woodrow Wilson**: Woodrow Wilson was born on
      December 28, 1856.

      6. **Calculate the age of Woodrow Wilson at death**: Woodrow Wilson was 67 years
      old at the time of his death (1924 - 1856 = 68 years, but since his birthday
      was in December and he died in February, he was 67).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - John the Baptist was approximately 36 years old.

      - Woodrow Wilson was 67 years old.


      Since 67 (Woodrow Wilson''s age) is greater than 36 (John the Baptist''s age),
      Woodrow Wilson was older at the time of his death than John the Baptist.


      The answer to the question "Was John the Baptist older at their time of death
      than Woodrow Wilson at their time of death?" is: **NO**'
    fb981330-56c0-4e08-b431-294928f11527: '<think></think>To answer this question,
      we need to compare the ages of John the Baptist and Woodrow Wilson at the time
      of their deaths. Let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Determine the date of death for John the Baptist**: The exact date of John
      the Baptist''s death is not known, but it is believed to have occurred around
      30-36 AD. For the purpose of this comparison, let''s use the year 30 AD as the
      date of his death.

      2. **Determine the date of birth for John the Baptist**: The exact date of John
      the Baptist''s birth is also not known, but it is estimated to be around 5-6
      BC. For this comparison, let''s use the year 5 BC as his birth year.

      3. **Calculate the age of John the Baptist at the time of his death**: John
      the Baptist died in 30 AD, and he was born in 5 BC. To calculate his age at
      the time of his death, we need to add 30 AD and 5 BC, which gives us 35 years
      (30 + 5 = 35). Therefore, John the Baptist was approximately 35 years old at
      the time of his death.

      4. **Determine the date of death for Woodrow Wilson**: Woodrow Wilson died on
      February 3, 1924.

      5. **Determine the date of birth for Woodrow Wilson**: Woodrow Wilson was born
      on December 28, 1856.

      6. **Calculate the age of Woodrow Wilson at the time of his death**: Woodrow
      Wilson died in 1924, and he was born in 1856. To calculate his age at the time
      of his death, we need to subtract 1856 from 1924, which gives us 68 years (1924
      - 1856 = 68). Therefore, Woodrow Wilson was 68 years old at the time of his
      death.


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - John the Baptist was approximately 35 years old.

      - Woodrow Wilson was 68 years old.


      Since 35 (John the Baptist''s age) is less than 68 (Woodrow Wilson''s age),
      John the Baptist was not older at the time of his death than Woodrow Wilson.


      The answer to the question "Was John the Baptist older at their time of death

      we need to compare the ages of Henri Matisse and Nelson Mandela at the time
      of their deaths.


      1. **Henri Matisse''s Age at Death**: Henri Matisse was born on December 31,
      1869, and died on November 3, 1954. At the time of his death, he was approximately
      84 years old (1954 - 1869 = 85, but since he was born on December 31, he was
      actually 84 years old when he died).

      2. **Nelson Mandela''s Age at Death**: Nelson Mandela was born on July 18, 1918,
      and died on December 5, 2013. At the time of his death, he was 95 years old
      (2013 - 1918 = 95).


      Comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Henri Matisse was 84 years old.

      - Nelson Mandela was 95 years old.


      Since 84 (Matisse''s age at death) is less than 95 (Mandela''s age at death),
      Matisse was not older than Mandela at the time of their deaths.


      The answer to the question "Was Henri Matisse older at their time of death than
      Nelson Mandela at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      1802, and died on December 5, 1870. At the time of his death, he was 68 years
      old (1870 - 1802 = 68).


      Now, we can compare the ages of Dante Alighieri and Alexandre Dumas at the time
      of their deaths:

      - Dante Alighieri was 56 years old at the time of his death.

      - Alexandre Dumas was 68 years old at the time of his death.


      Since 56 (Dante Alighieri''s age) is less than 68 (Alexandre Dumas'' age), we
      can conclude that Dante Alighieri was not older at the time of his death than
      Alexandre Dumas.


      The answer to the question "Was Dante Alighieri older at their time of death
      than Alexandre Dumas at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      Since 40 (Edgar Allan Poe''s age at death) is less than 81 (Kenny Rogers'' age
      at death), we can conclude that Edgar Allan Poe was not older at the time of
      his death than Kenny Rogers was at the time of his death.


      The answer to the question is: **NO**'
    e9528ea1-7287-49b4-87dc-82d277a29cd6: '<think></think>To determine if Edgar Allan
      Poe was older at the time of his death than Kenny Rogers, we need to compare
      their ages at the time of their respective deaths.


      1. **Edgar Allan Poe''s Age at Death**: Edgar Allan Poe was born on January
      19, 1809, and he died on October 7, 1849. Therefore, he was 40 years old at
      the time of his death.


      2. **Kenny Rogers'' Age at Death**: Kenny Rogers was born on August 21, 1938,
      and he died on March 20, 2020. Therefore, he was 81 years old at the time of
      his death.


      Given these ages, we can see that Kenny Rogers was older at the time of his
      death than Edgar Allan Poe was at the time of his death. The question asks if
      Edgar Allan Poe was older at the time of his death than Kenny Rogers. Since
      Kenny Rogers was older, the answer to the question is NO.

    ebffecc7-e4a4-49ae-a956-807e6d8c5642: '<think></think>To answer this question,
      we need to compare the ages of Edgar Allan Poe and Kenny Rogers at the time
      of their deaths. Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Find the year of death for Edgar Allan Poe**: Edgar Allan Poe died on October
      7, 1849.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Edgar Allan Poe**: Edgar Allan Poe was born
      on January 19, 1809.

      3. **Calculate the age of Edgar Allan Poe at death**: Edgar Allan Poe was 40
      years old at the time of his death (1849 - 1809 = 40).

      4. **Find the year of death for Kenny Rogers**: Kenny Rogers died on March 20,
      2020.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Kenny Rogers**: Kenny Rogers was born on August
      21, 1938.

      6. **Calculate the age of Kenny Rogers at death**: Kenny Rogers was 81 years
      old at the time of his death (2020 - 1938 = 81).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Edgar Allan Poe was 40 years old.

      - Kenny Rogers was 81 years old.


      Since 81 (Kenny Rogers'' age) is greater than 40 (Edgar Allan Poe''s age), Kenny
      Rogers was older at the time of his death than Edgar Allan Poe.


      The answer to the question "Was Edgar Allan Poe older at their time of death
      than Kenny Rogers at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      22, 1963.

      2. **Find the year of birth for C. S. Lewis**: C. S. Lewis was born on November
      29, 1898.

      3. **Calculate the age of C. S. Lewis at death**: C. S. Lewis was 64 years old
      at the time of his death (1963 - 1898 = 64).

      4. **Find the year of death for Carl Jung**: Carl Jung died on June 6, 1961.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Carl Jung**: Carl Jung was born on July 26,
      1875.

      6. **Calculate the age of Carl Jung at death**: Carl Jung was 85 years old at

      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - C. S. Lewis was 64 years old.

      - Carl Jung was 85 years old.


      Since 85 (Carl Jung''s age) is greater than 64 (C. S. Lewis''s age), Carl Jung
      was older at the time of his death than C. S. Lewis.


      The answer to the question "Was C. S. Lewis older at their time of death than

      1. **C. S. Lewis'' Age at Death**: C. S. Lewis was born on November 29, 1898,
      and died on November 22, 1963. Therefore, at the time of his death, he was approximately
      64 years and 359 days old.


      2. **Carl Jung''s Age at Death**: Carl Jung was born on July 26, 1875, and died
      on June 6, 1961. Therefore, at the time of his death, he was approximately 85
      years and 315 days old.


      Now, let''s compare the ages:

      - C. S. Lewis was approximately 64 years and 359 days old at the time of his
      death.

      - Carl Jung was approximately 85 years and 315 days old at the time of his death.


      Since Carl Jung''s age at death (85 years and 315 days) is greater than C. S.
      Lewis'' age at death (64 years and 359 days), we can conclude that Carl Jung
      was older at the time of his death than C. S. Lewis.

      and he died on January 22, 2021. This means he was 86 years old at the time
      of his death (2021 - 1934 = 87, but he had not yet had his birthday in 2021,

      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Fyodor Dostoyevsky was approximately 59 years old.

      - Hank Aaron was 86 years old.


      Since 59 is less than 86, Fyodor Dostoyevsky was not older at the time of his

      1. **Find the year of death for Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky**: Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky
      died on November 6, 1893.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky**: Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky
      was born on May 7, 1840.

      3. **Calculate the age of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky at death**: Pyotr Ilyich
      Tchaikovsky was 53 years old at the time of his death (1893 - 1840 = 53).

      4. **Find the year of death for Louis Pasteur**: Louis Pasteur died on September
      28, 1895.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Louis Pasteur**: Louis Pasteur was born on December
      27, 1822.

      6. **Calculate the age of Louis Pasteur at death**: Louis Pasteur was 72 years
      old at the time of his death (1895 - 1822 = 73, but since his birthday was in
      December and he died in September, he was 72).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was 53 years old.

      - Louis Pasteur was 72 years old.


      Since 72 (Louis Pasteur''s age) is greater than 53 (Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky''s
      age), Louis Pasteur was older at the time of his death than Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.


      The answer to the question "Was Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky older at their time
      of death than Louis Pasteur at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      5. **Find the year of birth for Agatha Christie**: Agatha Christie was born

      years old at the time of her death (1976 - 1890 = 86, but since her birthday
      was in September and she died in January, she was 85).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Richard I was 41 years old.

      - Agatha Christie was 85 years old.


      Since 85 (Agatha Christie''s age) is greater than 41 (Richard I''s age), Agatha
      Christie was older at the time of her death than Richard I.

      1. **Richard I''s Age at Death**: Richard I was born on September 8, 1157, and
      he died on April 6, 1199. So, at the time of his death, Richard I was 41 years
      old (1199 - 1157 = 42, but since he died before his birthday, he was 41).

      2. **Agatha Christie''s Age at Death**: Agatha Christie was born on September
      15, 1890, and she died on January 12, 1976. So, at the time of her death, Agatha
      Christie was 85 years old (1976 - 1890 = 86, but since she died before her birthday,
      she was 85).


      Now, let''s compare their ages at the time of death:

      - Richard I was 41 years old at his death.

      - Agatha Christie was 85 years old at her death.


      Since 41 (Richard I''s age) is less than 85 (Agatha Christie''s age), Richard
      I was not older than Agatha Christie at the time of their deaths.

      Comparing the ages:

      - Richard I was 42 years old at the time of his death.

      - Agatha Christie was 86 years old at the time of her death.


      Since 86 (Agatha Christie''s age) is greater than 42 (Richard I''s age), Agatha

      1. **Alexander Hamilton''s Age at Death**: Alexander Hamilton was born on January
      11, 1755, or 1757 (the exact year is disputed), and he died on July 12, 1804.
      If we use 1755 as his birth year, he was 49 years old when he died. If we use
      1757, he would have been 47 years old. For the purpose of this comparison, we''ll
      consider the commonly cited birth year of 1755, making him 49 years old at death.


      2. **Malcolm X''s Age at Death**: Malcolm X was born on May 19, 1925, and he
      died on February 21, 1965. Therefore, Malcolm X was 39 years old when he died.


      Given these ages:

      - Alexander Hamilton was 49 years old at his death.

      - Malcolm X was 39 years old at his death.


      Since 39 is less than 49, Malcolm X was not older at the time of his death than

      1. **Find the year of death for Malcolm X**: Malcolm X was assassinated on February
      21, 1965.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Malcolm X**: Malcolm X was born on May 19, 1925.

      3. **Calculate the age of Malcolm X at death**: Malcolm X was 39 years old at
      the time of his death (1965 - 1925 = 39).

      4. **Find the year of death for Alexander Hamilton**: Alexander Hamilton died
      on July 12, 1804.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Alexander Hamilton**: Alexander Hamilton was
      born on January 11, 1755, or 1757 (the exact year is disputed). For the purpose
      of this comparison, we''ll use the commonly cited birth year of 1755.

      6. **Calculate the age of Alexander Hamilton at death**: Alexander Hamilton
      was 49 years old at the time of his death (1804 - 1755 = 49).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Malcolm X was 39 years old.

      - Alexander Hamilton was 49 years old.


      Since 49 (Alexander Hamilton''s age) is greater than 39 (Malcolm X''s age),
      Alexander Hamilton was older at the time of his death than Malcolm X.


      The answer to the question "Was Malcolm X older at their time of death than

      1. **Peter I''s Age at Death**: Peter I, also known as Peter the Great, was
      born on May 30, 1672, and died on February 8, 1725. At the time of his death,
      he was approximately 52 years old (1725 - 1672 = 53, but since he died in February
      and was born in May, he was 52).


      2. **Walt Disney''s Age at Death**: Walt Disney was born on December 5, 1901,
      and died on December 15, 1966. At the time of his death, he was 65 years old
      (1966 - 1901 = 65).


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death:

      - Peter I was 52 years old.

      - Walt Disney was 65 years old.


      Since 52 (Peter I''s age) is less than 65 (Walt Disney''s age), Peter I was
      not older at the time of his death than Walt Disney.

      we need to compare the ages of Vincent van Gogh and Oskar Schindler at the time
      of their deaths. Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Find the year of death for Vincent van Gogh**: Vincent van Gogh died on
      July 29, 1890.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Vincent van Gogh**: Vincent van Gogh was born
      on March 30, 1853.

      3. **Calculate the age of Vincent van Gogh at death**: Vincent van Gogh was
      37 years old at the time of his death (1890 - 1853 = 37).

      4. **Find the year of death for Oskar Schindler**: Oskar Schindler died on October
      9, 1974.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Oskar Schindler**: Oskar Schindler was born
      on April 28, 1908.

      6. **Calculate the age of Oskar Schindler at death**: Oskar Schindler was 66
      years old at the time of his death (1974 - 1908 = 66).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Vincent van Gogh was 37 years old.

      - Oskar Schindler was 66 years old.

      Oskar Schindler was older at the time of his death than Vincent van Gogh.


      The answer to the question "Was Vincent van Gogh older at their time of death
      than Oskar Schindler at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      1. **Idi Amin''s Age at Death**: Idi Amin was born on May 17, 1925, and he died
      on August 16, 2003. Therefore, at the time of his death, Idi Amin was 78 years
      old (2003 - 1925 = 78).


      2. **Little Richard''s Age at Death**: Little Richard was born on December 5,

      Richard was 87 years old (2020 - 1932 = 88, but since his birthday was in December
      and he died in May, he was 87).


      Now, we can compare the ages at the time of their deaths:

      - Idi Amin was 78 years old when he died.

      - Little Richard was 87 years old when he died.


      Since 87 is greater than 78, Little Richard was indeed older at the time of

      3. **Calculate the age of Idi Amin at death**: If we assume he was born in 1925,
      he would have been around 78 years old at the time of his death (2003 - 1925
      = 78).

      4. **Find the year of death for Little Richard**: Little Richard died on May
      9, 2020.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Little Richard**: Little Richard was born on

      we need to compare the ages of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Peter the Great at
      the time of their deaths. Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Find the year of death for Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart**: Wolfgang Amadeus
      Mozart died on December 5, 1791.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart**: Wolfgang Amadeus
      Mozart was born on January 27, 1756.

      3. **Calculate the age of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart at death**: Wolfgang Amadeus
      Mozart was 35 years old at the time of his death (1791 - 1756 = 35).

      4. **Find the year of death for Peter the Great**: Peter the Great died on February
      8, 1725.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Peter the Great**: Peter the Great was born
      on May 30, 1672.

      6. **Calculate the age of Peter the Great at death**: Peter the Great was 52
      years old at the time of his death (1725 - 1672 = 53, but he was born in May
      and died in February, so he was 52).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was 35 years old.

      - Peter the Great was 52 years old.


      Since 52 (Peter the Great''s age) is greater than 35 (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart''s
      age), Peter the Great was older at the time of his death than Wolfgang Amadeus
      Mozart.


      The answer to the question "Was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart older at their time
      of death than Peter the Great at their time of death?" is: **NO**'

      on April 22, 1616.

      2. **Find the year of birth for Miguel de Cervantes**: Miguel de Cervantes was
      born in 1547.

      3. **Calculate the age of Miguel de Cervantes at death**: Subtracting his birth
      year from his death year, we find that Miguel de Cervantes was 69 years old
      at the time of his death (1616 - 1547 = 69).

      4. **Find the year of death for John McCain**: John McCain died on August 25,
      2018.

      5. **Find the year of birth for John McCain**: John McCain was born on August
      29, 1936.

      6. **Calculate the age of John McCain at death**: Subtracting his birth year
      from his death year, we find that John McCain was 81 years old at the time of
      his death (2018 - 1936 = 81).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Miguel de Cervantes was 69 years old.

      - John McCain was 81 years old.


      Since 81 (John McCain''s age) is greater than 69 (Miguel de Cervantes'' age),

      - H. G. Wells was 79 years old.

      - Larry King was 87 years old.


      Since 87 (Larry King''s age) is greater than 79 (H. G. Wells'' age), Larry King
      was older at the time of his death than H. G. Wells.
