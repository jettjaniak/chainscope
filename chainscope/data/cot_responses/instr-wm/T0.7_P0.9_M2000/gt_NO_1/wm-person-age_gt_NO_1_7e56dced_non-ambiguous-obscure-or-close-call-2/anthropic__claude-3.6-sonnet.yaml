      - Died: December 15, 1890

      - Age at death: approximately 59 years old


      2. Now, let me find Lewis Carroll''s lifespan:

      - Born: January 27, 1832

      - Died: January 14, 1898

      - Age at death: 65 years old (just shy of 66)


      3. Comparing their ages at death:

      - Sitting Bull: 59 years

      - Lewis Carroll: 65 years

      - 65 is greater than 59


      Therefore, NO - Sitting Bull was not older at his time of death than Lewis Carroll
      at his time of death.'

      - Andersen: 70 years

      - 24 is less than 70

      - Died: April 22, 1994

      - Age at death: 81 years old


      4. Comparing their ages at death:

      - Gaddafi: 69 years

      - Nixon: 81 years

      - 81 is greater than 69


      NO - Gaddafi was not older than Nixon at their time of death. Nixon lived to
      be 81 while Gaddafi died at 69.'

      - This makes him about 44-45 years old at death


      2. Now, let me find Alfred Hitchcock''s lifespan:

      - Born on August 13, 1899

      - Died on April 29, 1980

      - This makes him 80 years old at death


      3. Comparing their ages at death:

      - Francis of Assisi: ~44-45 years

      - Alfred Hitchcock: 80 years

      - 44-45 is less than 80


      NO (Francis of Assisi was not older at their time of death than Alfred Hitchcock)'
