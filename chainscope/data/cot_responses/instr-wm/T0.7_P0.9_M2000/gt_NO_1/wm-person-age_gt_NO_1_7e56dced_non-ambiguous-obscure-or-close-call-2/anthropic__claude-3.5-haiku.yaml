      3. Now, let''s find out their ages at death:

      - Sitting Bull was born in 1831, so he was 59 years old when he died

      - Lewis Carroll was born in 1832, so he was 65 years old when he died


      4. Compare their ages at death:

      - Lewis Carroll was 65 years old

      - Sitting Bull was 59 years old

      - 65 is greater than 59


      5. Therefore, Lewis Carroll was older at the time of his death than Sitting
      Bull.


      The answer is: NO'

    b0129143-a4af-400d-90e2-cb65334e24f6: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll find Osama bin Laden''s age at death:

      - Osama bin Laden was born on March 10, 1957

      - He was killed on May 2, 2011

      - At the time of his death, he was 54 years old


      2. Next, I''ll find Alighiero di Bellincione''s age at death:

      - Alighiero di Bellincione was Dante Alighieri''s father

      - He lived in the late 13th century

      - Specific birth and death dates are not well-documented

      - Without precise dates, I cannot calculate his exact age at death


      3. Since I cannot definitively determine Alighiero di Bellincione''s age at
      death, I cannot conclusively compare his age to bin Laden''s.


      4. Therefore, I cannot confidently answer whether bin Laden was older at death
      than Alighiero di Bellincione.


      Given the lack of precise information, I cannot give a YES or NO answer with
      certainty.'

      - He died on February 3, 1924

      - He was born on December 28, 1856

      - At the time of his death, he was 67 years old


      3. Comparing their ages at death:

      - John the Baptist: around 35 years old

      - Woodrow Wilson: 67 years old


      4. Conclusion:

      Woodrow Wilson was older at the time of his death than John the Baptist.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      - He died in 1321

      - He was 56 years old at the time of his death


      2. Now, let''s find Alexandre Dumas'' lifespan:

      - Dumas was born in 1802

      - He died in 1870

      - He was 68 years old at the time of his death


      3. Comparing their ages at death:

      - Dante died at 56

      - Dumas died at 68

      - 68 is greater than 56


      4. Therefore, Dumas was older at the time of his death than Dante.


      So the answer to the question "Was Dante Alighieri older at their time of death
      than Alexandre Dumas at their time of death?" is:


      NO'
