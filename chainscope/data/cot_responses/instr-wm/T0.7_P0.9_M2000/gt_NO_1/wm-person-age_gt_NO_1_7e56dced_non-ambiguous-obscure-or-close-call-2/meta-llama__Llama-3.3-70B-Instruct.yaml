      but since his birthday was in September and he died in January, he hadn''t had
      his birthday that year, so he was 76).

      was born on March 26, 1931, and he died on February 27, 2015. Therefore, he
      was 83 years old when he died.


      3. **Compare the ages at the time of death**: Now, we compare the ages of Bruce
      Lee (32 years old) and Leonard Nimoy (83 years old) at the time of their deaths
      to determine if Bruce Lee was older than Leonard Nimoy at their respective times
      of death.


      Given these steps, it''s clear that Bruce Lee was significantly younger than
      Leonard Nimoy at the time of their deaths.


      The answer is: **NO**'

      we need to know the ages of Che Guevara and Vasco da Gama at the time of their

      1. **Che Guevara''s Age at Death**: Che Guevara was born on June 14, 1928, and
      died on October 9, 1967. Therefore, he was 39 years old when he died.


      2. **Vasco da Gama''s Age at Death**: Vasco da Gama was born around 1469 and
      died on December 24, 1524. Therefore, he was approximately 55 years old when
      he died.


      Given these ages, we can compare them to determine if Che Guevara was older
      at the time of his death than Vasco da Gama was at the time of his death.


      Since 39 (Che Guevara''s age at death) is less than 55 (Vasco da Gama''s age

      1. Che Guevara was born on June 14, 1928, and died on October 9, 1967. To find
      his age at the time of death, we subtract his birth year from his death year:
      1967 - 1928 = 39 years. Since his death occurred in October and his birth in
      June, he was 39 years old at the time of death.


      2. Vasco da Gama was born around 1469 and died on December 24, 1524. The exact
      date of his birth is not certain, but it''s estimated to be around 1469. To
      find his age at the time of death, we subtract his estimated birth year from
      his death year: 1524 - 1469 = 55 years. Since his death occurred in December
      and assuming his birth was earlier in the year, he was approximately 55 years

      1. **Rajiv Gandhi''s Age at Death**: Rajiv Gandhi was born on August 20, 1944,
      and he died on May 21, 1991. Therefore, at the time of his death, Rajiv Gandhi
      was 46 years old.


      2. **Neil Armstrong''s Age at Death**: Neil Armstrong was born on August 5,
      1930, and he died on August 25, 2012. Therefore, at the time of his death, Neil
      Armstrong was 82 years old.


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Rajiv Gandhi was 46 years old when he died.

      - Neil Armstrong was 82 years old when he died.


      Since 46 (Rajiv Gandhi''s age at death) is less than 82 (Neil Armstrong''s age
      at death), Rajiv Gandhi was not older at the time of his death than Neil Armstrong
      at the time of his death.

      during a flight around the world. Although her body was never found, she was
      declared dead by the Superior Court of Los Angeles County on January 5, 1939.
      Assuming she died around the time of her disappearance, she would have been

      battle with stomach cancer. At the time of his death, he was 72 years old.


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - Amelia Earhart was approximately 39-40 years old.

      - John Wayne was 72 years old.

      Step 1: Amelia Earhart''s age at the time of her death.

      - Amelia Earhart was born on July 24, 1897.

      - She disappeared on July 2, 1937, during a flight around the world. It is presumed
      that she died shortly after disappearing.

      - Therefore, at the time of her presumed death, Amelia Earhart was 39 years

      Step 2: John Wayne''s age at the time of his death.

      - John Wayne was born on May 26, 1907.

      - He died on June 11, 1979.

      - Therefore, at the time of his death, John Wayne was 72 years old.

      2. To find his age at death, we calculate the difference between his birth year
      and death year: 1968 - 1925 = 43 years. Since his birthday is in November and
      he died in June, he was 42 years old at the time of his death.

      3. Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, and he was assassinated on January
      30, 1948.

      4. To find his age at death, we calculate the difference between his birth year
      and death year: 1948 - 1869 = 79 years. Since his birthday is in October and
      he died in January, he was 78 years old at the time of his death.


      Comparing their ages at the time of death: Robert F. Kennedy was 42 years old,
      and Mahatma Gandhi was 78 years old.


      Given this information, the answer to whether Robert F. Kennedy was older at
      their time of death than Mahatma Gandhi at their time of death is: NO'

      was 52 years old when she died.


      2. **Determine the age of Louis XIV of France at the time of his death**: Louis
      XIV was born on September 5, 1638, and died on September 1, 1715. Therefore,
      he was 76 years old when he died.


      3. **Compare the ages at the time of death**: Now, we compare the ages of Grace
      Kelly and Louis XIV at the time of their deaths to determine if Grace Kelly
      was older than Louis XIV when they died.


      Given that Grace Kelly was 52 years old at the time of her death and Louis XIV
      was 76 years old at the time of his death, it is clear that Louis XIV was older
      than Grace Kelly when they died.

      1. **Find the age of Louis XIV at the time of death**: Louis XIV was born on

      let''s first gather the necessary information about the ages of Emily Dickinson
      and Walter Cronkite at the time of their deaths.


      1. **Emily Dickinson''s birth and death dates**: Emily Dickinson was born on
      December 10, 1830, and died on May 15, 1886.

      2. **Walter Cronkite''s birth and death dates**: Walter Cronkite was born on
      November 4, 1916, and died on July 17, 2009.


      Now, calculate the age of each at the time of death:


      - **Emily Dickinson''s age at death**: From December 10, 1830, to May 15, 1886,
      Emily Dickinson was 55 years old when she died.

      - **Walter Cronkite''s age at death**: From November 4, 1916, to July 17, 2009,
      Walter Cronkite was 92 years old when he died.


      Comparing their ages at the time of death: Emily Dickinson was 55 years old,
      and Walter Cronkite was 92 years old.


      Since 55 is less than 92, Emily Dickinson was not older than Walter Cronkite

      1. First, let''s determine the year and age of Frida Kahlo''s death. Frida Kahlo
      was born on July 6, 1907, and she died on July 13, 1954. So, she was 47 years
      old at the time of her death.


      2. Next, we''ll determine the year and age of Pablo Picasso''s death. Pablo
      Picasso was born on October 25, 1881, and he died on April 8, 1973. So, he was
      91 years old at the time of his death.


      3. Now, we compare the ages of Frida Kahlo (47 years old) and Pablo Picasso
      (91 years old) at the time of their deaths to answer the question.

      we need to determine the age of Ferdinand Marcos and Robert Kennedy at the time
      of their deaths.


      1. **Ferdinand Marcos''s Age at Death**: Ferdinand Marcos was born on September
      11, 1917, and died on September 28, 1989. Therefore, he was 72 years old when
      he died.


      2. **Robert Kennedy''s Age at Death**: Robert Kennedy was born on November 20,
      1925, and died on June 6, 1968. Therefore, he was 42 years old when he died.


      Comparing their ages at the time of death: 72 years (Ferdinand Marcos) vs. 42
      years (Robert Kennedy).


      Given the comparison, Ferdinand Marcos was indeed older at the time of his death
      than Robert Kennedy was at his time of death.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      we need to follow these steps:


      1. Determine the age of Friedrich Nietzsche at the time of his death.

      2. Determine the age of Indira Gandhi at the time of her death.

      3. Compare these ages to determine if Nietzsche was older than Gandhi at their
      respective times of death.


      Step 1: Friedrich Nietzsche was born on October 15, 1844, and died on August
      25, 1900. To calculate his age at death, we subtract his birth year from his
      death year and then consider the months. Since he died before his birthday in
      the year of his death, we do not add 1 to the year difference. Therefore, Nietzsche
      was 55 years old when he died.


      Step 2: Indira Gandhi was born on November 19, 1917, and died on October 31,
      1984. Using the same logic as above, we calculate her age at death by subtracting
      her birth year from her death year. Since she died before her birthday in the
      year of her death, we do not add 1. Therefore, Indira Gandhi was 66 years old
      when she died.


      Step 3: Comparing the ages at death, Nietzsche was 55 years old, and Gandhi
      was 66 years old. Therefore, Nietzsche was not older than Gandhi at their respective
      times of death.


      The final answer is: NO'

      we need to compare the ages of Antonio Vivaldi and Harry S. Truman at the time
      of their deaths.


      Step 1: Determine the birth and death dates of Antonio Vivaldi.

      - Antonio Vivaldi was born on March 4, 1678.

      - Antonio Vivaldi died on July 28, 1741.


      Step 2: Calculate the age of Antonio Vivaldi at the time of death.

      - Vivaldi died at the age of 63.


      Step 3: Determine the birth and death dates of Harry S. Truman.

      - Harry S. Truman was born on May 8, 1884.

      - Harry S. Truman died on December 26, 1972.


      Step 4: Calculate the age of Harry S. Truman at the time of death.

      - Truman died at the age of 88.


      Step 5: Compare the ages of Antonio Vivaldi and Harry S. Truman at the time
      of their deaths.

      - Vivaldi was 63 years old at the time of his death.

      - Truman was 88 years old at the time of his death.


      Since 63 (Vivaldi''s age at death) is less than 88 (Truman''s age at death),
      Vivaldi was not older than Truman at the time of their deaths.


      The answer is: NO'

      we need to determine the ages of Saddam Hussein and Thomas Jefferson at the
      time of their deaths.


      1. **Saddam Hussein''s age at death**: Saddam Hussein was born on April 28,
      1937, and he died on December 30, 2006. Therefore, he was 69 years old when
      he died.


      2. **Thomas Jefferson''s age at death**: Thomas Jefferson was born on April
      13, 1743, and he died on July 4, 1826. Therefore, he was 83 years old when he
      died.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death: Saddam Hussein was 69 years
      old, and Thomas Jefferson was 83 years old.


      Since 69 is less than 83, Saddam Hussein was not older than Thomas Jefferson
      at the time of their deaths.

      we need to compare the ages of William Wallace and Elizabeth I at the time of
      their deaths.


      1. **Determine the year of death and age at death for William Wallace**: William
      Wallace was executed on August 23, 1305. His exact date of birth is not known
      with certainty, but it is believed to be around 1270-1276. Assuming an average
      of these years (1273) as his birth year for the sake of estimation, he would
      have been approximately 32 years old at the time of his death.


      2. **Determine the year of death and age at death for Elizabeth I of England**:
      Elizabeth I died on March 24, 1603. She was born on September 7, 1533. Therefore,
      she was 69 years old at the time of her death.


      3. **Compare their ages at death**: William Wallace was approximately 32 years
      old when he died, while Elizabeth I was 69 years old when she died.


      Based on the comparison, it''s clear that Elizabeth I was significantly older
      than William Wallace at the time of their respective deaths.


      The answer to whether William Wallace was older at their time of death than
      Elizabeth I of England at their time of death is: **NO**.'
    43cc7d58-f66a-43fa-9963-cd92733a9320: '<think></think>To answer this question,
      we need to compare the ages of William Wallace and Elizabeth I of England at
      the time of their deaths. Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


      1. **Find the year of death for William Wallace**: William Wallace was executed
      on August 23, 1305.

      2. **Find the year of birth for William Wallace**: The exact date of birth for
      William Wallace is not known with certainty, but it is believed to be around
      1270-1276. For the purpose of this comparison, let''s use the range 1270-1276.

      3. **Calculate the age of William Wallace at death**: Assuming the birth year
      range, if we take the earliest birth year (1270), he would be approximately
      35 years old at the time of death (1305 - 1270 = 35). If we take the latest
      birth year (1276), he would be approximately 29 years old (1305 - 1276 = 29).
      So, his age at death could have been between 29 and 35 years old.

      4. **Find the year of death for Elizabeth I of England**: Elizabeth I died on
      March 24, 1603.

      5. **Find the year of birth for Elizabeth I of England**: Elizabeth I was born
      on September 7, 1533.

      6. **Calculate the age of Elizabeth I at death**: Elizabeth I was 69 years old
      at the time of her death (1603 - 1533 = 69).


      Now, comparing the ages at the time of death:

      - William Wallace was between 29 and 35 years old.

      - Elizabeth I was 69 years old.


      Since 69 (Elizabeth I''s age) is greater than both 29 and 35 (the possible ages
      for William Wallace), Elizabeth I was older at the time of her death than William
      Wallace.


      The answer to the question "Was William Wallace older at their time of death
      than Elizabeth I of England at their time of death?" is: **NO**.'

      Wallace was older at the time of his death than Elizabeth I of England at the
      time of her death, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Find the birth and death years for William Wallace**: William Wallace was
      born around 1270 and died in 1305.

      2. **Calculate William Wallace''s age at death**: 1305 - 1270 = 35 years old.

      3. **Find the birth and death years for Elizabeth I of England**: Elizabeth
      I was born in 1533 and died in 1603.

      4. **Calculate Elizabeth I''s age at death**: 1603 - 1533 = 70 years old.

      5. **Compare their ages at death**: William Wallace was 35 years old, and Elizabeth
      I was 70 years old at the time of their deaths.


      Given these calculations, we can conclude that William Wallace was not older
      than Elizabeth I at the time of their deaths.

      1. **Ho Chi Minh''s Age at Death**: Ho Chi Minh was born on May 19, 1890, and
      died on September 2, 1969. To find his age at death, we calculate the difference
      between his birth year and death year, which gives us 79 years. However, since
      his birthday (May 19) had already passed in the year of his death, we can confirm
      he was 79 years old at the time of his death.


      2. **Rosa Parks'' Age at Death**: Rosa Parks was born on February 4, 1913, and
      died on October 24, 2005. Using a similar calculation as above, we find she
      was 92 years old at the time of her death, since her birthday (February 4) had
      passed in the year of her death.


      Now, comparing their ages at death:

      - Ho Chi Minh was 79 years old.

      we need to follow these steps:


      1. Determine the age of Osama bin Laden at the time of his death.

      2. Determine the age of Alighiero di Bellincione at the time of his death.

      3. Compare these ages to answer the question.


      Step 1: Osama bin Laden''s age at death.

      - Osama bin Laden was born on March 10, 1957.

      - He was killed on May 2, 2011.

      - Therefore, at the time of his death, Osama bin Laden was 54 years old.


      Step 2: Alighiero di Bellincione''s age at death.

      - Alighiero di Bellincione, also known as Alighiero Bellincione, was an Italian
      banker and the father of Dante Alighieri, the famous poet.

      - Alighiero di Bellincione was born around 1220.

      - The exact date of his death is not certain, but it is believed to be around
      1280 or possibly a bit later.

      - Assuming he died around 1280, and taking his birth year as 1220, Alighiero
      di Bellincione would have been approximately 60 years old at the time of his
      death.


      Step 3: Comparing the ages.

      - Osama bin Laden was 54 years old at the time of his death.

      - Alighiero di Bellincione was approximately 60 years old at the time of his
      death.

      - Since 54 (Osama bin Laden''s age) is less than 60 (Alighiero di Bellincione''s
      age), Osama bin Laden was not older than Alighiero di Bellincione at the time
      of their respective deaths.

      we need to follow these steps:


      1. Determine the age of Arthur Conan Doyle at the time of his death.

      2. Determine the age of John Paul II at the time of his death.

      3. Compare these ages to answer the question.


      Step 1: Arthur Conan Doyle was born on May 22, 1859, and died on July 7, 1930.
      To find his age at the time of death, we calculate the difference between his
      year of death and his year of birth, which gives us 71 years. Since his birthday
      (May 22) had already passed when he died (July 7), he was indeed 71 years old
      at the time of his death.


      Step 2: John Paul II was born on May 18, 1920, and died on April 2, 2005. Calculating
      the difference between his year of death and his year of birth gives us 84 years.
      However, since his birthday (May 18) had not occurred yet when he died (April
      2), he was 84 years old at the time of his death, but to be precise in terms
      of completed years, he was still 84 because his next birthday was after his
      death, meaning he hadn''t completed 85 years.


      Step 3: Compare the ages. Arthur Conan Doyle was 71 years old at the time of
      his death, and John Paul II was 84 years old at the time of his death.


      Given these calculations, the answer to whether Arthur Conan Doyle was older
      at the time of death than John Paul II at the time of death is NO.'

      1. Arthur Conan Doyle was born on May 22, 1859, and died on July 7, 1930. We
      calculate his age at death: 1930 - 1859 = 71 years. Since his birthday was in

      1. **Heath Ledger''s Age at Death**: Heath Ledger died on January 22, 2008.
      He was born on April 4, 1979. Therefore, at the time of his death, Heath Ledger
      was 28 years old.


      2. **Franz Kafka''s Age at Death**: Franz Kafka died on June 3, 1924. He was
      born on July 3, 1883. Therefore, at the time of his death, Franz Kafka was 40
      years old.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death: Heath Ledger was 28 years old,
      and Franz Kafka was 40 years old.


      Since 28 is less than 40, Heath Ledger was not older than Franz Kafka at the
      time of their respective deaths.


      The answer is: **NO**'

      1. **Find the age of Heath Ledger at his time of death**: Heath Ledger was born
      on April 4, 1979, and he died on January 22, 2008. This means he was 28 years
      old when he died.


      2. **Find the age of Franz Kafka at his time of death**: Franz Kafka was born
      on July 3, 1883, and he died on June 3, 1924. This means he was 40 years old
      when he died.


      3. **Compare the ages**: Now, we compare the ages of both individuals at the
      time of their death to answer the question. Heath Ledger was 28 years old, and
      Franz Kafka was 40 years old.


      Given these steps, the answer to whether Heath Ledger was older at his time
      of death than Franz Kafka at his time of death is: **NO**'

      President of the United States and died on February 3, 1924. He was born on
      December 28, 1856, which makes him 67 years old at the time of his death.


      3. **Compare the Ages**: Now, comparing the ages at death, John the Baptist
      was approximately 33-34 years old, while Woodrow Wilson was 67 years old.


      Based on this comparison, the answer to whether John the Baptist was older at
      their time of death than Woodrow Wilson at their time of death is: **NO**.'

      let''s break down the steps needed:


      1. **Determine the age of John the Baptist at his time of death**: According
      to historical and biblical accounts, John the Baptist was beheaded, and his
      age at death is not directly stated in the Bible. However, it''s traditionally
      believed that he was about 30-32 years old when he died, given that Jesus Christ
      was baptized by John and started his ministry around the age of 30, and considering
      the time John spent preaching before Jesus'' baptism.


      2. **Determine the age of Woodrow Wilson at his time of death**: Woodrow Wilson,
      the 28th President of the United States, died on February 3, 1924. He was born
      on December 28, 1856, which means he was 67 years old when he died.


      3. **Compare the ages**: Now, we need to compare the ages of John the Baptist
      and Woodrow Wilson at their times of death. John the Baptist is believed to
      have been around 30-32 years old, while Woodrow Wilson was 67 years old.


      Given these steps, we can conclude that John the Baptist was significantly younger
      at his time of death than Woodrow Wilson was at his.


      The answer is: **NO**'

      \ the question refers to his age at a given point in time. Since Jimmy Carter\

      \ time of death than Jimmy Carter at their time of death, and considering Jimmy\
      \ Carter is still alive and thus has not reached \"their time of death,\" we\
      \ must consider the scenario where Jimmy Carter's age at death is being hypothetically\

      \ (Ali ibn Abi Talib) was a cousin and son-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\

      \ he is still alive. However, for the purpose of this comparison, we'll consider\
      \ his age at the time of the question and project it to his potential time of\
      \ death, assuming it hasn't happened yet.\n\n2. **Calculate the age of Al\u012B\
      \ ibn Ab\u012B \u1E6C\u0101lib at death:**\n   - Born in 601 AD and died in\
      \ 661 AD, Al\u012B ibn Ab\u012B \u1E6C\u0101lib was approximately 60 years old\
      \ when he died.\n\n3. **Consider Jimmy Carter's age:**\n   - As Jimmy Carter\
      \ is still alive (as of my last update), we cannot determine his exact age at\
      \ death. However, to make a comparison, we must consider that for Jimmy Carter\
      \ to be younger than Al\u012B ibn Ab\u012B \u1E6C\u0101lib at their respective\
      \ times of death, he would need to die before reaching the age of 60. Given\
      \ Jimmy Carter's birth year (1924), and considering the time this question is\
      \ being evaluated (assuming it's after 2024), it's highly likely Jimmy Carter\

      \ time of his death.\n\n2. **Determine the status of Jimmy Carter.** As of my\
      \ last update, Jimmy Carter is still alive, born on October 1, 1924. Since he\
      \ is alive, we cannot directly compare his age at death to Al\u012B ibn Ab\u012B\
      \ \u1E6C\u0101lib's age at death. However, the question asks us to compare their\
      \ ages at the time of death, so we need to consider Jimmy Carter's current age\
      \ and project it into the future. But to directly answer the question as it's\
      \ framed, we must acknowledge that Jimmy Carter, being still alive, does not\
      \ have an \"age at death\" to compare.\n\n3. **Consideration for comparison.**\
      \ Given that Jimmy Carter is still alive, the question seems to imply a hypothetical\

      \ it's clear he has already surpassed the age of 60.\n\n4. **Direct Answer Based\
      \ on Information Given.** Since Jimmy Carter is still alive and has already\
      \ surpassed the age of 60, and considering the question asks for a comparison\
      \ at the time of death, the premise of the question is somewhat flawed because\
      \ it assumes a future event (Jimmy Carter's death) without specifying an age\

      \ question seems to be about comparing ages at death, and acknowledging the\
      \ peculiar situation with Jimmy Carter still being alive, the most straightforward\
      \ answer without complicating the logic further would be based on the fact that\

      we need to follow these steps:


      1. Determine the age of Catherine II of Russia at her time of death.

      2. Determine the age of Robert Mugabe at his time of death.

      3. Compare these two ages to answer the question.


      Step 1: Catherine II of Russia was born on May 2, 1729, and died on November
      17, 1796. To find her age at death, we calculate the difference between her
      year of death and her year of birth: 1796 - 1729 = 67 years. Since her birthday
      (May 2) had already passed in the year of her death (November 17), she was 67
      years old at the time of her death.


      Step 2: Robert Mugabe was born on February 21, 1924, and died on September 6,
      2019. To find his age at death, we calculate the difference between his year
      of death and his year of birth: 2019 - 1924 = 95 years. Since his birthday (February
      21) had already passed in the year of his death (September 6), he was 95 years
      old at the time of his death.


      Step 3: Now, we compare the ages of Catherine II of Russia (67 years old) and
      Robert Mugabe (95 years old) at their times of death. Robert Mugabe was older
      than Catherine II of Russia at their respective times of death.


      Given the question asks if Catherine II of Russia was older at her time of death

      we need to follow these steps:


      1. Determine the age of John Lennon at his time of death.

      2. Determine the age of Charles Darwin at his time of death.

      3. Compare the two ages to see if John Lennon was older.


      Step 1: John Lennon was born on October 9, 1940, and died on December 8, 1980.
      So, at the time of his death, John Lennon was 40 years old.


      Step 2: Charles Darwin was born on February 12, 1809, and died on April 19,
      1882. So, at the time of his death, Charles Darwin was 73 years old.


      Step 3: Comparing the two ages, 40 (John Lennon''s age at death) is less than
      73 (Charles Darwin''s age at death).


      Based on the comparison, the answer to whether John Lennon was older at their
      time of death than Charles Darwin at their time of death is: NO.'

      we need to compare the ages of Henri Matisse and Nelson Mandela at the time
      of their deaths.


      1. First, we need to find out when Henri Matisse died and how old he was at
      that time. Henri Matisse was born on December 31, 1869, and died on November
      3, 1954. So, we calculate his age at death: 1954 - 1869 = 85 years old.


      2. Next, we do the same for Nelson Mandela. Nelson Mandela was born on July
      18, 1918, and died on December 5, 2013. So, we calculate his age at death: 2013
      - 1918 = 95 years old.


      3. Now, we compare the ages at death: Henri Matisse was 85 years old, and Nelson
      Mandela was 95 years old.


      Given this comparison, the question asks if Henri Matisse was older at the time
      of death than Nelson Mandela. Since 85 (Matisse''s age) is less than 95 (Mandela''s

      we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Determine the year of death for C. S. Lewis**: Clive Staples Lewis, known
      as C. S. Lewis, died on November 22, 1963.

      2. **Determine the age of C. S. Lewis at the time of death**: C. S. Lewis was
      born on November 29, 1898, which means he was 64 years old when he died.

      3. **Determine the year of death for Carl Jung**: Carl Gustav Jung died on June
      6, 1961.

      4. **Determine the age of Carl Jung at the time of death**: Carl Jung was born
      on July 26, 1875, which means he was 85 years old when he died.

      5. **Compare the ages at the time of death**: Now, we compare the ages of C.
      S. Lewis (64 years old) and Carl Jung (85 years old) at the time of their deaths
      to determine if C. S. Lewis was older than Carl Jung at their respective times
      of death.


      Based on these steps, since 64 (C. S. Lewis''s age at death) is less than 85
      (Carl Jung''s age at death), C. S. Lewis was not older than Carl Jung at their
      times of death.

      Step 2: Walt Disney was born on December 5, 1901, and died on December 15, 1966.
      To find his age at death, we subtract his birth year from his death year: 1966
      - 1901 = 65 years. Since his birthday is in December and he died in December,
      he was 65 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 3: Comparing the ages, Peter I was 52 years old at his death, and Walt
      Disney was 65 years old at his death.


      Based on this comparison, the answer is: NO'

      \nSince 78 (Idi Amin's age at death) is less than 87 (Little Richard's age at\
      \ death), Idi Amin was not older than Little Richard at the time of their respective\
      \ deaths.\n\n**Answer: NO**"

      1. **Find the age of Judy Garland at her time of death**: Judy Garland was born
      on June 10, 1922, and she died on June 22, 1969. So, she was 47 years old when
      she died.


      2. **Find the age of Leonardo da Vinci at his time of death**: Leonardo da Vinci
      was born on April 15, 1452, and he died on May 2, 1519. So, he was 67 years
      old when he died.


      3. **Compare the ages**: Now, we compare the ages of Judy Garland (47 years
      old) and Leonardo da Vinci (67 years old) at the time of their deaths to determine
      if Judy Garland was older than Leonardo da Vinci at their respective times of
      death.


      Based on the comparison, since 47 (Judy Garland''s age) is less than 67 (Leonardo
      da Vinci''s age), Judy Garland was not older than Leonardo da Vinci at their
      time of death.


      The answer is: **NO**'

      we need to determine the ages of Judy Garland and Leonardo da Vinci at the time
      of their deaths.


      1. First, we find out when Judy Garland died and how old she was. Judy Garland
      died on June 22, 1969. She was born on June 10, 1922, which means she was 47
      years old when she died.


      2. Next, we determine when Leonardo da Vinci died and how old he was. Leonardo
      da Vinci died on May 2, 1519. He was born on April 15, 1452, which means he
      was 67 years old when he died.


      3. Now, we compare their ages at the time of death. Judy Garland was 47 years
      old, and Leonardo da Vinci was 67 years old.


      Since 47 is less than 67, Judy Garland was not older than Leonardo da Vinci
      at the time of their deaths.


      The answer is: NO'

      1. **Find the age of Judy Garland at the time of her death**: Judy Garland was
      born on June 10, 1922, and died on June 22, 1969. Therefore, she was 47 years
      old when she died.


      2. **Find the age of Leonardo da Vinci at the time of his death**: Leonardo
      da Vinci was born on April 15, 1452, and died on May 2, 1519. Therefore, he
      was 67 years old when he died.


      3. **Compare the ages at the time of death**: Now, we compare the age of Judy
      Garland (47 years) at her death with the age of Leonardo da Vinci (67 years)
      at his death.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since 47 is less than 67, Judy Garland was younger at the
      time of her death than Leonardo da Vinci was at the time of his death.


      Given the question asks if Judy Garland was older at the time of her death than
      Leonardo da Vinci at the time of his death, the answer is:

      2. Determine the age of Muhammad Ali at the time of his death.

      3. Compare these two ages to answer the question.


      Step 1: Heinrich Himmler was born on October 7, 1900, and died on May 23, 1945.

      we''ll need to determine the ages of William Shakespeare and Akira Kurosawa
      at the time of their deaths.


      1. William Shakespeare was born in 1564 and died in 1616. To find his age at
      death, we subtract his birth year from his death year: 1616 - 1564 = 52. So,
      William Shakespeare was 52 years old when he died.


      2. Akira Kurosawa was born in 1910 and died in 1998. To find his age at death,
      we subtract his birth year from his death year: 1998 - 1910 = 88. So, Akira
      Kurosawa was 88 years old when he died.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death: William Shakespeare was 52 years
      old, and Akira Kurosawa was 88 years old.


      Since 52 is less than 88, William Shakespeare was not older than Akira Kurosawa
      at the time of their deaths.


      The answer is: NO'

      on August 13, 1946. To find his age, we subtract his birth year from his death
      year: 1946 - 1866 = 80 years. Since his birthday (September 21) had not yet
      occurred in the year of his death, he was 79 years old at the time of his death.


      4. **Calculate the age of Larry King at the time of death**: Larry King died
      on January 23, 2021. To find his age, we subtract his birth year from his death
      year: 2021 - 1933 = 88 years. Since his birthday (November 19) had not yet occurred
      in the year of his death, he was 87 years old at the time of his death.


      5. **Compare the ages at death**: H.G. Wells was 79 years old when he died,
      and Larry King was 87 years old when he died.


      Given these calculations, the question asks if H.G. Wells was older at their
      time of death than Larry King at their time of death.


      The answer is: **NO**'

      we need to compare the ages of H.G. Wells and Larry King at the time of their
      deaths.


      1. First, let''s find out when H.G. Wells died and how old he was. H.G. Wells
      was born on September 21, 1866, and died on August 13, 1946. So, he was 79 years
      old when he died.


      2. Next, we''ll do the same for Larry King. Larry King was born on November
      19, 1933, and died on January 23, 2021. So, he was 87 years old when he died.


      3. Now, we compare their ages at the time of death. H.G. Wells was 79 years
      old, and Larry King was 87 years old.


      Since 79 is less than 87, H.G. Wells was not older than Larry King at the time
      of their deaths.
