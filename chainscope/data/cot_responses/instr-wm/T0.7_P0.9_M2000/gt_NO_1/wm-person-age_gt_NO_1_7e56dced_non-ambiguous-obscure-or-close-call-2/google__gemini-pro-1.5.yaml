      Bruce Lee even though he died later.  We need more information.


      Without knowing their birth dates, we can''t be certain.  However, it''s highly
      improbable that Bruce Lee, who died in 1973, was older at the time of his death
      than Leonard Nimoy, who died in 2015.  It''s possible, but extremely unlikely.

      later.  Someone who dies later will necessarily be older (or at least the same
      age) at their time of death.

      4. **Compare:**  Aaron died later, therefore he was older at the time of his
      death than Dostoyevsky.

      in 1616.  He was baptized on April 26, 1564, and his birth date is traditionally
      observed as April 23, 1564. Assuming he died in 1616 at age 52 (approximately),
      we can work backward from 1616 to estimate his birth year as around 1564.

      4. **Determine Kurosawa''s lifespan based on his date of death:** Kurosawa was
      born March 23, 1910, and died September 6, 1998.  This makes him 88 years old
      at the time of his death.


      5. **Compare their ages at death:** Shakespeare was approximately 52 when he
      died, and Kurosawa was 88 when he died.
