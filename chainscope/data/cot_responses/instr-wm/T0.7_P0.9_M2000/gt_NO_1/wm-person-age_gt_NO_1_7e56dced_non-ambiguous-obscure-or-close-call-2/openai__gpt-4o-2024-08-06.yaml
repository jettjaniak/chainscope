      1. Friedrich Nietzsche was born on October 15, 1844, and died on August 25,
      1900. Therefore, he was 55 years old at the time of his death.


      2. Indira Gandhi was born on November 19, 1917, and died on October 31, 1984.
      Therefore, she was 66 years old at the time of her death.


      Now we compare their ages at the time of death:

      - Friedrich Nietzsche was 55 years old.

      - Indira Gandhi was 66 years old.


      Indira Gandhi was older at the time of her death than Friedrich Nietzsche.
