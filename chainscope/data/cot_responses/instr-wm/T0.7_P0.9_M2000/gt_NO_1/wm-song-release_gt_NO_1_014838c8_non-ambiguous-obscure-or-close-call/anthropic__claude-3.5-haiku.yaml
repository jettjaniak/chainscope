      - It was later re-released in 1998 for the FIFA World Cup


      2. Next, let''s find the release date of T-Pain''s "Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin'')":

      - This song was released in 2007


      3. Comparing the two release dates:

      - "Three Lions" was released in 1996/1998

      - "Buy U a Drank" was released in 2007


      4. Determining which came later:

      - 2007 is later than 1996/1998


      Therefore, the answer is: YES, The Lightning Seeds''s "Three Lions" was released
      earlier than T-Pain''s "Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin'')".'
