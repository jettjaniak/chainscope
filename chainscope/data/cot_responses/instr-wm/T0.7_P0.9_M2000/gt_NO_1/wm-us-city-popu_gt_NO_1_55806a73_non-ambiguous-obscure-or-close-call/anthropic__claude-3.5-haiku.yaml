    ee6a88ab-8035-4d9b-9de7-e465b5733d05: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s consider Yosemite Valley:

      - Yosemite Valley is a specific geographic area within Yosemite National Park

      - It is a natural landscape, not a city

      - It does not have a permanent residential population

      - Its population is essentially zero


      2. Now, let''s consider Phoenix:

      - Phoenix is a major city in Arizona

      - It is the capital and most populous city in Arizona

      - As of 2021, Phoenix has approximately 1.6 million residents

      - It is the 5th most populous city in the United States


      3. Comparing the two:

      - Yosemite Valley has zero population

      - Phoenix has 1.6 million residents


      4. Conclusion:

      Yosemite Valley is NOT more populous than Phoenix.
