      We need information on the area of Central Area, Singapore and Tokyo.

      2. **Compare the areas:**  We need to find the area of both locations and compare
      them.

      3. **Determine the answer:** If Central Area, Singapore has a smaller area than
      Tokyo, the answer is YES. Otherwise, the answer is NO.


      Central Area, Singapore is a region *within* Singapore.  Singapore as a whole
      is much smaller than Tokyo.  Therefore, Central Area must also be smaller than
      Tokyo.


      Answer: YES

    d715d6fd-141e-4321-b694-d11f5fc0848a: '<think></think>1. **Identify the entities:**
      We need information about the area of Central Area, Singapore and Tokyo.

      2. **Find the area of Central Area, Singapore:**  Central Area is a planning
      region, not an official area with a defined size.  It''s part of the Central
      Region of Singapore. We need the area of the *Central Region* or ideally the
      rough area considered "Central Area" if that''s available from a reliable source.  This
      will be difficult to pinpoint precisely.

      3. **Find the area of Tokyo:** Tokyo is a large metropolitan area. We need the
      area of Tokyo Metropolis (which includes urban and rural areas).

      4. **Compare the areas:** Once we have the approximate area of Central Area/Central
      Region, Singapore and the area of Tokyo Metropolis, we can compare them.


      Since Central Area/Central Region is a part of Singapore, a small island nation,
      and Tokyo Metropolis is a massive metropolitan area, it is highly probable that
      Central Area/Region in Singapore is smaller than Tokyo.


      **Answer: YES**
