      Step 1: Understand what is being compared.

      We are comparing the area (size) of two places:

      - Mumbai City district (part of Mumbai, India)

      - Rio de Janeiro (a city in Brazil)


      Step 2: Define the areas accurately.

      - Mumbai City district refers specifically to the southern part of the city
      of Mumbai. It is also known as the "Island City," and it is distinct from the
      larger Mumbai suburban district.

      - Rio de Janeiro refers to the entire city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.


      Step 3: Look up or recall the approximate area sizes.

      - Mumbai City district area: approximately 69 square kilometers.

      - Rio de Janeiro city area: approximately 1,221 square kilometers.


      Step 4: Compare the two.

      - 69 sq km (Mumbai City) is much smaller than 1,221 sq km (Rio de Janeiro).

      - The city proper of Copenhagen covers approximately 86 square kilometers (33
      square miles).

      - If considering the entire Capital Region of Denmark (which includes surrounding

      - Philadelphia County covers an area of approximately 143 square miles (370
      square kilometers).


      Step 3: Estimate or find the area of Punjab.

      - Punjab, India covers an area of approximately 50,362 square kilometers (about
      19,445 square miles).


      Step 4: Compare the two areas.

      - 370 square kilometers (Philadelphia County) is much smaller than 50,362 square
