      1. First, I''ll clarify what "Central Area" means in Singapore:

      - This refers to the central business district (CBD) of Singapore


      2. Let''s consider the area of Singapore''s Central Area:

      - The CBD is relatively compact

      - It covers approximately 4-5 square kilometers


      3. Now, let''s consider Tokyo''s area:

      - Tokyo is a massive metropolitan area

      - The entire Tokyo Metropolis covers about 2,194 square kilometers

      - Even Tokyo''s central districts are much larger than Singapore''s CBD


      4. Comparing the two:

      - Singapore''s Central Area is just a few square kilometers

      - Tokyo''s area is hundreds of times larger


      5. Therefore, Singapore''s Central Area is MUCH smaller than Tokyo''s area.


      The answer is: YES (Central Area, Singapore has a smaller area than Tokyo)'

      1. First, let''s understand what "Central Area" means in Singapore:

      - This refers to the central region of Singapore

      - It''s an administrative district in the city-state


      2. Let''s look at the areas:

      - Singapore''s total land area is about 728 square kilometers

      - The Central Area is a subset of Singapore''s total area, so it will be much
      smaller


      3. Compare with Tokyo:

      - Tokyo is a large metropolitan area

      - Tokyo''s total area is about 2,194 square kilometers


      4. Reasoning about the Central Area:

      - The Central Area is just the central business and administrative district
      of Singapore

      - It would be a small fraction of Singapore''s total land area

      - Therefore, it must be much smaller than Tokyo''s total area


      5. Conclusion:

      - The Central Area of Singapore is definitely smaller than Tokyo''s total area

      1. Medina is a city located in Saudi Arabia

      - It is a relatively small city in geographical area


      2. Java is an island in Indonesia

      - Java is actually one of the most populous islands in the world

      - It has a total land area of approximately 138,794 square kilometers


      3. Comparing the areas:

      - Medina city itself is much smaller than Java island

      - The entire area of Medina city is around 600-700 square kilometers

      - Java island is around 138,794 square kilometers
