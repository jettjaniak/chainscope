      area.


      2. **Find the area of the Community of Madrid**: The Community of Madrid, also
      known as the Madrid Region, is an autonomous community in Spain. It includes
      the city of Madrid and its surrounding areas. The area of the Community of Madrid
      is approximately 8,028 square kilometers (3,100 square miles).


      3. **Compare the areas**: Given that the area of Punta Cana is not a precisely
      defined administrative area, it''s challenging to provide an exact comparison.
      However, considering the size of the Community of Madrid (8,028 square kilometers),
      it''s likely that Punta Cana''s area is smaller.


      Since Punta Cana is a coastal region with resorts and beaches, its area is likely
      to be smaller than the Community of Madrid, which encompasses the city of Madrid
      and its surrounding areas.

      1. **Find the area of Capri**: Capri is an island located in the Tyrrhenian
      Sea off the coast of Italy. Its area is approximately 10.4 square kilometers
      (or 4.0 square miles).


      2. **Find the area of River Nile (state)**: River Nile (state) refers to the
      Nile River and its surrounding area. The Nile River is the longest river in
      the world, extending through several countries in Africa. The area of River
      Nile (state) is significantly larger than that of Capri.
