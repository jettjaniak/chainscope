      we need to compare the areas of Punta Cana and the Community of Madrid.


      1. **Find the area of Punta Cana**: Punta Cana is a region located in the easternmost
      province of the Dominican Republic. It is known for its beautiful beaches and
      resorts. The exact area of Punta Cana may vary depending on the specific definition,
      but it generally refers to a coastal region and not a precise administrative
      area.


      2. **Find the area of the Community of Madrid**: The Community of Madrid, also
      known as the Madrid Region, is an autonomous community in Spain. It includes
      the city of Madrid and its surrounding areas. The area of the Community of Madrid
      is approximately 8,028 square kilometers (3,100 square miles).


      3. **Compare the areas**: Given that the area of Punta Cana is not a precisely
      defined administrative area, it''s challenging to provide an exact comparison.
      However, considering the size of the Community of Madrid (8,028 square kilometers),
      it''s likely that Punta Cana''s area is smaller.


      Since Punta Cana is a coastal region with resorts and beaches, its area is likely
      to be smaller than the Community of Madrid, which encompasses the city of Madrid
      and its surrounding areas.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      36,193 square kilometers (13,974 square miles).


      3. **Compare the areas**: Given the vast difference in size, with Easter Island
      covering an area of less than 164 square kilometers and Taiwan Province covering
      over 36,000 square kilometers, it''s evident that Easter Island has a significantly
      smaller area than Taiwan Province.

      we need to compare the areas of Capri and River Nile (state).


      1. **Find the area of Capri**: Capri is an island located in the Tyrrhenian
      Sea off the Sorrentine Peninsula, on the south side of the Gulf of Naples in
      the Campania region of Italy. Its area is approximately 10.4 square kilometers
      (4.0 square miles).


      2. **Find the area of River Nile (state)**: The River Nile state in Sudan covers
      an area of about 122,123 square kilometers (47,150 square miles).


      3. **Compare the areas**: Now, we compare the area of Capri (about 10.4 square
      kilometers) with the area of River Nile (state) (about 122,123 square kilometers).


      Given that 10.4 square kilometers is significantly less than 122,123 square
      kilometers, Capri indeed has a smaller area than River Nile (state).


      The answer is: **YES**'
