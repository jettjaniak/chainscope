      1. **Casablanca**: Casablanca is a city in Morocco. It is one of the largest
      cities in Morocco, both in terms of population and area. However, as a city,
      its area is limited compared to entire regions or emirates.


      2. **Emirate of Dubai**: Dubai is one of the seven emirates of the United Arab
      Emirates (UAE). As an emirate, it includes not only the city of Dubai but also
      surrounding regions, desert, and other areas, making it significantly larger
      than just a city.


      Now, comparing these:


      - The city of Casablanca covers an area of approximately 220 square kilometers
      (85 square miles).

      - The Emirate of Dubai covers an area of approximately 4,114 square kilometers

    f852cf18-f6f7-49bb-abac-bad4eb17aa3c: 'To answer this question, we need to compare
      the area of Capri with the area of River Nile (state).


      1. **Capri**: Capri is an island located in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the Sorrentine
      Peninsula, on the south side of the Gulf of Naples in Italy. It has an area
      of approximately 10.4 square kilometers.


      2. **River Nile (state)**: There is no state known as "River Nile" in common
      geographical terms. However, if we consider the Nile River itself, it is not
      a state but a river, and its length extends over 6,650 kilometers, flowing through
      multiple countries in northeastern Africa. The river does not have an area in
      the same way that a landmass does, so it is not directly comparable.


      Since there is no official state or land area referred to as "River Nile" that
      can be directly compared in area to Capri, the question as posed does not have
      a straightforward answer. However, if the question intended to compare Capri
      to a specific state or region named after the Nile River, such as a region in
      Sudan or Egypt, further information would be needed to make a comparison.


      Given the information available, the answer is NO, as there is no recognized
      state called "River Nile" to compare in terms of area with Capri.'
