      1. **Identify the Area of Easter Island**: Easter Island, which is a special
      territory of Chile, is known for its remote location in the Pacific Ocean. It
      has a total area of approximately 163.6 square kilometers (63.2 square miles).


      2. **Identify the Area of Taiwan Province, People''s Republic of China**: It''s
      crucial to note that the term "Taiwan Province, People''s Republic of China"
      can be somewhat confusing due to political sensitivities. However, if we''re
      referring to the administrative division known as Taiwan Province under the
      People''s Republic of China, it''s essential to understand that the PRC claims
      Taiwan as part of its territory, but the actual governance and internationally

      1. **Identify Coney Island and Bavaria**: Coney Island is a peninsula in Brooklyn,
      New York City, known for its amusement parks and beach. Bavaria, on the other
      hand, is a state (Bundesland) in southeastern Germany.


      2. **Determine the Area of Coney Island**: The exact area of Coney Island can
      vary depending on the definition of its boundaries. However, it is generally
      considered to be approximately 1.79 square miles (4.64 square kilometers) in
      area.


      3. **Determine the Area of Bavaria**: Bavaria is significantly larger, with

      comparison, considering Coney Island as a specific, smaller part of Brooklyn,
      let''s assume its area is significantly smaller than the entirety of Brooklyn.
      Coney Island''s area, more narrowly defined, could be estimated to be around
      3-4 square kilometers (1.2-1.5 square miles), though this can vary based on

      area of the River Nile state, presumably referring to the state or region through
      which the River Nile flows, which could be interpreted as the Nile Basin or
      a specific state like South Sudan''s Central Equatoria state, where the Nile
      flows, or a state in Egypt, but most likely referring to a larger geographic
      area or region associated with the Nile River.


      1. **Identify Capri''s Area**: Capri is a small island located in the Bay of
      Naples, Italy. Its area is approximately 10.4 square kilometers (about 4 square
      miles).


      2. **Identify the River Nile''s Associated Area**: The River Nile itself is
      a long, narrow watercourse, but when referring to a "state," we''re likely discussing
      a broader geographic or administrative region. For example, the Nile Basin,
      which encompasses parts of 11 countries, covers about 3,400,000 square kilometers
      (1,312,747 square miles). Even if we narrow it down to a smaller state or region
      directly associated with the Nile, such as South Sudan or parts of Egypt, these
      areas are still significantly larger than Capri.


      3. **Comparison**: Given that Capri is approximately 10.4 square kilometers
      and any region or state associated with the River Nile would be vastly larger
      (even a small state within the Nile Basin would be larger), it''s clear that
      Capri has a smaller area than any state or region directly associated with the
      River Nile.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'

      we need to compare the area of Capri, an island in Italy, with the area of the
      River Nile state, presumably referring to the states or countries through which
      the River Nile flows, but more likely referring to the South Sudan state of
      River Nile (also known as Northern State or Nile River State), or possibly the
      Egyptian governorate or other administrative divisions named after the Nile.
      However, for clarity and simplicity, if we consider a "River Nile state" as
      a reference to an administrative division directly named after the Nile, we''ll
      focus on a specific example like the Nile State in Sudan or the Nile Governorate
      in Egypt.


      1. **Identify Capri''s Area**: Capri is a small island located in the Gulf of
      Naples, Italy. Its total area is approximately 10.36 square kilometers (about
      4 square miles).


      2. **Identify the River Nile State''s Area**: For this example, let''s consider
      the Nile State in Sudan. The Nile State (also known as Northern State) in Sudan
      has an area of approximately 122,123 square kilometers (47,152 square miles).
      If we were to consider the Egyptian Nile Governorate or similar divisions, the
      comparison would still significantly favor the state''s larger size due to the
      vast difference in scale between a small island like Capri and any state or
      governorate.


      3. **Comparison**: Comparing the two areas, Capri with about 10.36 square kilometers
      versus the River Nile State with approximately 122,123 square kilometers, it''s
      clear that Capri has a significantly smaller area than the River Nile State.

      region or state through which the Nile River flows, such as the state of South
      Sudan, Sudan, or Egypt, which have significant portions of the Nile River).


      1. **Identify Capri**: Capri is an island located in the Gulf of Naples, Italy.

      2. **Determine the Area of Capri**: The total area of the island of Capri is
      approximately 10.36 square kilometers (about 4 square miles).


      3. **Identify River Nile (State)**: The question seems to refer to a "state"
      associated with the River Nile. Given the context, it''s logical to consider
      countries or regions through which the Nile River flows. The Nile River runs
      through 11 countries, including Egypt, Sudan, and South Sudan, among others.
      However, without a specific "state" named, we''ll consider the general area
      influenced by the Nile, which could encompass parts of these countries.


      4. **Determine the Area of the River Nile State**: The Nile Basin, which includes
      all the areas from which the Nile River collects water, covers approximately
      3,400,000 square kilometers (1,312,747 square miles). Even if we consider just
      one of the countries significantly associated with the Nile, such as Egypt,
      which has a total area of about 1,010,000 square kilometers (390,121 square
      miles), it''s still vastly larger than Capri.


      5. **Comparison**: Given that Capri has an area of about 10.36 square kilometers

      larger (in the millions of square kilometers), Capri indeed has a smaller area
      than any region or state associated with the River Nile.
