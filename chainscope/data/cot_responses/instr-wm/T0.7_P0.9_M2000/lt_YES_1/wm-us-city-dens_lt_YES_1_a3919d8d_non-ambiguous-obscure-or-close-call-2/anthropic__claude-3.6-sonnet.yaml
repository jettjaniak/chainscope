      1. First, I need to recall the population density of both cities:

      - Philadelphia: approximately 11,800 people per square mile

      - San Francisco: approximately 18,800 people per square mile


      2. To determine which is less densely populated, I need to compare these numbers:

      11,800 < 18,800


      3. Since Philadelphia''s population density (11,800) is less than San Francisco''s
      (18,800), Philadelphia is indeed less densely populated.


      YES'
