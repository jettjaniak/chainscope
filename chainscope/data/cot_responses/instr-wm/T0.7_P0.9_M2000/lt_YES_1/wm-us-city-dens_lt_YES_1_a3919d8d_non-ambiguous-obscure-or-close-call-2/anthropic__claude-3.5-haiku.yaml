      5. Since Boston''s population density (14,315) is higher than Seattle''s (8,973),
      Seattle is indeed less densely populated than Boston.

      - San Francisco: ~17,340 people/sq mile


      5. San Francisco has a higher population density than Philadelphia.

      - Yosemite Valley is located in Yosemite National Park

      - It is a protected natural area

      - It has very few permanent residents

      - Most people there are temporary visitors or park workers


      2. Now, let''s consider Nashville:

      - Nashville is a major city in Tennessee

      - It is a metropolitan area with a significant urban population

      - It has hundreds of thousands of residents within the city limits

      - The greater Nashville area has over 1.9 million people


      3. Comparing population density:

      - Yosemite Valley has essentially zero permanent residents

      - Nashville has a dense urban population
