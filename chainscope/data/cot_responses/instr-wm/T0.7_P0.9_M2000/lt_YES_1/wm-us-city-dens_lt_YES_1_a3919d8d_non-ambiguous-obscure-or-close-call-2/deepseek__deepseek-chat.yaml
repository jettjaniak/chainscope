    e228ee12-2fb0-42a0-8aba-80a957aa84b1: '<think></think>To determine whether Compton,
      CA is less densely populated than Washington, DC, we need to follow these steps:


      ### Step 1: Find the population and area of Compton, CA

      - **Population of Compton, CA**: Approximately 95,000 (as of recent estimates).

      - **Area of Compton, CA**: Approximately 10.1 square miles.


      ### Step 2: Calculate the population density of Compton, CA

      Population density is calculated as:

      \[ \text{Population Density} = \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Area}} \]

      \[ \text{Compton, CA Population Density} = \frac{95,000}{10.1} \approx 9,406
      \text{ people per square mile} \]


      ### Step 3: Find the population and area of Washington, DC

      - **Population of Washington, DC**: Approximately 700,000 (as of recent estimates).

      - **Area of Washington, DC**: Approximately 68.3 square miles.


      ### Step 4: Calculate the population density of Washington, DC

      \[ \text{Washington, DC Population Density} = \frac{700,000}{68.3} \approx 10,249
      \text{ people per square mile} \]


      ### Step 5: Compare the population densities

      - Compton, CA: ~9,406 people per square mile

      - Washington, DC: ~10,249 people per square mile


      ### Conclusion

      Yes, Compton, CA is less densely populated than Washington, DC.

      1. **Understand the context**: Yosemite Valley, CA, is a part of Yosemite National
      Park, a protected area known for its natural beauty and wilderness. It is not
      a traditional city but rather a small, sparsely populated area within the park.
      Nashville, TN, on the other hand, is a major city and the capital of Tennessee,
      with a significant urban population.


      2. **Population density**: Population density is calculated as the number of
      people per unit of area (usually square mile or square kilometer). Yosemite
      Valley has a very small permanent population, as most of the area is dedicated
      to tourism and conservation. Nashville, as a bustling city, has a much higher
      population density.


      3. **Compare the two**: Given that Yosemite Valley is a remote, protected area
      with minimal permanent residents, its population density is extremely low compared
      to Nashville, which is a densely populated urban center.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on this reasoning, Yosemite Valley, CA, is indeed less
