      Step 1: I need to find the population density of Dallas, TX.

      Dallas is a major Texas city with approximately 1.3 million people. It covers

      Step 2: Recall facts about Dallas, TX:

      - Dallas is a major city in Texas

      - It has a large population (over 1 million residents)

      - It covers a large geographic area

      - It has a mix of dense urban areas and more spread-out suburban areas


      Step 3: Recall facts about Beverly Hills, CA:

      - Beverly Hills is a small, wealthy city in Los Angeles County

      - It has a relatively small population (around 35,000 residents)

      - It covers a small geographic area

      - It''s known for large homes on spacious lots in many areas

      - Beverly Hills has approximately 6,000-6,500 people per square mile


      Beverly Hills, despite having larger homes and lots in some areas, is overall

      Austin has a population of approximately 950,000-1 million people and covers
      about 320-330 square miles. This gives Austin a population density of roughly
      3,000-3,100 people per square mile.


      Step 2: Let me recall the population density of Queens, NY.

      Queens has a population of approximately 2.3-2.4 million people and covers about
      109-112 square miles. This gives Queens a population density of roughly 21,000-22,000

      - San Diego''s land area is about 372 square miles

      - This gives San Diego a population density of roughly 3,800 people per square
      mile


      Step 2: Let me determine the population density of Miami, FL.

      - Miami has a population of approximately 450,000 people

      - Miami''s land area is about 36 square miles

      - This gives Miami a population density of roughly 12,500 people per square

      Step 3: Compare the two densities.

      - San Diego: ~3,800 people per square mile

      - Miami: ~12,500 people per square mile

      - 3,800 is less than 12,500


      Therefore, San Diego has a lower population density than Miami.
