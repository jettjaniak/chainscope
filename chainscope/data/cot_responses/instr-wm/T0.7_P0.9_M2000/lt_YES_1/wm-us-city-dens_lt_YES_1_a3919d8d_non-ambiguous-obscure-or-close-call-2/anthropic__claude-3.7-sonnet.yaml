      Step 1: I need to find the population density of Dallas, TX.

      Dallas is a major Texas city with approximately 1.3 million people. It covers

      Step 2: Recall facts about Dallas, TX:

      - Dallas is a major city in Texas

      - It has a large population (over 1 million residents)

      - It covers a large geographic area

      - It has a mix of dense urban areas and more spread-out suburban areas


      Step 3: Recall facts about Beverly Hills, CA:

      - Beverly Hills is a small, wealthy city in Los Angeles County

      - It has a relatively small population (around 35,000 residents)

      - It covers a small geographic area

      - It''s known for large homes on spacious lots in many areas

      - Beverly Hills has approximately 6,000-6,500 people per square mile


      Beverly Hills, despite having larger homes and lots in some areas, is overall
      more densely populated than Dallas. This is because Dallas includes more industrial

      Austin has a population of approximately 950,000-1 million people and covers
      about 320-330 square miles. This gives Austin a population density of roughly
      3,000-3,100 people per square mile.


      Step 2: Let me recall the population density of Queens, NY.

      Queens has a population of approximately 2.3-2.4 million people and covers about
      109-112 square miles. This gives Queens a population density of roughly 21,000-22,000

      - San Diego''s land area is about 372 square miles

      - This gives San Diego a population density of roughly 3,800 people per square
      mile


      Step 2: Let me determine the population density of Miami, FL.

      - Miami has a population of approximately 450,000 people

      - Miami''s land area is about 36 square miles

      - This gives Miami a population density of roughly 12,500 people per square

      Step 3: Compare the two densities.

      - San Diego: ~3,800 people per square mile

      - Miami: ~12,500 people per square mile

      - 3,800 is less than 12,500


      Therefore, San Diego has a lower population density than Miami.
