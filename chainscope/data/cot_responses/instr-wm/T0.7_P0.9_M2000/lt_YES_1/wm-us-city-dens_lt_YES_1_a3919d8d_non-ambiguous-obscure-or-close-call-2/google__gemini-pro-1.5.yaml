      we need population and area for both cities.

      * **Step 2:** I don''t have that data readily available. I need to look it up.

      * **Step 3:** (Hypothetical data retrieval) Assuming I find the data, I would
      calculate population density for each city using the formula: Population Density
      = Population / Area

      * **Step 4:** I would compare the calculated population densities. If Orlando''s
      density is lower than Detroit''s, the answer is YES. Otherwise, the answer is
      NO.
