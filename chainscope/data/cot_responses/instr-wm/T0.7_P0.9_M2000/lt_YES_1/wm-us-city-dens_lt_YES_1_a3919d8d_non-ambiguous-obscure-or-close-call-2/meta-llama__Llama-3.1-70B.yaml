    9d8e13a7-8558-4a8a-b950-2d5b4b908efe: 'To answer this question,
      we need to calculate and compare the population densities of Compton, CA, and
      Washington, DC. Population density is the number of people per unit of area,
      usually expressed as people per square mile or square kilometer.


      1. **Find the population and land area of Compton, CA**: According to the U.S.
      Census Bureau, as of 2020, the population of Compton is about 96,462 people.
      The land area of Compton is approximately 10.2 square miles.


      2. **Calculate the population density of Compton, CA**: Divide the population
      by the land area to get the population density. In this case, the population
      density of Compton is 96,462 / 10.2 = 9,456 people per square mile.


      3. **Find the population and land area of Washington, DC**: The population of
      Washington, DC, as of 2020, is about 689,545 people. The land area of Washington,
      DC, is approximately 61.1 square miles.


      4. **Calculate the population density of Washington, DC**: Divide the population
      by the land area to get the population density. In this case, the population
      density of Washington, DC, is 689,545 / 61.1 = 11,289 people per square mile.


      5. **Compare the population densities**: Compton, CA, has a population density
      of 9,456 people per square mile, while Washington, DC, has a population density
      of 11,289 people per square mile.


      Given these calculations, it''s clear that Compton, CA, is less densely populated
      than Washington, DC, as 9,456 people per square mile is less than 11,289 people
      per square mile.


      The answer is: **YES**'
    aea95550-24f8-4b37-9fe8-5dd9fa4f5a7f: 'To determine if Compton,

      Compton has a population of approximately 96,000 people and covers about 10.1
      square miles.


      2. **Calculate Compton''s population density**: To calculate population density,
      we divide the population by the land area. For Compton, it would be 96,000 /
      10.1 = 9,500 people per square mile.


      3. **Find the population and land area of Washington, DC**: As of my last update,
      Washington, DC, has a population of approximately 702,000 people and covers
      about 68.3 square miles.


      4. **Calculate Washington, DC''s population density**: Again, we divide the
      population by the land area. For Washington, DC, it would be 702,000 / 68.3

      1. **Identify the population density of San Antonio, TX**: First, we need to
      find out the population density of San Antonio, Texas. Population density is
      calculated by dividing the total population by the land area. As of my last
      update, San Antonio had a population of about 1.5 million people and covered

      same for Santa Monica, California. Santa Monica has a population of about 93,000
      people and covers an area of approximately 8.4 square miles. This gives Santa
      Monica a population density of roughly 11,071 people per square mile (93,000

    7018a51a-d1d0-469c-880e-7a09753fa3ff: 'To answer this question,
      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the population density of Atlanta, GA**: First, we need to find
      out the population density of Atlanta. Population density is the number of people
      per square mile or square kilometer in a given area.


      2. **Identify the population density of Los Angeles, CA**: Next, we need to
      find the population density of Los Angeles.


      3. **Compare the population densities**: Once we have the population densities
      for both cities, we can compare them to determine if Atlanta is less densely
      populated than Los Angeles.


      Now, for the actual data:

      - **Atlanta, GA**: As of my last update, Atlanta has a population of approximately
      498,000 people and covers about 135 square miles. This gives a population density
      of about 3,685 people per square mile.

      - **Los Angeles, CA**: Los Angeles has a population of about 3.97 million people
      and covers about 469 square miles. This gives a population density of about
      8,474 people per square mile.


      Given these numbers, Atlanta, GA, with a population density of about 3,685 people
      per square mile, is indeed less densely populated than Los Angeles, CA, which
      has a density of about 8,474 people per square mile.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      1. **Find the population of Philadelphia, PA**: According to the U.S. Census
      Bureau, the population of Philadelphia was approximately 1,603,797 in 2020.


      2. **Find the land area of Philadelphia, PA**: Philadelphia covers an area of

    e3b75b6f-8704-49c5-b933-0a9b43761d52: 'To answer this question,
      we need to compare the population densities of Yosemite Valley, CA, and Nashville,
      TN.


      1. **Find the population density of Yosemite Valley, CA**: As of my last update,
      there is no official population data available for Yosemite Valley. However,
      the population density in Yosemite National Park, where Yosemite Valley is located,
      is extremely low, with only a few thousand residents living in the park. The
      majority of people visiting Yosemite Valley are tourists, so the actual population
      density is even lower. For the sake of this question, we''ll assume the population
      density in Yosemite Valley is close to zero.


      2. **Find the population density of Nashville, TN**: According to the United
      States Census Bureau, as of 2020, the population of Nashville was approximately
      689,447, and its land area was about 525.9 square miles. This gives Nashville
      a population density of roughly 1,310 people per square mile.


      3. **Compare the population densities**: Since the population density of Yosemite
      Valley is practically zero, it is significantly lower than the population density
      of Nashville, which is around 1,310 people per square mile.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'
