      - Maricopa County (Phoenix metro area) has approximately 4.5 million people

      - Cook County (Chicago metro area) has approximately 5.2 million people


      2. To determine if Maricopa is less populous than Cook:

      - 4.5 million < 5.2 million


      3. Since 4.5 million is less than 5.2 million, Maricopa County has fewer people
      than Cook County.
