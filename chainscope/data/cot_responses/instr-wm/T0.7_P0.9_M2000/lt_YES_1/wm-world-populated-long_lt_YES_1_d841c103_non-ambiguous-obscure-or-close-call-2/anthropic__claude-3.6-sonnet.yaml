      \ roughly 95\xB0W (west longitude)\n- The Canary Islands are at roughly 15\xB0\
      W (west longitude)\n\n3) Comparing the longitudes:\n- 95\xB0W is further west\

    ebebf1d4-3267-4797-82a8-443453ef8883: "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1) First,\
      \ let me recall the locations:\n- Casablanca is in Morocco, on the Atlantic\
      \ coast\n- Central Athens is in Greece, specifically in the Attica region\n\n\
      2) Let me check their approximate longitudes:\n- Casablanca: approximately 7.6\xB0\
      \ West\n- Central Athens: approximately 23.7\xB0 East\n\n3) Comparing these\
      \ longitudes:\n- Since Casablanca is at 7.6\xB0W and Athens is at 23.7\xB0E,\
      \ there is about 31.3 degrees difference\n- Casablanca is clearly west of Athens,\
      \ as it's on the negative (western) side of the prime meridian while Athens\
      \ is on the positive (eastern) side\n\nTherefore: YES"
