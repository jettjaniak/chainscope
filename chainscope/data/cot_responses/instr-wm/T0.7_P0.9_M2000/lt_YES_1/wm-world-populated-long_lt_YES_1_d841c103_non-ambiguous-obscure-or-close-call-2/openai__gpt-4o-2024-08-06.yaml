      2. **Budapest**: This is the capital city of Hungary, located in Central Europe.


      Now, let''s consider their relative positions:


      - Madrid is located in the western part of Europe.

      1. **Coney Island** is a well-known neighborhood and entertainment area in Brooklyn,
      New York City, USA. It is situated on the eastern coast of the United States.


      2. The **River Nile** flows through northeastern Africa, primarily through Egypt
      and Sudan, and it generally runs in a north-south direction.


      3. The River Nile is east of the Prime Meridian, which runs through Greenwich,
      England. Coney Island, being in New York, is also east of the Prime Meridian
      but is located further west when considering the global longitudes.


      4. By comparing the relative positions, Coney Island is indeed west of the River
      Nile.
