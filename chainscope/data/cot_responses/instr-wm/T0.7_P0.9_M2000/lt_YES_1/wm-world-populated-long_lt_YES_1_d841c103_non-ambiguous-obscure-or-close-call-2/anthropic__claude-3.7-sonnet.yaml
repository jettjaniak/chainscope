      - Los Angeles is located on the west coast of the United States, in California.

      - Detroit is located in Michigan, in the Midwest/Great Lakes region.

      - Budapest is the capital city of Hungary, located in central Europe.


      Step 2: Let me consider their positions on a map of Europe.
