      S latitude and 109\xB0W longitude.\n\n2. **Location of Holland (Netherlands)**:\
      \  \n   Holland is a region in the western part of the Netherlands, a country\
      \ in northwestern Europe. The approximate coordinates of the Netherlands are\
      \ around 52\xB0N latitude and 5\xB0E longitude.\n\n3. **Understanding \"west\
      \ of\"**:  \n   Being \"west of\" a location means that the longitude is numerically\
      \ greater in the westward direction. Longitudes increase westward from the Prime\
      \ Meridian (0\xB0), going up to 180\xB0W.\n\n4. **Comparison of Longitudes**:\
      \  \n   - Easter Island is at 109\xB0W.  \n   - The Netherlands is at 5\xB0\

      \ Britain is the island that includes England, Scotland, and Wales. It lies\
      \ to the northwest of mainland Europe.\n\n4. **Determine the longitude of Great\
      \ Britain**:  \n   Great Britain spans approximately from 1.7\xB0 West to about\
      \ 6\xB0 West longitude.\n\n5. **Compare the longitudes**:  \n   Capri is at\
