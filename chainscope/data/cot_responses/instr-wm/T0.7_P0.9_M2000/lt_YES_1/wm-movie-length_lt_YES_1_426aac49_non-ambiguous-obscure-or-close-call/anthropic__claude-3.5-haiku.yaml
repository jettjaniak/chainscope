      1. First, let''s look at the length of Peter Jackson''s The Hobbit trilogy:

      - The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012) - 169 minutes

      - The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013) - 161 minutes

      - The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (2014) - 144 minutes

      - Total runtime of the trilogy: 474 minutes (about 7 hours and 54 minutes)


      2. Now, let''s look at Francis Ford Coppola''s The Godfather (1972):

      - Original theatrical runtime: 175 minutes (about 2 hours and 55 minutes)


      3. Comparing the two:

      - The Hobbit trilogy: 474 minutes

      - The Godfather: 175 minutes


      4. Clearly, The Hobbit trilogy is much longer than The Godfather.


      Therefore, the answer is:
