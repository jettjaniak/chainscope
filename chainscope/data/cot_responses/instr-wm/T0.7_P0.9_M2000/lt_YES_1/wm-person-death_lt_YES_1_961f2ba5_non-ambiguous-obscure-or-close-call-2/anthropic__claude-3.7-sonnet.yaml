      John Locke was an English philosopher who lived in the 17th-18th centuries.
      He died on October 28, 1704.


      Step 2: Let me identify when Alfred Hitchcock died.

      Alfred Hitchcock was a film director who lived in the 20th century. He died

      lived and died.


      Step 1: Identify when Dante Alighieri lived and died.

      Dante Alighieri was an Italian poet of the Late Middle Ages. He was born around
      1265 and died in 1321.


      Step 2: Identify when Charles Darwin lived and died.

      Charles Darwin was an English naturalist and biologist who lived during the
      19th century. He was born in 1809 and died in 1882.


      Step 3: Compare the death dates.

      Dante died in 1321.

      Darwin died in 1882.


      Step 4: Determine which death occurred earlier.

      1321 comes before 1882 chronologically, with a difference of about 561 years.


      YES, Dante Alighieri died at an earlier date than Charles Darwin.'

      Step 1: Alfred Nobel''s death date

      Alfred Nobel was a Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, and the founder of the
      Nobel Prize. He died on December 10, 1896.


      Step 2: Ronald Reagan''s death date

      Ronald Reagan was an American actor and politician who served as the 40th President
      of the United States. He died on June 5, 2004.


      Step 3: Compare the dates

      December 10, 1896 comes before June 5, 2004. There''s more than a century between
      these dates.


      Therefore, Alfred Nobel died at an earlier date than Ronald Reagan.


      NO


      Wait, I need to be careful about the question. The question asks if Nobel died
      at an earlier date than Reagan, which means before Reagan. Since 1896 is indeed
      earlier than 2004, the correct answer is:

      Step 2: Ronald Reagan lived from 1911 to 2004. He died on June 5, 2004.

      Step 4: Since Alfred Nobel died in 1896 and Ronald Reagan died in 2004, Nobel

      NO. Alfred Nobel did not die at a later date than Ronald Reagan. Alfred Nobel
      died earlier (in 1896), while Ronald Reagan died later (in 2004).

      Step 2: Determine when Heath Ledger died.

      Heath Ledger, the Australian actor known for roles in films like "The Dark Knight,"
      died on January 22, 2008.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Mao Zedong died in 1976, while Heath Ledger died in 2008.

      1976 is earlier than 2008.


      Therefore, Mao Zedong died at an earlier date than Heath Ledger.


      NO


      Wait, I need to correct my answer. The question asks if Mao died at an earlier
      date than Heath Ledger. Since Mao died in 1976 and Ledger died in 2008, Mao
      did die at an earlier date.


      YES'

      Richard I of England, also known as Richard the Lionheart, died on April 6,

      Step 2: Identify when Nicholas II of Russia died.

      Nicholas II was the last Emperor of Russia. He was executed along with his family
      by the Bolsheviks on July 17, 1918.


      Step 3: Compare the dates.

      Abu Bakr died in 634 CE, while Nicholas II died in 1918 CE.


      Step 4: Determine which date came first.

      634 CE is approximately 1,284 years before 1918 CE.


      Therefore, Abu Bakr died at a much earlier date than Nicholas II of Russia.
