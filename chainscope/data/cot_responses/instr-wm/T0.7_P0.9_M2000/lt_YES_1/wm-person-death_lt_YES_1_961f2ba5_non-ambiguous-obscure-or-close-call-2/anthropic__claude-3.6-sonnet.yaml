      - 1941 comes before 1971

      - Therefore, Virginia Woolf died 30 years before Coco Chanel


      Answer: YES (Virginia Woolf did die at an earlier date than Coco Chanel)'

      1. First, let me recall when Virginia Woolf died

      - Virginia Woolf died on March 28, 1941

      - She committed suicide by drowning herself in the River Ouse


      2. Now, let me recall when Coco Chanel died

      - Coco Chanel died on January 10, 1971

      - She died in her apartment at the Ritz Hotel in Paris


      3. Now I can compare the dates:

      - Virginia Woolf: 1941

      - Coco Chanel: 1971

      - 1941 comes before 1971


      Therefore, since Virginia Woolf died in 1941 and Coco Chanel died in 1971 (30
      years later)...


      YES, Virginia Woolf died at an earlier date than Coco Chanel.'

      4. The question asks if Nobel died at an earlier date than Reagan

      - Since 1896 is earlier than 2004, Nobel did die at an earlier date


      Answer: YES'
    f73edc4c-2fba-47cc-a733-81b7405a715d: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, let me recall when Alfred Nobel died

      - Alfred Nobel died on December 10, 1896


      2. Next, let me recall when Ronald Reagan died

      - Ronald Reagan died on June 5, 2004


      3. Now I can compare these dates

      - 1896 comes before 2004

      - Therefore Nobel died approximately 108 years before Reagan


      4. Since Nobel died in 1896 and Reagan died in 2004, Nobel died at an earlier
      date


      Answer: YES'
