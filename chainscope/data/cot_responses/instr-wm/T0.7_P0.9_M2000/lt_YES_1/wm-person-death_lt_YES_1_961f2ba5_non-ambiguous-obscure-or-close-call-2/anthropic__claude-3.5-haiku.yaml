      1. First, when did historical Jesus live and die?

      - Jesus lived in the early 1st century CE

      - Most historians place his death around 30-33 CE


      2. Next, when did Jane Austen live?

      - Jane Austen lived from 1775 to 1817

      - She died in 1817


      3. Comparing their time periods:

      - Jesus died around 30-33 CE

      - Austen died in 1817

      - This means Jesus died approximately 1,784 years before Austen


      4. Conclusion:

      Since Jesus died much earlier than Jane Austen, the answer is clearly:

      - He died on June 2, 1988


      3. Comparing their death dates:

      - Dostoyevsky died in 1881

      - Kapoor died in 1988

      - 1881 is earlier than 1988


      4. The question asks: Did Dostoyevsky die at an earlier date than Kapoor?

      - Yes, he did


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
