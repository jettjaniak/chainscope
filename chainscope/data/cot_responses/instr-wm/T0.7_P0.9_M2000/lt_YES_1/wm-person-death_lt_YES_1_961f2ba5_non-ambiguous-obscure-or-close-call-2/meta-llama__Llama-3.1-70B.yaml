      Copernicus died on May 24, 1543.


      2. **Otto von Bismarck**: He was a Prussian statesman and the first Chancellor
      of the German Empire. Otto von Bismarck died on July 30, 1898.

      8, 1725.


      2. Lee Harvey Oswald was an American assassin who was killed on November 24,
      1963.


      Comparing the death dates, we can see that Piotr I died on February 8, 1725,
      which is earlier than November 24, 1963, when Lee Harvey Oswald died.

      died on February 8, 1725.


      2. **Lee Harvey Oswald''s Death Date**: Lee Harvey Oswald was an American former
      Marine who assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963.
      Oswald was then killed by Jack Ruby on November 24, 1963. Therefore, Lee Harvey
