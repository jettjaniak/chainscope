      - He was born in 1451.

      - He died in 1506.


      Step 2: Lewis Carroll

      - He was born in 1832.

      - He died in 1898.


      Step 3: Compare the death years

      - Columbus died in 1506.

      - Carroll died in 1898.


      Since 1506 is earlier than 1898, Christopher Columbus died at an earlier date
      than Lewis Carroll.
