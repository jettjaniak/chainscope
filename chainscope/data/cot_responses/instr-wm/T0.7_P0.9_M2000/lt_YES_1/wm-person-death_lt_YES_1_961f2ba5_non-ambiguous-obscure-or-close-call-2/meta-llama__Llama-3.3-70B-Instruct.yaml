      - Friedrich Nitzsch was a German theologian.

      - Grigori Rasputin was a Russian mystic and faith healer who influenced the
      later Russian royalty, the Romanovs.

      years being around 30 AD or 33 AD, depending on various interpretations of biblical
      accounts and historical records.


      2. **Establish the death date of Jane Austen**: Jane Austen, the English novelist,

      3. **Compare the death dates**: Given that Jesus died sometime between 26 AD

      let''s consider the known facts about the lives of Robert Kennedy and Stanley
      Kubrick.


      1. **Robert Kennedy**: He was an American politician who served as a U.S. Senator
      and was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968. Robert
      Kennedy was assassinated on June 6, 1968, in Los Angeles, California, after
      winning the California primary.


      2. **Stanley Kubrick**: He was a renowned American film director, producer,
      and screenwriter. Kubrick is known for his influential and innovative films.
      Stanley Kubrick died on March 7, 1999, at his home in Childwickbury Manor, Hertfordshire,
      England.


      Now, comparing the dates:

      - Robert Kennedy died on June 6, 1968.

      - Stanley Kubrick died on March 7, 1999.


      Given these dates, it''s clear that Robert Kennedy died more than 30 years before
      Stanley Kubrick.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Robert Kennedy died at an earlier date than
      Stanley Kubrick is: **YES**.'

      Darwin).


      Since 1321 is earlier than 1882, we can conclude that Dante Alighieri died at

      - Genghis Khan died in 1227.

      - Joan of Arc died in 1431.

      we need to determine the dates of death for both Genghis Khan and Joan of Arc.


      1. **Genghis Khan''s Date of Death**: Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol
      Empire, died in 1227. The exact date is not certain, but it is believed to be
      in August of that year.


      2. **Joan of Arc''s Date of Death**: Joan of Arc, the French heroine who led
      the French army to several victories during the Hundred Years'' War, was captured
      by the English and put on trial for heresy and witchcraft. She was executed
      by burning at the stake on May 30, 1431.


      Given these dates, we can see that Genghis Khan died in 1227, while Joan of
      Arc died in 1431. This means there is a significant gap of more than 200 years
      between their deaths.


      Therefore, considering the information, the answer to whether Genghis Khan died
      at an earlier date than Joan of Arc is: **YES**.'
