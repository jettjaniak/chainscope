      - This is actually a series of seven novels, not a single book

      - The entire series is quite long, spanning thousands of pages

      - Even a single volume in the series is likely longer than "Disgrace"


      3. Comparing the two:

      - "Disgrace" is a single, relatively short novel

      - "The Dark Tower" is a multi-volume epic fantasy series

      - A single volume of "The Dark Tower" would almost certainly be longer than
      "Disgrace"

    e4cedec7-6f50-4449-8816-b532f7cc940e: 'Let me break this down step by step:


      1. First, I''ll identify the two books:

      - "A Rogue Economist Explores" by Steven Levitt (I believe this is actually
      "Freakonomics")

      - "Doctor Sleep" by Stephen King


      2. I''ll check the typical lengths of these books:

      - "Freakonomics" is typically around 320 pages

      - "Doctor Sleep" is typically around 530-540 pages


      3. Comparing the lengths:

      - "Doctor Sleep" is significantly longer than "Freakonomics"


      4. Therefore, "A Rogue Economist Explores" is shorter than "Doctor Sleep"

      1. First, I''ll recall the length of "When Breath Becomes Air" by Paul Kalanithi:

      - This is a memoir about his experience with terminal cancer

      - It is known to be a relatively short book

      - Most sources indicate it is around 200 pages long


      2. Next, I''ll recall the length of "All the President''s Men" by Carl Bernstein
