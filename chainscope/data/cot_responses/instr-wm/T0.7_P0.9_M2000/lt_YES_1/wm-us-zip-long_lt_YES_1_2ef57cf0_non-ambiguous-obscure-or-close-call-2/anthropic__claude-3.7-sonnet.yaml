      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 55425 is in Minnesota (MN)

      - 11976 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Minnesota and New York within the
      United States.

      - Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - The United States generally has states arranged with eastern states (like
      New York) being further east (closer to the Atlantic Ocean)

      - Midwestern states like Minnesota are positioned west of the eastern states


      Step 4: Specifically, Minnesota is significantly west of New York on a map of
      the United States. All of Minnesota is west of all of New York.


      Therefore, zip code 55425 in Minnesota is indeed located west of zip code 11976
      in New York.

      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - States in the Midwest (like Minnesota) are generally west of states on the
      East Coast (like New York)

      - Minnesota is significantly west of New York on a map of the United States


      Step 4: Confirm with geographic knowledge.

      - Minnesota''s eastern border is still far west of New York''s western border

      - All of Minnesota is west of all of New York


      Therefore, zip code 55425 in Minnesota is definitely located west of zip code
      11976 in New York.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 90028 is in California (CA), specifically in Hollywood, Los Angeles.

      - 11954 is in New York (NY), specifically in Montauk on Long Island.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, any
      location in California would be west of any location in New York.

      - Therefore, 90028 in CA is west of 11954 in NY.

      - 90265 is in California (CA), specifically Malibu

      - 10036 is in New York (NY), specifically Manhattan/New York City


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a map of the United States.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States

      - The entire state of California is west of the entire state of New York


      Step 4: Make the conclusion.

      - Since 90265 (Malibu, CA) is in California, and 10036 (Manhattan, NY) is in

      - 89109 is in Nevada (NV), specifically in Las Vegas

      - 33139 is in Florida (FL), specifically in Miami Beach


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Nevada and Florida within the United
      States.

      - Nevada is located in the western part of the United States

      - Florida is located in the southeastern part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic
      Ocean (east)

      - Nevada is much closer to the Pacific Ocean

      - Florida is on the Atlantic Ocean side of the country


      Step 4: Make the determination based on longitude (east-west position).

      - States in the west have lower longitude numbers than states in the east

      - Therefore, California is west of New York


      Step 4: Since the zip codes 94133 and 10007 are in California and New York respectively,
