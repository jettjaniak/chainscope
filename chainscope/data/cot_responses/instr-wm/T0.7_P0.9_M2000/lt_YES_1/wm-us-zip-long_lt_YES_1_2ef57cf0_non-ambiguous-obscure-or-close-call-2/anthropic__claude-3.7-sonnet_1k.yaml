      of 11976, NY, I need to:


      1. Identify where these zip codes are located

      2. Determine their relative positions on the east-west axis


      For US zip codes:

      - Lower numbers generally start in the northeast and move west and south

      - 1xxxx zip codes are typically in the Northeast (like New York)

      - 5xxxx zip codes are typically in the Midwest (like Minnesota)


      55425 is a zip code in Minnesota (MN), which is in the Midwest region of the
      United States.

      11976 is a zip code in New York (NY), which is in the Northeast region of the
      United States.


      The United States is oriented such that the east coast (including New York)
      is on the east, and as you move west, you reach the Midwest (including Minnesota)
      before reaching the west coast.


      So geographically, Minnesota is west of New York.</think>I''ll solve this step
      by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 55425 is in Minnesota (MN)

      - 11976 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Determine their geographic positions.

      - Minnesota is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - The United States generally extends from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the
      Pacific Ocean (west)

      - New York borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast

      - Minnesota is significantly inland, in the middle of the country

      - On a map of the US, Minnesota is clearly west of New York


      Therefore, YES, 55425, MN is located west of 11976, NY.'

      To be more specific about these zip codes:

      - 55425 is in Minnesota (MN)

      - 11976 is in New York (NY)

      - 55425 is a zip code in Minnesota (MN)

      - 11976 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      Minnesota is located in the Midwest region of the United States, while New York
      is located in the Northeast.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on the east-west axis.

      On a map of the United States, Minnesota is positioned significantly west of
      New York. All of Minnesota is west of all of New York.


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes.

      Since Minnesota is entirely west of New York, any zip code in Minnesota (including
      55425) must be west of any zip code in New York (including 11976).

      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states in the US.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - States on the west coast (like California) are west of states on the east

      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, any
      location in California would be west of any location in New York.


      The specific zip codes don''t matter for this question - what matters is that
      90265 is in California and 10036 is in New York.


      So yes, 90265, CA (which is in California) is located west of 10036, NY (which
      is in New York).</think>To determine if 90265, CA is west of 10036, NY, I need
      to identify the locations of these zip codes and compare their positions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 90265 is a zip code in California (CA)

      - 10036 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of California and New York.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic
      Ocean (east)

      - California is significantly west of New York on the map of the United States


      Since any location in California (including zip code 90265) is west of any location
      in New York (including zip code 10036), the answer is:


      YES'

      The question is asking if zip code 90265 in California is located west of zip
      code 10036 in New York.


      Step 1: Let me identify these locations.

      - 90265 is in California (CA). This appears to be Malibu, California.

      - 10036 is in New York (NY). This appears to be in Manhattan, New York City.


      Step 2: Determine their relative east-west positions.

      In the United States, California is on the west coast, while New York is on
      the east coast. So generally speaking, any location in California would be west
      of any location in New York.


      Step 3: Verify this general understanding with geographical knowledge.

      The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic
      Ocean (east). California borders the Pacific Ocean on the west, while New York
      borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east. The entire state of California is west
      of the entire state of New York.


      Therefore, zip code 90265 in CA (Malibu) is definitely located west of zip code
      10036 in NY (Manhattan).</think>I need to determine the geographical relationship
      between these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 90265 is a zip code in California (CA)

      - 10036 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of California and New York

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Determine their east-west relationship

      - All of California is geographically west of all of New York

      - Therefore, any zip code in California (including 90265) must be west of any
      zip code in New York (including 10036)


      YES, 90265, CA is located west of 10036, NY.'

      the geographic locations of two areas identified by zip codes: 94027 in California
      (CA) and 10019 in New York (NY).


      To answer whether 94027, CA is located west of 10019, NY, I need to understand
      the geography of the United States.


      The United States spans from the Pacific Ocean on the west to the Atlantic Ocean
      on the east. California is a state on the west coast of the US, bordering the
      Pacific Ocean. New York is a state on the east coast of the US, bordering the
      Atlantic Ocean.


      Because of this basic geography:

      - California is located west of New York

      - Any location in California would be west of any location in New York


      Therefore, zip code 94027 in California would be located west of zip code 10019
      in New York.</think>To determine if 94027, CA is located west of 10019, NY,
      I need to analyze the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 94027 is a zip code in California (CA)

      - 10019 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of California and New York within
      the United States.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - All of California lies west of New York

      - Therefore, any zip code in California will be west of any zip code in New
      York


      YES, 94027, CA is located west of 10019, NY.'

      code.


      The United States generally has states arranged with the East Coast (including
      New York) on the eastern side of the country, and states like Louisiana are
      more toward the center-south.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - New York is on the east coast

      - Louisiana is in the southeast/south-central region


      Since the US has its states arranged from west to east, with the east coast
      (including New York) being the easternmost part, and Louisiana being more central
      and to the south:

      - 70130 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA), likely in the New Orleans area.

      - 10013 is a zip code in New York (NY), likely in Manhattan.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Louisiana is located in the southern part of the United States, significantly
      west of the East Coast.


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - All of Louisiana is west of New York state.

      - Therefore, any zip code in Louisiana (including 70130) would be west of any

      Louisiana is in the southern part of the US, and is generally located in the
      central-southeast region. New York is in the northeastern part of the US.

      - 10013 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York City, New York


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of these states on a US map.

      - 90291 is a zip code in California (CA)

      - 11201 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      The question is asking whether 90291, CA is located west of 11201, NY.


      In the United States, California is on the west coast, while New York is on
      the east coast. The continental US spans from west to east, with the Pacific
      Ocean on the west and the Atlantic Ocean on the east.


      Therefore, any location in California would be west of any location in New York,
      as California as a whole is west of New York.


      So, 90291, CA (which is in California) is indeed located west of 11201, NY (which
      is in New York).</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 90291 is a zip code in California (CA)

      - 11201 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of California and New York in the
      United States.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Apply geographic knowledge of US regions.

      - The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic
      Ocean (east)

      - California is significantly west of New York on any US map


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, any
      location in California (including zip code 90291) must be west of any location
      in New York (including zip code 11201).


      YES'

      this question:


      1) 90291 is a ZIP code in California (CA)

      2) 11201 is a ZIP code in New York (NY)

      3) To determine if one is west of the other, I need to know their relative positions
      on the US map


      The United States is oriented such that:

      - The West Coast (California, Oregon, Washington) is on the western edge

      - The East Coast (including New York) is on the eastern edge

      - California is on the West Coast, while New York is on the East Coast


      Therefore, any location in California would be west of any location in New York.
      This is because California is located on the western side of the United States,
      while New York is on the eastern side.


      So 90291, CA (which appears to be in the Venice area of Los Angeles) is definitely
      west of 11201, NY (which appears to be in Brooklyn).</think>To determine if
      90291, CA is west of 11201, NY, I need to consider the geographic positions
      of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 90291 is a zip code in California (CA), specifically in the Venice area of
      Los Angeles.

      - 11201 is a zip code in New York (NY), specifically in Brooklyn.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States.

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, any
      location in California would be west of any location in New York.


      YES, 90291, CA is located west of 11201, NY.'

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - The West Coast is west of the East Coast

      - Therefore, California locations are west of New York locations


      YES, 94301 (Palo Alto, CA) is located west of 10023 (New York, NY).'

      - 10023 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      California is on the west coast of the United States, while New York is on the
      east coast. Going from east to west across the continental United States, you
      would generally travel from New York toward California.


      Step 3: Determine the relative positions.

      is west of New York.


      Step 4: Confirm the specific zip codes.

      While specific zip codes within states could theoretically change this relationship
      if they were extremely close to each other at a state border, in this case we''re
      comparing locations that are across the country from each other. 94301 appears
      to be in Palo Alto, CA (Silicon Valley area) and 10023 is in Manhattan, NY.

      - 10014 is in New York (NY)


      Looking at the geography of the United States:

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Louisiana is located in the southern part of the country, near the Gulf of
      Mexico


      In terms of east-west positioning:

      - New York is very far east in the continental US

      - Louisiana is much farther west than New York


      When comparing the longitudes, Louisiana is definitely west of New York. The

      start with lower numbers and those on the west coast have higher numbers. However,
      it''s not a perfect west-to-east ordering, so I should verify the specific locations.


      First let''s identify these locations:

      - 70116 is in Louisiana (LA), which is in the southern United States along the
      Gulf of Mexico

      - 10014 is in New York (NY), which is on the northeastern coast of the United
      States


      The United States is laid out such that:

      - The East Coast (including New York) is along the Atlantic Ocean

      - The West Coast (California, Oregon, Washington) is along the Pacific Ocean

      - The southern states like Louisiana are between the East Coast and the middle

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 70116 is a zip code in New Orleans, Louisiana (LA)

      - 10014 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Louisiana is located in the southern United States along the Gulf of Mexico

      - New York is located on the northeastern coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare east-west positioning.

      - Louisiana is significantly west of New York on the map

      - New York is on the eastern seaboard, while Louisiana is in the south-central
      part of the country

      - When moving from east to west across the United States, you would encounter
      New York before Louisiana


      YES, 70116, LA is located west of 10014, NY.'

    88b25263-c954-4db6-8ebe-0f0c7d58fd35: '<think>Let me determine the correct answer
      by figuring out the locations of these zip codes.


      90210 is the zip code for Beverly Hills, California. It''s a famous zip code
      that I recognize.

      10011 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York.


      Now I need to determine which one is further west. The United States has the
      Pacific Ocean on the west coast and the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast. California
      is on the west coast, while New York is on the east coast.


      So California is west of New York. Therefore, 90210 (Beverly Hills, CA) is west
      of 10011 (Manhattan, NY).</think>To answer this question, I need to identify
      the locations of these zip codes and determine their east-west relationship.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 90210 is the zip code for Beverly Hills, California

      - 10011 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York


      Step 2: Consider the geographic orientation of the United States.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, California
      is west of New York

      - Therefore, Beverly Hills (90210, CA) is west of Manhattan (10011, NY)


      YES'
    99a17b75-908b-475f-a6d9-9534a99df2fc: '<think>I need to determine whether 90210,
      CA is located west of 10011, NY.


      First, let me identify these zip codes:

      - 90210 is the zip code for Beverly Hills, California

      - 10011 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York City, New York


      Now, I need to determine their relative positions on the map of the United States.


      The United States spans from west to east, with:

      - The Pacific Ocean on the west coast

      - The Atlantic Ocean on the east coast


      California is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific
      Ocean.

      New York is on the east coast of the United States, bordering the Atlantic Ocean.


      Therefore, California is west of New York.


      Since 90210 is in California and 10011 is in New York, 90210 is west of 10011.</think>To
      determine if 90210, CA is located west of 10011, NY, I need to understand the
      geographic locations of these zip codes.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - States on the west coast (like California) have more westerly longitudes than
      states on the east coast (like New York)

      - All of California is west of all of New York on a map of the United States


      Therefore, 90210 in Beverly Hills, California is definitely located west of
      10011 in Manhattan, New York.

      The two zip codes are:

      1. 90210, CA (California)

      2. 10011, NY (New York)


      First, I need to recall the general locations of these states in the US:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States


      Since the continental United States spans from west (Pacific Ocean) to east
      (Atlantic Ocean), and California is on the west coast while New York is on the
      east coast, any location in California would be west of any location in New
      York.

      - 90210 is in California (CA)

      - 10011 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the east-west axis.

      - The United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean
      (east)

      - California is situated along the Pacific coast

      - New York is situated along the Atlantic coast


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      - Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, any
      location in California (including 90210) must be west of any location in New
      York (including 10011)


      YES'
