      \ to determine if the zip code 55425, which is in Minnesota (MN), is located\
      \ west of zip code 11976, which is in New York (NY).\n\nIn the United States,\
      \ locations further west have higher longitudes (going westward from the Prime\
      \ Meridian, which passes through Greenwich, England). Actually, that's not right\
      \ - in the Western Hemisphere (which includes the entire United States), locations\
      \ further west have LOWER longitude values. This is because longitude is measured\
      \ from 0\xB0 at the Prime Meridian to 180\xB0 both east and west. The United\
      \ States is in the Western Hemisphere, so its longitudes are given as west longitude\
      \ (e.g., 74\xB0W).\n\nSo the correct way to think about this: in the US, locations\
      \ further west have higher NEGATIVE longitude values, or we can just say they\
      \ have a higher \"west longitude.\"\n\nI need to find the approximate locations\
      \ of these zip codes and compare their longitudes.\n\nZip code 55425 is in Minnesota\
      \ (MN), which is in the Midwest region of the United States. Minnesota is quite\
      \ far west compared to New York, which is on the East Coast.\n\nZip code 11976\
      \ is in New York (NY), which is on the East Coast of the United States.\n\n\
      Generally speaking, Minnesota is west of New York. But to be precise, let me\
      \ think about the approximate longitudes:\n\n- Minnesota typically has longitudes\
      \ around 93\xB0W to 97\xB0W.\n- New York typically has longitudes around 73\xB0\
      W to 80\xB0W.\n\nSince Minnesota's longitudes (93\xB0W to 97\xB0W) are more\
      \ westward than New York's longitudes (73\xB0W to 80\xB0W), Minnesota is west\
      \ of New York.\n\nTherefore, zip code 55425, MN is west of zip code 11976, NY.\n\
      \nActually, let me be more precise and check the specific locations of these\
      \ zip codes rather than just the states in general.\n\nZip code 55425 appears\
      \ to be in Bloomington, Minnesota, which is near Minneapolis. The Minneapolis\
      \ area is approximately around 93\xB0W longitude.\n\nZip code 11976 appears\
      \ to be in Water Mill, New York, which is on Long Island. Long Island is on\
      \ the eastern part of New York, approximately around 72\xB0W to 74\xB0W longitude.\n\
      \nSo, zip code 55425 in Bloomington, Minnesota (around 93\xB0W) is indeed west\
      \ of zip code 11976 in Water Mill, New York (around 72-74\xB0W).\n\nThe answer\

      \ code in Bloomington, Minnesota (MN), which is in the Midwest region\n- 11976\
      \ is a zip code in Water Mill, New York (NY), which is on Long Island on the\
      \ East Coast\n\n## Step 2: Compare their geographic positions\n- Minnesota is\
      \ significantly west of New York in the United States\n- In terms of longitude:\n\
      \  - Minnesota locations typically lie around 93\xB0W to 97\xB0W longitude\n\
      \  - Eastern New York (Long Island area) is approximately 72\xB0W to 74\xB0\
      W longitude\n\n## Step 3: Make the comparison\nSince 55425 (Minnesota) has a\
      \ greater western longitude (around 93\xB0W) than 11976 (New York, around 73\xB0\
      W), the Minnesota location is indeed farther west.\n\nYES"

      - 55425, MN is likely in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, which is\

      \ 55425 is near Minneapolis (around -93 degrees longitude), while 11976 is near\
      \ Long Island (around -72 degrees longitude). So 55425 is indeed west of 11976.\n\

    f72f8df4-fc68-491d-a500-96ff3b1569d1: "<think>This question asks whether the location\
      \ with zip code 55425 in Minnesota (MN) is located west of the location with\
      \ zip code 11976 in New York (NY).\n\nTo determine this, I need to know the\
      \ longitude of both locations. In the US, places further west have higher longitude\
      \ values.\n\nActually, I made a mistake. In the US, places further west have\
      \ LOWER longitude values, not higher. This is because longitude is measured\
      \ in degrees east or west of the Prime Meridian (0\xB0), with west being negative\
      \ and east being positive. Since both locations are in the US and thus in the\
      \ Western Hemisphere, they both have negative longitudes, and the more western\
      \ location would have the more negative (lower) value.\n\nSo I need to determine:\n\
      1. The longitude of zip code 55425 in MN\n2. The longitude of zip code 11976\
      \ in NY\n3. Compare them to see which one is further west\n\nLet me think about\
      \ the general geography of the United States. Minnesota (MN) is in the Midwest,\
      \ while New York (NY) is on the East Coast. Generally speaking, Minnesota is\
      \ west of New York. \n\nTo be more precise:\n- Minnesota is roughly between\
      \ 89\xB0W and 97\xB0W longitude.\n- New York is roughly between 72\xB0W and\
      \ 80\xB0W longitude.\n\nGiven these general ranges, it's very likely that a\
      \ zip code in Minnesota is west of a zip code in New York. However, to be absolutely\
      \ certain, I should consider the specific zip codes.\n\nZip code 55425 is in\
      \ Bloomington, Minnesota, which is in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan\
      \ area in the eastern part of the state.\nZip code 11976 appears to be in Water\
      \ Mill, New York, which is on Long Island, in the eastern part of New York state.\n\
      \nEven though both are in the eastern parts of their respective states, Minnesota\
      \ as a whole is significantly west of New York. The easternmost part of Minnesota\
      \ is still generally west of the westernmost part of New York.\n\nActually,\
      \ I need to be cautious. Let me double-check. Long Island extends quite far\
      \ east into the Atlantic Ocean, and it's in the extreme eastern part of New\
      \ York. However, even the easternmost point of Long Island would still be east\
      \ of any point in Minnesota.\n\nActually, I think I got confused in my explanation.\
      \ Let me clarify:\n- West longitudes are negative numbers\n- The more negative\
      \ the longitude, the further west a location is\n- Minnesota is west of New\
      \ York\n- Therefore, locations in Minnesota generally have more negative longitudes\
      \ than locations in New York\n\nSince Minnesota is west of New York, zip code\
      \ 55425 in MN is almost certainly west of zip code 11976 in NY.\n\nSo my answer\
      \ is YES, 55425, MN is located west of 11976, NY.\n\nActually, I think I'm still\
      \ making a mistake in my explanation. Let me try again:\n\n- Longitude measures\
      \ east-west position, with the Prime Meridian (0\xB0) serving as the reference\
      \ point\n- Locations west of the Prime Meridian have west longitude, often denoted\
      \ with negative numbers or with \"W\"\n- Both Minnesota and New York are west\
      \ of the Prime Meridian, so both have west longitudes\n- Minnesota is further\
      \ west than New York\n- Therefore, a location in Minnesota would have a greater\
      \ west longitude (e.g., 93\xB0W) compared to a location in New York (e.g., 74\xB0\
      W)\n- In terms of numerical values, Minnesota's longitude would be a larger\
      \ negative number (e.g., -93) compared to New York's (e.g., -74)\n\nSince Minnesota\
      \ is west of New York, zip code 55425 in MN is almost certainly west of zip\
      \ code 11976 in NY.\n\nSo my answer is YES, 55425, MN is located west of 11976,\
      \ NY.\n\nActually, I'm still having trouble keeping this straight, but I think\
      \ I was correct in my most recent explanation. Let's use the actual numerical\
      \ longitude values:\n\n- A point at 95\xB0W longitude would be represented as\
      \ -95 in decimal degrees\n- A point at 75\xB0W longitude would be represented\
      \ as -75 in decimal degrees\n- Since -95 < -75, the point at 95\xB0W is further\
      \ west than the point at 75\xB0W\n\nNow, applying this to our zip codes:\n-\
      \ Minnesota is generally between 89\xB0W and 97\xB0W longitude, so zip code\
      \ 55425 is likely around -93 to -94\n- New York is generally between 72\xB0\
      W and 80\xB0W longitude, and Long Island (where zip code 11976 is located) is\
      \ in the eastern part of the state, so it's likely around -72 to -73\n\nSince\
      \ Minnesota's longitude (around -93 to -94) is less than New York's longitude\
      \ (around -72 to -73), Minnesota is further west.\n\nTherefore, 55425, MN is\
      \ located west of 11976, NY.\n\nSo my answer is YES.\n\nActually, let me try\
      \ to keep it simpler:\n\n1. Minnesota is in the Midwest of the United States.\n\
      2. New York is on the East Coast of the United States.\n3. Therefore, Minnesota\
      \ is west of New York.\n4. Zip code 55425 is in Minnesota.\n5. Zip code 11976\
      \ is in New York.\n6. Therefore, zip code 55425 is west of zip code 11976.\n\
      \nThe answer is YES.</think># Reasoning Step by Step\n\nTo determine if 55425,\
      \ MN is located west of 11976, NY, I need to find the approximate locations\

    fd9799af-f149-4484-a87f-c514a0e39a2e: '<think>This question is asking me to determine
      whether a location with the zip code 55425 in Minnesota (MN) is located west
      of a location with the zip code 11976 in New York (NY).


      In the United States, locations that are further west have a higher longitude
      (measured in degrees west of the Prime Meridian). So I need to determine whether
      55425, MN is further west than 11976, NY.


      I don''t have the exact longitude coordinates memorized for these zip codes,
      but I can reason about the general locations:


      1. Minnesota (MN) is in the Midwest region of the United States, while New York
      (NY) is in the Northeast.

      2. Minnesota is considerably west of New York state in terms of geography.


      Let me think about this a bit more specifically. Minnesota borders North Dakota
      and South Dakota to its west, and Wisconsin to its east. New York is on the
      east coast of the United States.


      All of Minnesota is west of all of New York. The easternmost part of Minnesota
      is still west of the westernmost part of New York.


      So without even knowing the specific coordinates of these zip codes, I can confidently
      say that any location in Minnesota, including 55425, is west of any location
      in New York, including 11976.


      Actually, I made a mistake in my reasoning. Longitude in the western hemisphere
      is expressed as negative numbers, with more negative numbers indicating further
      west locations. So the correct statement is that locations further west have
      a LOWER (more negative) longitude, not a higher one. However, my conclusion
      remains the same: Minnesota is west of New York.


      So, 55425, MN is located west of 11976, NY.


      The answer is YES.</think>To determine if 55425, MN is west of 11976, NY, I
      need to consider the geographic positions of these locations.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 55425 is in Minnesota (MN)

      - 11976 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Minnesota is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - New York is located in the Northeast region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Minnesota lies entirely west of New York on a map of the United States

      - All Minnesota zip codes (including those in the easternmost parts of the state)
      are west of all New York zip codes


      Step 4: Specific zip code consideration.

      - 55425 is in the Minneapolis area of Minnesota

      - 11976 is in the eastern part of Long Island, New York

      - The specific locations maintain the west-east relationship of their respective
      states


      YES, 55425, MN is located west of 11976, NY.'

      1. Zip code 94043 is in California (CA).

      2. Zip code 10012 is in New York (NY).


      In the United States, California is located on the west coast, while New York

      - Zip code 10012 is in Manhattan, New York City, New York, on the east coast.


      So, going from east to west across the United States, you would encounter New
      York (including zip code 10012) before you reach California (including zip code
      94043). Or, stated differently, going from west to east, you would encounter
      California before New York.


      Therefore, 94043, CA is located west of 10012, NY.


      The answer is YES.</think>I need to determine the geographic relationship between
      these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 94043 is in Mountain View, California (CA)

      - 10012 is in Manhattan, New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of California and New York.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, California (including Mountain
      View) is clearly west of New York (including Manhattan)

      - Moving from east to west across the continental US, you would encounter New
      York before reaching California


      Therefore, 94043, CA is indeed located west of 10012, NY.

      94043 appears to be a zip code in Mountain View, California, which is in the
      San Francisco Bay Area on the west coast.

      10012 appears to be a zip code in Manhattan, New York City, on the east coast.


      Step 5: Make a conclusion.

      Since California is west of New York in the United States, and 94043 is in California
      while 10012 is in New York, it follows that 94043, CA is located west of 10012,
      NY.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.</think>I''ll think step by step to determine if
      94043, CA is located west of 10012, NY.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 94043 is a zip code in California (CA)

      zip codes and their geographical locations. I need to determine if 90028, CA
      is west of 11954, NY. Let me break down the approach:


      1. First, identify where each zip code is located (what cities or areas they
      correspond to).

      2. Then determine their relative positions on the US map.

      3. Finally, conclude whether one is west of the other.


      Let me start with 90028, CA:

      90028 is a zip code in California (CA). California is on the west coast of the
      United States. Specifically, 90028 is in the Los Angeles area, in Hollywood.


      Now for 11954, NY:

      11954 is a zip code in New York (NY). New York is on the east coast of the United
      States. I''m not immediately certain which specific area in NY this zip code
      corresponds to, but it''s likely on Long Island or in the greater New York City
      area.


      Geographically speaking, the United States spans from the Pacific Ocean on the
      west to the Atlantic Ocean on the east. California is on the Pacific coast (west),
      and New York is on the Atlantic coast (east).


      Therefore, any location in California would be west of any location in New York,
      as California is the westernmost state between the two, and New York is much
      further east.


      So, 90028, CA (in Los Angeles/Hollywood) is indeed west of 11954, NY (in New
      York).


      The answer is YES.</think># Step by Step Reasoning


      To determine if 90028, CA is west of 11954, NY, I need to identify where these
      zip codes are located and their relative positions.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 90028 is a zip code in California (CA), specifically in the Hollywood area
      of Los Angeles

      - 11954 is a zip code in New York (NY), on Long Island


      ## Step 2: Determine geographic orientation

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      ## Step 3: Compare relative positions

      - The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic
      Ocean (east)

      - California borders the Pacific Ocean

      - New York borders the Atlantic Ocean

      - All of California is therefore west of all of New York

      is located west of 11954, NY. To do this, I need to understand the locations
      of these two zip codes.


      US zip codes are generally organized in a pattern where:

      - Lower numbers tend to be in the eastern parts of the United States

      - Higher numbers tend to be in the western parts of the United States


      Specifically:

      - Zip codes starting with 0 and 1 are in the northeastern states

      - Zip codes starting with 9 are generally in the western states (California,
      Oregon, Washington, etc.)


      So, 90028 starts with 9, which suggests it''s in the western United States,
      specifically in California (CA).

      11954 starts with 1, which suggests it''s in the northeastern United States,
      specifically in New York (NY).


      Since the United States extends from east to west, and New York is on the east
      coast while California is on the west coast, we can determine that California
      is west of New York.


      Therefore, 90028, CA would be west of 11954, NY.


      Let me double-check this logic:


      1. 90028 is in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the US

      2. 11954 is in New York (NY), which is on the east coast of the US

      3. The continental US extends from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west)

      4. California is further west than New York


      Yes, 90028, CA is located west of 11954, NY.</think>To determine if 90028, CA

      - 90028 is in California (CA)

      - 11954 is in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Determine the relative positions of these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west). California borders the Pacific Ocean on the west coast, while
      New York is near the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast.


      Since California is positioned on the western side of the country and New York
      is on the eastern side, any location in California will be west of any location
      in New York.

      of 11954, NY, I need to determine their geographical locations and compare them.


      90028 is a ZIP code in California (CA). California is on the west coast of the
      United States.


      11954 is a ZIP code in New York (NY). New York is on the east coast of the United
      States.


      In the United States, locations on the west coast are generally considered to
      be west of locations on the east coast. This is because the mainland US spans
      from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean (west).


      So geographically speaking, any location in California, which is on the west
      coast, would be west of any location in New York, which is on the east coast.


      Therefore, 90028, CA is west of 11954, NY.


      Actually, let me double-check my reasoning by looking more specifically at the
      locations of these zip codes:


      90028 is a ZIP code in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles, California. Los Angeles
      is indeed on the west coast of the United States.


      11954 is a ZIP code in Suffolk County, New York, which is on Long Island. Long
      Island is on the east coast of the United States.


      So my original reasoning was correct. Since 90028 is in California on the west
      coast and 11954 is in New York on the east coast, 90028, CA is west of 11954,
      NY.


      To be even more precise about this, we could consider the longitude coordinates
      of these locations:

      - Locations further west have a lower (more negative) longitude value.

      - Locations further east have a higher (less negative or positive) longitude
      value.


      Since 90028, CA is on the west coast, it would have a lower longitude value
      than 11954, NY on the east coast. This confirms that 90028, CA is west of 11954,
      NY.


      So the answer is YES, 90028, CA is located west of 11954, NY.</think># Determining
      if 90028, CA is west of 11954, NY


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two ZIP codes on the US
      map.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 90028 is a ZIP code in California (CA), specifically in the Hollywood area
      of Los Angeles

      - 11954 is a ZIP code in New York (NY), located on Long Island


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic positions

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      ## Step 3: Compare the positions

      - In terms of longitude, all of California is west of all of New York

      - The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic
      Ocean (east)

      - California borders the Pacific Ocean, while New York borders the Atlantic
      Ocean


      ## Conclusion

      YES, 90028, CA is located west of 11954, NY.'

      First, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes:

      - 90028, CA is a zip code in California

      - 11954, NY is a zip code in New York


      The question is asking whether 90028, CA is west of 11954, NY.


      In the United States, California is on the west coast, while New York is on
      the east coast. The continental United States generally spans from the Pacific
      Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean (east).


      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, California
      is west of New York.


      Therefore, 90028, CA is west of 11954, NY.


      The answer is YES.</think>To determine if 90028, CA is west of 11954, NY, I

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 90028 is a zip code in California (CA)

      - 11954 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic
      Ocean (east). California sits along the Pacific Ocean, while New York borders
      the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since California is significantly west of New York on the U.S. map, any zip
      code in California (including 90028) would be west of any zip code in New York
      (including 11954).


      YES, 90028, CA is located west of 11954, NY.'

      2) I then need to determine whether the location in California (90265) is west
      of the location in New York (10036).


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 90265 is a zip code in California (CA). Without looking up the specific city,
      I know California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - 10036 is a zip code in New York (NY). New York is on the east coast of the
      United States.


      The United States is oriented such that the west coast (California) is geographically
      west of the east coast (New York). This is a standard geographical fact - California
      is toward the Pacific Ocean, while New York is toward the Atlantic Ocean.


      So, without even needing to identify the specific cities associated with these

      First, I need to identify where each zip code is located:

      - 94027, CA (California)

      - 10019, NY (New York)


      94027 is a zip code in California. California is on the west coast of the United
      States.

      10019 is a zip code in New York. New York is on the east coast of the United
      States.


      In the United States, the west coast is to the west of the east coast. So geographically,
      California is west of New York.

      - 94027 is a zip code in California (CA)

      - 10019 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States

      Let me first identify what these zip codes correspond to:

      - 94027, CA is a zip code in California

      - 10019, NY is a zip code in New York


      In the United States, California is on the west coast, while New York is on
      the east coast. The continental United States roughly spans from west to east,
      with the Pacific Ocean on the west and the Atlantic Ocean on the east.


      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, any
      location in California would be west of any location in New York.


      Therefore, 94027, CA (a zip code in California) is located west of 10019, NY
      (a zip code in New York).


      The answer is YES.</think>I need to determine if one zip code location is west

      Step 1: Let me identify what these zip codes correspond to.

      - 94027 is a zip code in California (CA)

      - 10019 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic layout of the United States.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      The United States spans from west to east with the Pacific Ocean on the west
      and the Atlantic Ocean on the east. California is significantly west of New
      York on any map of the United States.


      Step 4: Draw the conclusion about these specific zip codes.

      Since 94027 is in California and 10019 is in New York, and California is west
      of New York, it follows that 94027 must be west of 10019.

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 94027 is a zip code in California (CA)

      - 10019 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Now, I need to determine their relative positions. In the United States:

      - California is located on the west coast

      - New York is located on the east coast


      The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic

      \ is in the northeastern United States, toward the east. \n\nIn terms of geographic\
      \ orientation in the United States:\n- The East Coast, including New York, is\
      \ on the eastern side of the country.\n- Louisiana is in the south-central region,\
      \ but importantly, it's west of New York.\n\nSo in general, Louisiana is west\

    c25dbfbe-d399-4f41-b740-79c5421d70bb: "<think>Let's break this problem down:\n\
      \n1. I need to determine if zip code 70130 in Louisiana (LA) is located west\
      \ of zip code 10013 in New York (NY).\n2. To figure this out, I need to know\
      \ the geographical locations of these zip codes.\n\nFor 70130, LA:\nThis is\
      \ a zip code in Louisiana. Louisiana is in the southern part of the United States,\
      \ and is west of New York state. More specifically, 70130 is likely in New Orleans,\
      \ which is in southeastern Louisiana.\n\nFor 10013, NY:\nThis is a zip code\
      \ in New York. New York state is in the northeastern part of the United States.\
      \ More specifically, 10013 is likely in Manhattan, New York City, which is in\
      \ southeastern New York state.\n\nNow, to determine whether 70130, LA is west\
      \ of 10013, NY, I need to compare their longitudinal positions. In the United\
      \ States, locations further west have higher longitude values (more negative,\
      \ since the US is in the Western hemisphere).\n\nGiven the general geographical\
      \ knowledge:\n- Louisiana is considerably west of New York.\n- New Orleans (where\
      \ 70130 is likely located) is in the southeastern part of Louisiana.\n- New\
      \ York City (where 10013 is likely located) is in the southeastern part of New\
      \ York.\n\nEven though both cities are in the southeastern parts of their respective\
      \ states, the states themselves are far apart longitudinally. Louisiana is much\
      \ further west than New York, so zip code 70130 in Louisiana is definitely west\
      \ of zip code 10013 in New York.\n\nSo, the answer is YES, 70130, LA is located\
      \ west of 10013, NY.\n\nActually, I think I was wrong about one detail above.\
      \ In the western hemisphere, longitude values get more negative as you go further\
      \ west, not more positive. For example, the longitude of New York City is around\
      \ -74 degrees, while the longitude of Los Angeles is around -118 degrees. Los\
      \ Angeles is further west and has a more negative (or \"smaller\" in terms of\
      \ absolute value) longitude.\n\nLet me reconsider this. \n\nActually, let me\
      \ double check my statement about the longitudes in the western hemisphere.\
      \ Let's take two well-known locations:\n- New York City: approximately -74 degrees\
      \ longitude\n- Los Angeles: approximately -118 degrees longitude\n\nLos Angeles\
      \ is further west than New York City, and its longitude is -118, which is more\
      \ negative than -74. So in the western hemisphere, as you go further west, the\
      \ longitude gets more negative (or larger in absolute value).\n\nNow, let's\
      \ get back to the question. Louisiana is indeed west of New York. Even though\
      \ I don't have the exact longitude values for the zip codes, I can be pretty\
      \ confident that any location in Louisiana will be west of any location in New\
      \ York, based on the general geography of the United States.\n\nSo, the answer\
      \ is YES, 70130, LA is located west of 10013, NY.\n\nActually, I realized I'm\
      \ still making an error in my explanation. Let me correct myself:\n\nIn the\
      \ western hemisphere (where the US is located), longitude values are negative.\
      \ As you go further west, the absolute value of the longitude increases (the\
      \ number becomes more negative). For example:\n- New York City: approximately\
      \ -74 degrees longitude\n- Los Angeles: approximately -118 degrees longitude\n\
      \nLos Angeles is further west, and -118 is a larger absolute value (more negative)\
      \ than -74.\n\nBut regardless of the explanation, the conclusion remains correct:\
      \ Louisiana is west of New York, so zip code 70130 in Louisiana is west of zip\
      \ code 10013 in New York.\n\nSo, the answer is YES, 70130, LA is located west\
      \ of 10013, NY.\n\nActually, let me be more precise one more time. Longitude\
      \ in the western hemisphere is generally expressed as negative degrees. The\
      \ prime meridian (0 degrees longitude) passes through Greenwich, London. Locations\
      \ west of this line have negative longitude, and locations east have positive\
      \ longitude.\n\n- New York City: approximately 74 degrees west (or -74 degrees)\n\
      - Los Angeles: approximately 118 degrees west (or -118 degrees)\n\nSo, as you\
      \ move westward in the US, the longitude increases in the westward direction\
      \ (becomes more negative if using the -180 to 180 convention, or increases if\
      \ using the \"degrees west\" convention).\n\nNow, for the zip codes:\n- 70130,\
      \ LA: This is a zip code in New Orleans, Louisiana. New Orleans is at approximately\
      \ 90 degrees west.\n- 10013, NY: This is a zip code in Manhattan, New York.\
      \ Manhattan is at approximately 74 degrees west.\n\nSince 90 degrees west is\
      \ further west than 74 degrees west, zip code 70130, LA is indeed west of zip\
      \ code 10013, NY.\n\nActually, I apologize for the confusion again. Let me clarify\
      \ the longitude conventions:\n\nLongitude ranges from -180 degrees to +180 degrees.\
      \ The prime meridian (0 degrees) passes through Greenwich, London. Locations\
      \ west of the prime meridian have negative longitudes, and locations east have\
      \ positive longitudes.\n\n- New York City: approximately -74 degrees longitude\
      \ (74 degrees west)\n- Los Angeles: approximately -118 degrees longitude (118\
      \ degrees west)\n\nSo, as you move westward in the US, the longitude value decreases\
      \ (becomes more negative in the -180 to 180 convention). This means that a location\
      \ further west will have a smaller (more negative) longitude value.\n\nNow,\
      \ for the zip codes:\n- 70130, LA: This is in New Orleans, Louisiana, which\
      \ is at approximately -90 degrees longitude.\n- 10013, NY: This is in Manhattan,\
      \ New York, which is at approximately -74 degrees longitude.\n\nSince -90 is\
      \ less than -74 (or, in absolute terms, 90 degrees west is further west than\
      \ 74 degrees west), zip code 70130, LA is indeed west of zip code 10013, NY.\n\
      \nOK, but let's not confuse the negative sign of the longitude. Let's define\
      \ the longitude in terms of \"degrees west\" to avoid confusion. In this convention,\
      \ both New York and New Orleans (and all of the US) are \"west\" of the prime\
      \ meridian, meaning they both have \"degrees west\" values.\n\n- New York City:\
      \ approximately 74 degrees west\n- New Orleans: approximately 90 degrees west\n\
      \nSince 90 degrees west is further west than 74 degrees west, New Orleans is\
      \ indeed west of New York City.\n\nTherefore, zip code 70130 in New Orleans,\
      \ LA is west of zip code 10013 in New York, NY.\n\nSo, the answer is YES, 70130,\
      \ LA is located west of 10013, NY.</think># Is 70130, LA located west of 10013,\

      \ let me identify what these zip codes correspond to:\n\n94133, CA: This is\
      \ a zip code in California (CA). California is on the west coast of the United\
      \ States.\n10007, NY: This is a zip code in New York (NY). New York is on the\
      \ east coast of the United States.\n\nIn the United States, the west coast (including\
      \ California) is indeed west of the east coast (including New York). \n\nSo\
      \ geographically speaking, any location in California would be west of any location\
      \ in New York, because California as a whole is west of New York.\n\nTo be even\
      \ more precise, we can consider the longitude coordinates:\n- West longitudes\

      First, I need to identify the geographic locations:

      - 90291 is in California (CA)

      - 11201 is in New York (NY)


      The United States is organized such that the west coast (including California)
      is located to the west of the east coast (including New York). The continental
      United States spans from the Pacific Ocean on the west to the Atlantic Ocean

      So, zip code 90291 in California is located west of zip code 11201 in New York.


      To be even more specific:

      - 90291 is a zip code for Venice, California, which is in the Los Angeles area

      The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific Ocean
      on the west. California is on the west coast, bordering the Pacific Ocean, while
      New York is on the east coast, bordering the Atlantic Ocean.


      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, California
      is further west than New York.


      Therefore, 90291, CA (Venice, Los Angeles) is located west of 11201, NY (Brooklyn,

      90291, California is located west of 11201, New York. Let me think through this
      step by step.


      First, I need to determine the locations of these zip codes:

      - 90291 is in California (CA)

      - 11201 is in New York (NY)


      In the United States, California is on the west coast, while New York is on
      the east coast. The continental United States generally spans from the Pacific
      Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean (east).


      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, any
      location in California would be west of any location in New York.


      Therefore, 90291, CA is located west of 11201, NY.


      The answer is YES.</think>To determine if 90291, CA is located west of 11201,
      NY, I need to consider the geographic locations of these zip codes.

      - 90291 is a zip code in California (CA)

      - 11201 is a zip code in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of California and New York within
      the United States.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Apply basic US geography knowledge.

      - In terms of longitude, locations in California are west of locations in New
      York

      - The entire state of California is west of the entire state of New York


      Since 90291 is in California and 11201 is in New York, and California is west
      of New York, it follows that 90291, CA is located west of 11201, NY.

      on the east coast.


      Longitudes in the western hemisphere are expressed as negative numbers, with
      more negative numbers indicating more western locations. For example, California
      locations typically have longitudes around -120 degrees, while New York locations
      are around -74 degrees.


      So, without looking up the exact coordinates, I can confidently say that 94301,
      CA (Palo Alto, California) is located west of 10023, NY (New York City, New
      York).


      Therefore, the answer is YES.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west

      step.


      First, I need to identify where these zip codes are located:

      - 94301, CA is likely a zip code in California.

      - 10023, NY is likely a zip code in New York.


      Now I need to determine if the California location is west of the New York location.


      The United States is oriented such that the west coast (where California is
      located) is west of the east coast (where New York is located). California is
      on the Pacific coast on the western side of the country, while New York is on
      the Atlantic coast on the eastern side.


      So geographically, any location in California would be west of any location
      in New York.


      Therefore, zip code 94301, CA (which is in California) is located west of zip
      code 10023, NY (which is in New York).


      So the answer is YES.


      Let me double-check by being more specific about the locations:

      - 94301 is a zip code for Palo Alto, California, which is in the San Francisco
      Bay Area on the west coast.

      - 10023 is a zip code for the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City,

      Step 2: Determine their geographic positions within the United States.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic
      Ocean (east). California borders the Pacific Ocean, while New York is near the
      Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 4: Make a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, any
      location in California will be west of any location in New York.

      the locations of the two zip codes:

      - 70116 in LA (Louisiana)

      - 10014 in NY (New York)


      Let me think about the relative positions of these two states in the United
      States:


      Louisiana is in the southern part of the US, along the Gulf of Mexico. New York
      is in the northeastern part of the US, along the Atlantic Ocean.


      Now, regarding the east-west positioning, Louisiana is generally west of New
      York. The US mainland roughly spans from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the
      Pacific Ocean in the west, with New York being closer to the Atlantic (eastern)
      side and Louisiana being more centrally located but definitely west of New York.


      If we consider a map of the United States:

      - East Coast: Includes states like Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode
      Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, etc.

      - Gulf Coast: Includes states like Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,
      Texas


      Louisiana is definitely west of New York on the map of the United States.


      Therefore, zip code 70116 in LA (Louisiana) is located west of zip code 10014
      in NY (New York).


      The answer is YES.</think>I need to determine the geographical relationship

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 70116 is in LA (Louisiana)

      - 10014 is in NY (New York)


      Step 2: Consider the geographical positions of these states.

      - Louisiana is located in the southern United States, bordering the Gulf of
      Mexico

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean


      Step 3: Determine east-west positioning.

      - The United States generally spans from east (Atlantic Ocean) to west (Pacific
      Ocean)

      - New York is on the eastern side of the country

      - Louisiana is more centrally located but definitely west of New York


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Looking at a map of the United States, Louisiana is clearly west of New York.
      Therefore, zip code 70116 in Louisiana is west of zip code 10014 in New York.

      2. Determine their relative east-west positions

      3. Answer whether 70116, LA is west of 10014, NY


      Let me think about the general geography first:

      - Louisiana (LA) is a state in the southern United States, along the Gulf of
      Mexico

      - New York (NY) is a state in the northeastern United States

      - Generally speaking, Louisiana is west of New York on a map of the United States


      Let''s be more specific about these zip codes:


      70116 is in Louisiana. I believe this is in New Orleans, which is in southeastern
      Louisiana.


      10014 is in New York. I believe this is in Manhattan (New York City), which
      is in southeastern New York state.


      In the United States, the first digit of the zip code generally indicates the
      region, with lower numbers being in the east/northeast and higher numbers being
      in the west/south.


      Zip codes starting with "1" (like 10014) are typically in the northeastern part
      of the country, including New York.

      Zip codes starting with "7" (like 70116) are typically in the south-central
      part of the country, including Louisiana.


      Since Louisiana is located to the west of New York on a map of the United States,
      and zip code 70116 (LA) would be west of zip code 10014 (NY).


      So my answer is YES, 70116, LA is located west of 10014, NY.</think># Is 70116,

      - 70116 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA), specifically in New Orleans

      - 10014 is a zip code in New York (NY), specifically in Manhattan, New York
      City


      ## Step 2: Compare geographical positions

      - Louisiana is located in the southern United States along the Gulf of Mexico

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States

      - Looking at the United States map, Louisiana is positioned to the west of New
      York


      ## Step 3: Confirm with zip code patterns

      US zip codes generally follow a pattern where the first digit indicates region,
      with lower numbers in the east/northeast and higher numbers moving west/south:

      - Zip codes starting with "1" (like 10014) are in the northeastern region

      - Zip codes starting with "7" (like 70116) are in the south-central region,
      which is west of the northeastern region

      relative east-west positions of two zip codes in the United States:

      1. 90069, CA (California)

      2. 10003, NY (New York)


      The question asks whether 90069, CA is located west of 10003, NY.


      I need to think about the geographic positions of these states. The United States
      spans from the east coast (Atlantic Ocean) to the west coast (Pacific Ocean).
      Generally:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States


      This means that California is west of New York.


      Since 90069 is in California (CA) and 10003 is in New York (NY), it follows
      that 90069, CA is located west of 10003, NY.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, any
      location in California will be west of any location in New York.


      Step 4: Draw conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      - Since 90069 is in California and 10003 is in New York, 90069 must be west
      of 10003.

    4e66d365-a50f-4207-b121-41577164326c: '<think>This is a question asking me to
      determine whether the zip code 90210, CA is west of the zip code 10011, NY.


      First, let me identify what these zip codes represent:

      - 90210 is a famous zip code for Beverly Hills, California (CA)

      - 10011 is a zip code in New York (NY), specifically in Manhattan


      Now I need to determine their relative positions. In the United States:

      - California is on the west coast of the country

      - New York is on the east coast of the country


      The continental United States is laid out such that:

      - The west coast (Pacific Ocean) is considered the westernmost part

      - The east coast (Atlantic Ocean) is considered the easternmost part


      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, California
      is west of New York.


      Therefore, Beverly Hills, CA (90210) is west of Manhattan, NY (10011).


      The answer is YES.</think>I need to determine if 90210, CA is west of 10011,
      NY by finding the geographic locations of these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 90210 is the zip code for Beverly Hills, California

      - 10011 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York City, New York


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of California and New York.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - States on the west coast (like California) have more westerly longitudes than
      states on the east coast (like New York)

      - In the United States, "west of" means closer to the Pacific Ocean, while "east
      of" means closer to the Atlantic Ocean


      Therefore, Beverly Hills, CA (90210) is indeed west of Manhattan, NY (10011).

      Let me break this down:


      1. First, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes.


      90210 is a well-known zip code for Beverly Hills, California, which is located
      on the west coast of the United States.


      10011 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York, which is located on the east coast
      of the United States.


      2. Now, I need to determine the relative positions of these locations.


      The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast to the Pacific
      Ocean on the west coast. California is a state on the west coast, bordering
      the Pacific Ocean. New York is a state on the east coast, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean.


      When we say a location is "west" of another, we mean it is positioned toward
      the west relative to the other location. On a map of the United States, west
      is to the left and east is to the right.


      So, is California (specifically, Beverly Hills, 90210) west of New York (specifically,
      Manhattan, 10011)?


      California is indeed west of New York. If you look at a map of the United States,

      \ myself:\n5. In the United States, all locations are in the western hemisphere,\
