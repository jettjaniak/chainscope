    171ba163-0c11-43cc-8101-c9af7b665c21: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the ZIP code 55425 in Minnesota (MN) is located west of ZIP code 11976 in\
      \ New York (NY). Let me start by recalling how ZIP codes work in the United\
      \ States. From what I remember, ZIP codes are structured such that the first\
      \ digit represents a group of states. The eastern states start with lower numbers,\
      \ and as you move west, the numbers increase. For example, the Northeast starts\
      \ with 0 or 1, then moving into the Midwest and further west. \n\nSo, New York\
      \ is in the Northeast, right? Their ZIP codes probably start with 1. Let's check\
      \ that. The given NY ZIP code is 11976. The first three digits are 119, so the\
      \ first digit is 1, which aligns with the Northeast region. Now, Minnesota is\
      \ in the Midwest, I believe, so its ZIP codes should start with a higher number,\
      \ maybe 5 or 6. The ZIP code in question is 55425. The first digit is 5, which\
      \ fits the Midwest region. \n\nNow, the key here is to determine the longitudinal\
      \ position of these two ZIP codes. Since ZIP codes are assigned from east to\
      \ west, with lower numbers in the east and higher in the west, a ZIP code starting\
      \ with 5 should be west of one starting with 1. But wait, ZIP codes aren't strictly\
      \ assigned in perfect longitudinal order across the entire country. The first\
      \ digit represents a region, but the subsequent digits can vary. So maybe I\
      \ need to look at the exact coordinates of these two ZIP codes.\n\nLet me think.\
      \ To accurately compare their longitudes, I need the specific geographic coordinates\
      \ (latitude and longitude) for each ZIP code. How can I find that? Well, I might\
      \ recall some major cities or use general knowledge. For example, New York State\
      \ is on the East Coast, so its longitude would be around -73 to -75 degrees.\
      \ Minnesota is in the upper Midwest, so its longitude would be around -93 to\
      \ -94 degrees, maybe? Wait, longitude decreases as you go west, so more negative\
      \ numbers are further west. \n\nSo if 55425, MN is around -93 longitude and\
      \ 11976, NY is around -73, then Minnesota would indeed be west of New York.\
      \ But let me verify this. Let's take specific cities. ZIP code 11976 is in New\
      \ York. Let me imagine where that is. Wait, 11976 is a specific ZIP code. Let\
      \ me think\u2014maybe it's in Suffolk County, Long Island? Long Island's ZIP\
      \ codes generally start with 117, 118, 119, etc. So 11976 is probably somewhere\
      \ on Long Island, which is the eastern part of New York. The longitude there\
      \ would be around -72.5 to -73 degrees. \n\nNow, ZIP code 55425 in Minnesota:\
      \ Minneapolis area ZIP codes start with 554. So 55425 would be in Minneapolis\
      \ or a suburb. The longitude of Minneapolis is approximately -93.3 degrees.\
      \ Comparing -93.3 (MN) to -73 (NY), Minnesota is definitely further west. Therefore,\
      \ 55425, MN is west of 11976, NY. \n\nAlternatively, I can think about the general\
      \ positions. Minnesota is in the Upper Midwest, while New York is on the East\
      \ Coast. So geographically, Minnesota is to the west of New York. Unless there's\
      \ a specific location in New York that's further west than Minnesota, but I\
      \ don't think so. New York's westernmost point is around Lake Erie, near Buffalo,\
      \ which is around -79 degrees longitude. Minneapolis is at -93, which is way\
      \ further west. So even the westernmost part of New York is still east of Minnesota.\
      \ \n\nTherefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \nTo determine if ZIP code\
      \ 55425 (Minnesota) is west of 11976 (New York):  \n1. **ZIP code regions**:\
      \ The first digit \"1\" in 11976 places it in the Northeast (easternmost), while\
      \ \"5\" in 55425 places it in the Midwest (further west).  \n2. **Longitudinal\
      \ comparison**: Specific coordinates for 11976 (likely Suffolk County, NY) place\
      \ it near ~-73\xB0 longitude. Minneapolis, MN (55425) is at ~-93\xB0 longitude.\
      \ Since lower (more negative) longitudes are farther west, Minnesota is west\
      \ of New York.  \n\n**Answer**: YES."
    22c17a0a-8e28-4200-a1a2-c1a834f51021: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the zip code 55425 in Minnesota (MN) is located west of the zip code\
      \ 11976 in New York (NY). Hmm, I need to figure out the approximate longitudes\
      \ of both zip codes because longitude determines east-west position. The further\
      \ west the longitude (more negative if we're using the US coordinate system),\
      \ the more west the location is.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in the US, zip\
      \ codes can sometimes give a rough idea of location. For example, the first\
      \ digit of a zip code generally corresponds to a region. Minnesota is in the\
      \ 5xxxx range, and New York is in the 1xxxx range. But the first digit alone\
      \ might not be enough. I need the actual longitude coordinates.\n\nI might not\
      \ remember the exact longitudes for these specific zip codes, so I need to think\
      \ of a way to estimate. Let's start with 55425, MN. Minnesota is in the Upper\
      \ Midwest. Major cities include Minneapolis and Saint Paul. The Twin Cities\
      \ area zip codes are around 554xx. So 55425 is likely in Minneapolis or a nearby\
      \ suburb. The approximate longitude for Minneapolis is about 93.2650\xB0 W.\
      \ Let me confirm that\u2014yes, Minneapolis is around 93.2\xB0 West longitude.\n\
      \nNow, 11976 is in New York. Let's see, New York zip codes starting with 1...\
      \ New York City is 100xx to 104xx, 110xx, etc. But 11976 might be further out.\
      \ Let me think. 11976 is actually in the state of New York. Wait, maybe it's\
      \ in Suffolk County on Long Island. Let me check mentally. For example, the\
      \ Hamptons are in Suffolk County, and their zip codes are around 119xx. So 11976\
      \ would be somewhere on Long Island. The approximate longitude for Long Island\
      \ is around 72\xB0 or 73\xB0 West. For example, Montauk, NY is around 71.96\xB0\
      \ W, but that's the eastern tip. Let's say the western part of Suffolk County\
      \ might be around 73\xB0 W. For example, Riverhead, NY is around 72.66\xB0 W.\
      \ So 11976 is probably around 72.5\xB0 to 73\xB0 W.\n\nComparing the two: Minneapolis\
      \ at ~93.2\xB0 W and Long Island at ~72.5\xB0 W. Since longitude increases westward\
      \ in the US (i.e., becomes more negative when measured in degrees west), the\
      \ higher numerical value (without considering the negative sign) means further\
      \ west. So 93.2\xB0 W is much further west than 72.5\xB0 W. Therefore, 55425,\
      \ MN is indeed west of 11976, NY.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I didn't mix\
      \ up the directions. The prime meridian is 0\xB0, and as you go west from there,\
      \ the longitude becomes negative (in the standard coordinate system). So, for\
      \ example, New York City is around 74\xB0 W, which is -74.0 in decimal degrees.\
      \ Minneapolis is at -93.265. When comparing westness, the more negative the\
      \ longitude, the further west. So -93 is more west than -72. So yes, 55425 (MN)\
      \ is west of 11976 (NY).\n</think>To determine if 55425, MN is west of 11976,\
      \ NY:  \n1. **Zip Code 55425 (MN):** Located in Minneapolis, approximate longitude\
      \ is **93.2\xB0 W**.  \n2. **Zip Code 11976 (NY):** Likely in Suffolk County,\
      \ Long Island, with a longitude around **72.5\xB0 W**.  \n\nSince **93.2\xB0\
      \ W** is farther west than **72.5\xB0 W**, the answer is **YES**.  \n\nANSWER:\
      \ YES"
    3f2aa5c0-169a-4260-81c3-c8b1d4b7929c: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure out if\
      \ the zip code 55425 in Minnesota is west of the zip code 11976 in New York.\
      \ \n\nFirst, I know that zip codes in the US are generally assigned from east\
      \ to west, with lower numbers starting in the Northeast and increasing as you\
      \ move west and south. But I'm not entirely sure how that translates to specific\
      \ states like Minnesota and New York. Minnesota is in the Midwest, so I think\
      \ their zip codes start with 5, right? And New York is on the East Coast, so\
      \ maybe their zip codes start with a lower number, like 1 or 0. Wait, 11976\
      \ is in New York, and 55425 is in Minnesota.\n\nBut the question is about longitude,\
      \ right? To determine if one is west of the other, I need to compare their longitudes.\
      \ The easternmost part of the US is obviously places like New York, and the\
      \ Midwest is further west. So Minnesota should be west of New York. But maybe\
      \ there's a specific location within those states that differs. For example,\
      \ some parts of New York might be further west than parts of Minnesota? Wait,\
      \ that doesn't seem right. Most of Minnesota is west of New York State. Let\
      \ me think about the approximate longitudes.\n\nNew York State's longitude ranges\
      \ roughly from about 71\xB0W (eastern part, like Montauk) to around 79\xB0W\
      \ (western part, near Buffalo). Minnesota's longitude is roughly from 89\xB0\
      W (eastern part, like Duluth) to 97\xB0W (western part). So even the easternmost\
      \ point of Minnesota is around 89\xB0W, which is west of the westernmost part\
      \ of New York (around 79\xB0W). So any location in Minnesota would be west of\
      \ any location in New York. Therefore, 55425, MN should be west of 11976, NY.\n\
      \nWait, but maybe the zip codes are in different areas. Let me check what cities\
      \ these zip codes correspond to. Zip code 55425 is in Minnesota. A quick search\
      \ in my mind: 554 prefixes are for Minneapolis area. So Minneapolis is in the\
      \ eastern part of Minnesota, but still, as I thought earlier, Minnesota's eastern\
      \ border is around 90\xB0W. New York's western border is around 79\xB0W. So\
      \ Minneapolis at around 93\xB0W longitude would definitely be west of any place\
      \ in New York, which is around 73\xB0W to 79\xB0W. \n\nZip code 11976 is in\
      \ New York. Let me think, 11976 is Suffolk County, maybe? That's on Long Island.\
      \ So Suffolk County is on the eastern end of Long Island, which is even further\
      \ east. So the longitude there would be around 72\xB0W. So 55425 in MN at 93\xB0\
      W is west of 11976 at 72\xB0W. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>To\
      \ determine if 55425, MN is west of 11976, NY:  \n1. **Geographical Context**:\
      \ Minnesota (MN) is a Midwestern state, while New York (NY) is in the Northeast.\
      \  \n2. **Longitude Comparison**:  \n   - The easternmost point of Minnesota\
      \ is near **\u224889\xB0W** longitude.  \n   - The westernmost point of New\
      \ York is near **\u224879\xB0W** longitude.  \n   - Even the **eastern edge\
      \ of Minnesota** (\u224889\xB0W) is significantly **west** of the **western\
      \ edge of New York** (\u224879\xB0W).  \n3. **Specific Zip Codes**:  \n   -\
      \ **55425** corresponds to Minneapolis, MN (\u224893\xB0W), while **11976**\
      \ is in Suffolk County, NY (Long Island, \u224872\xB0W).  \n   - Minneapolis\
      \ (93\xB0W) is unquestionably west of Suffolk County (72\xB0W).  \n\n**Answer**:\
      \ YES."
    50dff40a-cd85-4819-9447-ab24b51b9c9a: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the ZIP code 55425 in Minnesota is west of 11976 in New York. Let me start\
      \ by recalling what I know about ZIP codes and their geographic locations. \n\
      \nFirst, ZIP codes in the US are numbered starting from the northeast and moving\
      \ westward. The first digit generally represents a group of states. For example,\
      \ ZIP codes starting with 0 are in the Northeast, like Maine, Vermont, etc.,\
      \ and as you go higher, they move westward. But I think the initial digits might\
      \ not be the only factor here. Wait, 55425 starts with 5, which I believe corresponds\
      \ to the Upper Midwest, including Minnesota, Iowa, and maybe parts of surrounding\
      \ states. On the other hand, 11976 in New York starts with 1, which would be\
      \ in the Northeast, probably New York, as the question states.\n\nBut ZIP codes\
      \ don't directly translate to longitude. Just because a ZIP code starts with\
      \ a higher number doesn't necessarily mean it's further west. For example, some\
      \ northern states might have higher ZIP codes but be further east. Wait, maybe\
      \ I should check the actual longitude coordinates of these specific ZIP codes.\n\
      \nTo be precise, I need to find the approximate longitude of 55425 in MN and\
      \ 11976 in NY. The one with the higher longitude (more to the west) would be\
      \ the answer. But how do I get those longitudes? I might not have exact numbers,\
      \ but maybe I can approximate based on cities or regions.\n\nFor 11976, New\
      \ York. Let me think, New York State is in the Eastern Time Zone, and most of\
      \ it is east of, say, 75 degrees west longitude. For example, New York City\
      \ is around 74 degrees west. But 11976 might be a specific place. Let me check\
      \ which town that is. Maybe I can recall that 11976 is the ZIP code for Yaphank,\
      \ NY. Yaphank is in Suffolk County on Long Island. Long Island's eastern end\
      \ is around 72 degrees west, but Yaphank is more central, so maybe around 72.5\
      \ or 73 degrees west longitude.\n\nNow, 55425 in Minnesota. That's the Minneapolis\
      \ area, I believe. Minneapolis is around 93 degrees west longitude. For example,\
      \ downtown Minneapolis is approximately 93.265 degrees west. So, if both of\
      \ these are correct, then Minneapolis at around 93W is definitely west of Yaphank,\
      \ NY at around 73W. Therefore, 55425, MN would be west of 11976, NY.\n\nWait,\
      \ but maybe I should confirm the exact longitudes. Let me think of another way.\
      \ If I recall that Minnesota is in the Central Time Zone, which is UTC-6, whereas\
      \ New York is Eastern Time, UTC-5. The time zones generally correspond to longitudinal\
      \ bands. However, time zones can be a bit flexible, but Minnesota is indeed\
      \ further west than New York. So even if a ZIP code in Minnesota is in the eastern\
      \ part of the state, it's still west of New York. For example, Minneapolis is\
      \ in eastern Minnesota, but compared to New York State, which is on the East\
      \ Coast, Minnesota as a whole is much further west.\n\nTherefore, even if 55425\
      \ is in Minneapolis, MN, which is in the eastern part of Minnesota, it's still\
      \ well west of any location in New York State. So the answer should be YES,\
      \ 55425, MN is west of 11976, NY.\n</think>To determine if 55425, MN is west\
      \ of 11976, NY:  \n1. **ZIP code 11976** corresponds to Yaphank, NY, on Long\
      \ Island. Its approximate longitude is **-72.9\xB0**.  \n2. **ZIP code 55425**\
      \ is in Minneapolis, MN, with a longitude of approximately **-93.3\xB0**.  \n\
      3. Since **-93.3\xB0** (MN) is farther west than **-72.9\xB0** (NY), Minneapolis\
      \ is west of Yaphank.  \n\nANSWER: YES"
    6b998999-9489-4e1b-a49d-783d3fc0a33f: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out whether\
      \ the ZIP code 55425 in Minnesota is west of 11976 in New York. Hmm, let's start\
      \ by recalling what I know about ZIP codes. ZIP codes in the United States are\
      \ structured such that the first digit represents a group of states. The eastern\
      \ states start with lower numbers, and as you move west, the numbers increase.\
      \ For example, the Northeast starts with 0, then moving to the Midwest with\
      \ 4 or 5, and so on. But wait, do the first three digits of the ZIP code correspond\
      \ to a specific geographic region? Let me think... Yes, the first three digits\
      \ of a ZIP code denote a sectional center facility (SCF), which is a central\
      \ mail processing facility. Each SCF serves a specific geographic area, so the\
      \ numbering does have a general east-to-west progression.\n\nNow, let's check\
      \ the first digits of both ZIP codes. The Minnesota ZIP is 55425, so the first\
      \ digit is 5. The New York ZIP is 11976, starting with 1. Since 5 is higher\
      \ than 1, that might suggest that Minnesota is west of New York. But ZIP codes\
      \ aren't strictly linear from east to west across the entire country. For example,\
      \ states in the northeast might have lower numbers, then moving south and then\
      \ west. But generally, the first digit increases as you go west. So 5 would\
      \ be more central or western compared to 1, which is in the Northeast. \n\n\
      But wait, New York is in the Northeast, so ZIP codes there start with 0, 1,\
      \ maybe 2? Let me confirm. New York state's ZIP codes generally start with 1,\
      \ like New York City is 100xx, and other parts might be 10xxx to 12xxx. Minnesota\
      \ is in the Midwest, so ZIP codes there start with 5. So the first digit 5 is\
      \ for Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, etc. So 5 is definitely\
      \ more western than 1, which is in the Northeast. But latitude might be a factor\
      \ here too. So even though Minnesota is more west overall, is the specific ZIP\
      \ code 55425 in MN actually located west of 11976 in NY?\n\nTo get more precise,\
      \ maybe I should look up the actual longitude coordinates of these ZIP codes.\
      \ But since I can't do that right now, I'll have to approximate. Let's consider\
      \ the general locations. Minnesota is west of the Great Lakes, while New York\
      \ is along the Atlantic coast. The ZIP code 11976 is in New York. Let me think:\
      \ 11976 is probably in Suffolk County on Long Island. For example, 11976 is\
      \ the ZIP code for Yaphank, NY, which is in central Suffolk County, Long Island.\
      \ So the longitude of Yaphank, NY is approximately around 72.9 degrees west.\
      \ Now, what about 55425? That's a Minneapolis, Minnesota ZIP code. Minneapolis\
      \ is at about 93.26 degrees west longitude. So 93.26\xB0W is definitely west\
      \ of 72.9\xB0W. Therefore, Minneapolis, MN (55425) is west of Yaphank, NY (11976).\
      \ \n\nWait, but I should make sure that 55425 is indeed Minneapolis. Let me\
      \ think. Minneapolis ZIP codes start with 554, so 55401 to 55488, I believe.\
      \ So 55425 would be a part of Minneapolis or a nearby suburb. The longitude\
      \ of Minneapolis is around 93.26\xB0W. Yaphank, NY is at approximately 72.9\xB0\
      W. Since lower longitude numbers are further east (because longitude decreases\
      \ as you go west in the eastern hemisphere, but in the western hemisphere, like\
      \ the US, longitude increases as you go west from the Prime Meridian). Wait,\
      \ no, longitude in the US is all west longitude, measured as degrees west from\
      \ the Prime Meridian. So higher numbers mean further west. So 93\xB0W is west\
      \ of 73\xB0W. So yes, 55425 (Minneapolis area) is west of 11976 (Yaphank, NY).\
      \ Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES. The ZIP code 55425 in Minnesota\
      \ (Minneapolis area, approximately 93.26\xB0W longitude) is west of 11976 in\
      \ New York (Yaphank, approximately 72.9\xB0W longitude). Since the longitude\
      \ of Minneapolis is greater (further west) than that of Yaphank, the answer\
      \ is **YES**."
    86828098-7bcc-447e-a543-891f4b77fbb7: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the zip code 55425 in Minnesota (MN) is located west of the zip code 11976\
      \ in New York (NY). Alright, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst,\
      \ I remember that US zip codes can sometimes indicate regions, but I'm not sure\
      \ how precise they are for determining exact longitude. Still, maybe the first\
      \ few digits can give a general idea of the region. Let me think: I know that\
      \ zip codes in the eastern US start with lower numbers, and they increase as\
      \ you go west. For instance, states in the Northeast like New York have zip\
      \ codes starting with 0 or 1, while states in the Midwest like Minnesota might\
      \ have higher numbers. Wait, Minnesota's zip codes\u2014do they start with 5?\
      \ Yeah, I think so. So 55425 would be in Minnesota, which is a more central\
      \ northern state. New York's zip codes, like 11976, start with 1, which is definitely\
      \ in the eastern part of the US. \n\nBut just knowing the starting numbers might\
      \ not be enough. I need to check the actual longitudes of these specific zip\
      \ codes. Maybe I can recall or look up their approximate locations. Let's see...\
      \ 11976, NY. I don't know the exact location, but New York State is in the East\
      \ Coast, and maybe 11976 is somewhere there. For Minnesota's 55425, I think\
      \ that's in the Minneapolis area. Minneapolis is in the eastern part of Minnesota,\
      \ but Minnesota as a whole is west of New York. But wait, the actual longitude\
      \ might vary depending on where exactly the zip codes are.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe I can think of the central meridians of the states. New York is around\
      \ 75 degrees west longitude, maybe a bit more in the western parts of the state.\
      \ Minnesota is around 93 to 95 degrees west longitude. So generally, Minnesota\
      \ is west of New York. But zip codes can vary. For example, if 55425 is in eastern\
      \ Minnesota, maybe close to Wisconsin, and 11976 is in western New York, near\
      \ the border with Pennsylvania, the longitude difference might be smaller. \n\
      \nWait, 11976\u2014maybe that's a specific place. Let's try to recall. 11976\
      \ is in New York. I think it might be in Suffolk County on Long Island. If that's\
      \ the case, Long Island is pretty far east, around 73 degrees west longitude.\
      \ Meanwhile, Minneapolis, Minnesota is around 93 degrees west. So yes, 93 is\
      \ west of 73. Therefore, even if 55425 is in the eastern part of Minnesota,\
      \ it's still going to be west of any point in New York, including Long Island.\
      \ \n\nBut wait, is there any part of New York that's further west than parts\
      \ of Minnesota? No, because New York's westernmost point is around 79.76 degrees\
      \ west (near Buffalo), while Minnesota's eastern border is around 89.5 degrees\
      \ west. So the eastern edge of Minnesota is still west of the western edge of\
      \ New York. Therefore, any zip code in Minnesota would be west of any zip code\

    8d57895f-6367-4531-96ad-6bea36fd4894: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out whether\
      \ the zip code 55425 in Minnesota is located west of the zip code 11976 in New\
      \ York. Let me start by recalling that zip codes in the US are generally assigned\
      \ from east to west, with lower numbers in the east and higher numbers as you\
      \ move west. But I think that's more for the first digits. For example, the\
      \ Northeast starts with 0, then the next set goes further south or west, but\
      \ maybe that's just the first digit. Wait, maybe the first three digits of the\
      \ zip code indicate a specific region. Let me check my memory on that.\n\nSo,\
      \ the US postal codes (zip codes) are 5 digits. The first digit represents a\
      \ group of states. The first three digits are the sectional center facility\
      \ (SCF), which is a central mail processing facility. The first digit starts\
      \ in the east with 0 for parts of the Northeast and goes up as you move west.\
      \ For example, states like Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, etc.,\
      \ have zip codes starting with 0. Then as you move south and west, the first\
      \ digit increases. So, New York is in the 1 group, right? Because New York's\
      \ zip codes start with 1, like New York City is 100xx, etc. Then moving west,\
      \ the digits increase. But Minnesota is in the Upper Midwest, so maybe its zip\
      \ codes start with 5? Because I remember that the middle of the country has\
      \ 5 or 6. For example, Texas might be 7 or 8, California is 9. So Minnesota\
      \ is probably 5. Let me confirm that with examples. Minneapolis, MN has zip\
      \ codes like 55401, so yes, starting with 55, which would be part of the 5 group.\
      \ So 55425 is in Minnesota, which is in the 5 group. The New York zip code 11976\
      \ starts with 11. But wait, first digit is 1, which is the same as New York's\
      \ general area. But how do the first three digits work? Because 11976 would\
      \ be in the SCF for 119, which is in New York. But I need to figure out the\
      \ longitudinal position of these two zip codes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should\
      \ just look up the approximate longitude of each zip code. Because even though\
      \ the first digits give a rough idea, the actual longitude can vary. For example,\
      \ some parts of a state might be more east or west than others. So maybe the\
      \ key is to find the longitude for 55425, MN and 11976, NY and compare them.\n\
      \nLet me think. 11976 is in New York. New York State is located in the Eastern\
      \ Time Zone, and its western border is around -79 degrees longitude, but the\
      \ eastern parts are around -73. However, the exact longitude would depend on\
      \ the specific location of the zip code. Similarly, Minnesota is in the Central\
      \ Time Zone, but its eastern border is around -92 degrees, and the western part\
      \ goes to about -97 degrees. Wait, but longitude for New York State's western\
      \ part is around -79 (like Buffalo), while New York City is around -74. So if\
      \ the zip code 11976 is in New York, where exactly is that? Let me try to recall\
      \ or think. 11976 is a zip code in New York. Let me try to remember or perhaps\
      \ think of areas. 11976 corresponds to a place called Ridge, New York. Wait,\
      \ I'm not sure, but maybe it's in Suffolk County, which is on Long Island. For\
      \ example, 119xx zip codes are in Suffolk. If that's the case, then Ridge, NY\
      \ is on the eastern end of Long Island, which is quite far east, around -72.5\
      \ longitude. On the other hand, 55425 is in Minnesota. Let's see, Minneapolis\
      \ is around -93.3 longitude. The zip code 55425 is in Hennepin County, which\
      \ includes Minneapolis. So Hennepin County is in the eastern part of Minnesota,\
      \ but Minneapolis is still around -93.3. So comparing the two, -93.3 vs -72.5.\
      \ Since longitude west is measured as negative, the more negative the longitude,\
      \ the further west it is. So -93.3 is west of -72.5. Therefore, 55425, MN is\
      \ indeed west of 11976, NY.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Sometimes people\
      \ get confused because lower longitudes (less negative) are east, higher (more\
      \ negative) are west. For example, New York is at around -74, while California\
      \ is around -120. So the more negative the longitude (i.e., the higher the absolute\
      \ value west of the Prime Meridian), the further west. So yes, -93 is more west\
      \ than -72. So Minneapolis at -93 would be west of Ridge, NY at -72. So the\
      \ answer is YES.\n</think>To determine if 55425, MN is west of 11976, NY:  \n\
      1. **Zip Code Regions**: MN (starting with **55**) is in the Upper Midwest (5xxx\

      \ that translate to actual longitude? Just because a ZIP code has a higher first\
      \ digit doesn't necessarily mean it's further west. For example, some states\

      \ prime meridian is 0 degrees, and as you go west, the longitude increases in\
      \ the negative direction? Wait, no. Longitude can be east or west. For the United\
      \ States, all the longitudes are west of the prime meridian, so they are expressed\
      \ as degrees west, which would be negative if using the standard coordinate\
      \ system where east is positive. For example, New York is around 74 degrees\
      \ west, which would be -74 degrees in decimal. Minnesota is further west, maybe\
      \ around 93 degrees west (-93). So higher numerical value (without considering\

      \ number (more negative) is further west. Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.\n\
      \nIn terms of absolute degrees west, a higher number means further west. But\
      \ when using the standard decimal system where west longitudes are negative,\
      \ a longitude of -90 is further west than -75. So, for example, if 55425, MN\

      \ would be west of New York. But I need to check the actual longitudes of these\
      \ zip codes.\n\nFirst, I need to find the approximate longitude of zip code\
      \ 55425 in Minnesota. Let me recall. Minnesota is in the Midwest, so it's definitely\

      \ Wait, 55425 is a Minneapolis area zip code. Minneapolis is in the eastern\
      \ part of Minnesota, but still, Minnesota as a state is west of New York. New\
      \ York's zip code 11976... let me think. 11976 is probably in Suffolk County,\
      \ New York, maybe around the eastern part, like the Hamptons? Because 119xx\

      \ on Long Island, which is the eastern part of New York. So comparing Minneapolis,\
      \ MN (55425) to Riverhead, NY (11976), Minneapolis is definitely west of Riverhead.\
      \ Because Minneapolis is in the central part of the US, while New York is on\
      \ the east coast. So the answer should be YES. But let me confirm the longitudes.\n\
      \nAlternatively, maybe I can think of approximate longitudes. New York City\

      \ 55425, MN and 11976, NY. The one with the higher longitude (more west) would\
      \ be further west. Since the Earth's longitude goes from 0 at the prime meridian\
      \ to -180 west and +180 east, in the US, all longitudes are negative because\
      \ they're west of the prime meridian. So, the more negative the longitude, the\
      \ further west the location is. Alternatively, if presented as degrees west\
      \ without the sign, a larger number would mean further west.\n\nWait, but when\
      \ using standard decimal coordinates, in the US, longitude is negative (like\
      \ -73.9857 for New York City). So if 55425 has a longitude that's more west\
      \ (more negative) than 11976's, then 55425 is west of 11976.\n\nBut how do I\

      \ is listed as Manorville, NY. Let me confirm (I might be wrong, but assuming\
      \ my memory). Manorville, NY is in Suffolk County on Long Island. The longitude\
      \ there is around -72.8 or so.\n\nMinnesota's 55425 is in Hennepin County, which\
      \ is Minneapolis area. Minneapolis has a longitude around -93.2. Comparing -93.2\
      \ (55425) and -72.8 (11976), the more negative value (-93.2) is further west.\
      \ Therefore, 55425, MN is indeed west of 11976, NY.\n\nWait, but let me be precise.\
      \ Maybe the specific coordinates for the ZIP codes might differ slightly. Maybe\
      \ 55425 is a suburb of Minneapolis, so roughly same longitude. And 11976 being\

      \ not entirely accurate anymore with all the changes over the years. But as\
      \ a starting point, 94043 is a California ZIP code, which is a West Coast state,\
      \ and 10012 is in New York, which is on the East Coast. But longitude is the\

      \ Is the zip code 94043 in California located west of 10012 in New York? Hmm,\
      \ okay. First, I need to figure out the approximate locations of these two zip\
      \ codes. \n\nStarting with 94043. I know that zip codes starting with 9 are\
      \ generally on the West Coast, which includes California. Specifically, 940\
      \ might be in the San Francisco Bay Area. Maybe somewhere like Sunnyvale or\
      \ Mountain View? I think Sunnyvale's zip code is around 94085 or 94086, but\
      \ 94043... Wait, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe it's another city nearby. Let me recall.\
      \ Oh, right! 94043 is actually Santa Clara, California. Yeah, that sounds right.\
      \ Santa Clara is in the southern part of the Bay Area, near San Jose.\n\nNow,\
      \ 10012 in New York. Zip codes starting with 10 are in New York City. 10012\
      \ is a well-known zip code in Manhattan. Specifically, it's in the Greenwich\
      \ Village area, maybe SoHo or parts of the West Village. So that's in New York\
      \ City, which is on the East Coast of the United States.\n\nNext, I need to\
      \ determine their longitudinal positions. The US is in the Western Hemisphere,\
      \ so longitude decreases as you go west. California is on the West Coast, so\
      \ its longitude should be more west (i.e., a higher negative number if we're\
      \ using the prime meridian as 0). New York is on the East Coast, so its longitude\
      \ is a lower negative number (or even positive if we consider some systems,\
      \ but typically in the US, it's negative for the contiguous states). \n\nLet\
      \ me get approximate longitudes. Santa Clara, CA: I think San Jose's longitude\
      \ is around -121.88. Wait, no, San Francisco is around -122.41, and San Jose\
      \ is a bit south, so maybe around -121.89. But Santa Clara is near San Jose,\
      \ so maybe similar. Let me check in my mind. Alternatively, maybe look up approximate\
      \ coordinates. But since I can't actually look it up, I'll go with what I remember.\
      \ Let's say Santa Clara, CA is approximately -122.03 longitude.\n\nFor New York\
      \ City, specifically Greenwich Village. NYC's longitude is around -74.01. So\
      \ 10012, NY is at approximately -74.01.\n\nComparing the two: -122.03 (Santa\
      \ Clara) vs. -74.01 (NYC). Since longitude decreases as you go west, a more\
      \ negative number means further west. So -122 is more west than -74. Therefore,\
      \ Santa Clara, CA (94043) is indeed west of New York City, NY (10012). \n\n\
      Wait, but I should make sure I didn't mix up the longitudes. Let me confirm.\
      \ The prime meridian is 0, and moving west from there, the longitude becomes\
      \ negative in the Western Hemisphere. So the more negative the longitude, the\
      \ further west. So yes, -122 is west of -74. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n\
      </think>YES  \nTo determine if 94043, CA (Santa Clara) is west of 10012, NY\
      \ (New York City), compare their longitudes:  \n- Santa Clara, CA: ~-122.03\xB0\

    2bafd3d3-0748-4ddc-b5de-b736a9decb6b: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question:\
      \ Is the zip code 94043 in California located west of 10012 in New York? Hmm,\
      \ okay. First, I need to figure out the approximate locations of these two zip\
      \ codes. \n\nStarting with 94043. I know that zip codes starting with 9 are\
      \ generally on the West Coast, so California, Oregon, Washington, etc. Since\
      \ it's 94043, CA, that's definitely in California. I think the 90000 series\
      \ is Southern California, but 940 might be more in the northern part. Wait,\
      \ San Francisco's area codes are around 940? Or maybe Silicon Valley? Let me\
      \ recall. Oh, right, 940 area is part of the South Bay Area. Specifically, 94043\
      \ is Sunnyvale, California. Yeah, that's right. Sunnyvale is in the southern\
      \ part of the Bay Area, near San Jose.\n\nNow, 10012 is a New York zip code.\
      \ New York zip codes starting with 100 are in Manhattan. 10012 is probably Greenwich\
      \ Village or SoHo area. So, comparing the longitudes of Sunnyvale, CA and New\
      \ York City. Since the US spans from east to west, with New York on the East\
      \ Coast and California on the West Coast, generally, California is west of New\
      \ York. But wait, longitude-wise, the further west you go, the lower the longitude\
      \ (since longitude decreases as you go west from the prime meridian). Wait,\
      \ no, actually, in the US, the eastern parts have more negative longitudes if\
      \ we're using the standard of the prime meridian. Wait, no, the US is in the\
      \ western hemisphere, so longitudes are west of the prime meridian, which are\
      \ negative values. So New York is around -74 degrees longitude, and California\
      \ is around -122 degrees. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, longitude for New\
      \ York City is approximately 40.7\xB0 N latitude, 74.0\xB0 W longitude. For\
      \ Sunnyvale, CA, it's around 37.37\xB0 N, 122.04\xB0 W. Wait, but longitude\
      \ is measured from 0\xB0 at Greenwich, going east to 180\xB0 and west to -180\xB0\
      . So New York is at about 74\xB0 W, and Sunnyvale is around 122\xB0 W. Wait,\
      \ but 122\xB0 W is further west than 74\xB0 W. Because as you go west from Greenwich,\
      \ the longitude becomes more negative (or higher in degrees west). So 122\xB0\
      \ W is further west than 74\xB0 W. Therefore, Sunnyvale, CA (94043) is indeed\
      \ west of New York City (10012). \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me confirm\
      \ the exact longitudes. Let me think. New York City's longitude is approximately\
      \ 74.0060\xB0 W. Sunnyvale, CA is around 122.0384\xB0 W. Since 122 is a larger\
      \ number than 74 in the west direction, that means Sunnyvale is further west.\
      \ So yes, 94043, CA is west of 10012, NY. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n\
      </think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Identify Locations:** \
      \ \n   - Zip code 94043 corresponds to Sunnyvale, California.  \n   - Zip code\
      \ 10012 corresponds to New York City (Greenwich Village/SoHo), New York.  \n\
      \n2. **Compare Longitudes:**  \n   - Sunnyvale, CA: ~122.04\xB0 W longitude.\
      \  \n   - New York, NY: ~74.01\xB0 W longitude.  \n\n3. **Determine Direction:**\
      \  \n   A higher numerical value in western longitude (e.g., 122\xB0 W vs. 74\xB0\
      \ W) indicates a location further west. Since 122.04\xB0 W (Sunnyvale) is west\
      \ of 74.01\xB0 W (NYC), **94043, CA is west of 10012, NY**.  \n\n**Answer:**\
      \ YES"
    3724ff82-a54f-4c88-b649-f15f2e7d00eb: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question\
      \ about whether the zip code 94043 in California is west of 10012 in New York.\
      \ Hmm, okay, first, I need to remember that zip codes in the US are assigned\
      \ geographically from the east coast to the west coast. So the lower-numbered\
      \ zip codes are in the east, like New York, and higher numbers are in the west,\
      \ like California. But wait, does that mean all California zip codes are west\
      \ of New York ones just because they have higher numbers? Maybe not exactly,\
      \ because states themselves span a range of longitudes. \n\nSo, maybe I should\
      \ get the actual longitudes of these two zip codes. The longitude determines\
      \ how far east or west a location is. The lower the longitude (more negative\
      \ in the US), the further west it is. Wait, or is it the other way around? Let's\
      \ recall that longitude measures east-west position. The prime meridian is 0\xB0\
      , and locations to the west have negative values (e.g., -118\xB0 for Los Angeles),\
      \ while those east have positive (e.g., New York is around -74\xB0). Wait, no,\
      \ in the US, all longitudes are west of the prime meridian, so they're all negative.\
      \ So New York is around -74\xB0, and California is around -118\xB0 to -122\xB0\
      , depending on the exact location. The more negative the longitude, the further\
      \ west it is. So if 94043 has a longitude more to the west (i.e., a smaller\
      \ number, more negative) than 10012, then the answer is YES.\n\nNow, I need\
      \ to find the longitude of each zip code. Let me think. 94043 is in California.\
      \ Let me recall that. 94043 is probably in the Silicon Valley area. For example,\
      \ cities like Mountain View or Sunnyvale. Yes, quick check: 94043 is Sunnyvale,\
      \ CA. And 10012 is in New York, NY, specifically Greenwich Village in Manhattan.\
      \ \n\nSo I need the longitude of Sunnyvale, CA and New York, NY. From memory,\
      \ New York City's longitude is approximately -74.0060\xB0 (like the coordinates\
      \ for Manhattan). Sunnyvale, CA is in the southern part of the San Francisco\
      \ Bay Area. Its longitude is about -122.0363\xB0. \n\nWait, comparing -122.0363\
      \ (Sunnyvale) and -74.0060 (New York). Since -122 is more negative than -74,\
      \ that means Sunnyvale is indeed further west than New York. Therefore, 94043,\
      \ CA is west of 10012, NY. So the answer should be YES. \n\nBut wait a second,\
      \ maybe I should double-check the exact coordinates. Let me think if I'm mixing\
      \ up any numbers. For example, New York City is at around 40.7128\xB0 N, -74.0060\xB0\
      \ W. Sunnyvale, CA is approximately 37.3688\xB0 N, -122.0363\xB0 W. So yes,\
      \ -122 is more west than -74. So definitely, 94043 is west of 10012. Therefore,\
      \ the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine if 94043, CA is west of 10012, NY:\
      \  \n1. **Longitude Comparison**: The longitude of 10012 (New York, NY) is approximately\
      \ -74.006\xB0, while 94043 (Sunnyvale, CA) is approximately -122.036\xB0.  \n\
      2. **Westward Significance**: Lower (more negative) longitude values indicate\
      \ a location further west.  \n3. **Conclusion**: Since -122.036\xB0 (94043)\
      \ is more negative than -74.006\xB0 (10012), 94043, CA is indeed west of 10012,\
      \ NY.  \n\nANSWER: YES"

      \ I need to figure out the approximate longitudes of both zip codes because\
      \ longitude determines east-west position. \n\nFirst, I know that in the US,\
      \ eastern areas like New York have lower longitude values (more negative if\
      \ we consider west longitudes as negative), while western areas like California\
      \ have higher (less negative or even positive) longitudes. Wait, no, actually,\
      \ the US is in the western hemisphere, so longitudes are west of the prime meridian.\
      \ So, for example, New York is around 74 degrees west, and California is around\
      \ 120 degrees west. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, longitude increases as\
      \ you go west, but in terms of numbers, west longitudes are typically expressed\
      \ as negative numbers. So New York City is around -74 degrees, and California\
      \ is around -122 degrees. Wait, but when comparing west longitude, the more\
      \ negative the longitude, the further west it is. So, for example, -122 is further\
      \ west than -74. So if 94043 is in California, which is further west, its longitude\
      \ would be more negative (or a higher number in west longitude) than New York's.\n\
      \nBut maybe I should look up the actual longitudes. Let me think. Zip code 10012\
      \ is in New York City, probably Manhattan. The approximate longitude of NYC\
      \ is around 74 degrees west, so -74.0. Zip code 94043 is in California. Let\
      \ me recall where 94043 is. I think that's in the Bay Area. Maybe Sunnyvale\
      \ or nearby. Let me confirm. Yes, 94043 is Sunnyvale, CA. The longitude for\
      \ Sunnyvale is approximately 122 degrees west, which is -122.0. \n\nSo comparing\
      \ -122 (Sunnyvale) and -74 (New York), which one is further west? Since -122\
      \ is more west (more negative), that means 94043 is west of 10012. Therefore,\
      \ the answer should be YES.\n</think>To determine if 94043, CA is west of 10012,\
      \ NY:  \n1. **Identify longitudes**:  \n   - 10012 (New York City, NY) is near\
      \ **-74.0\xB0 longitude**.  \n   - 94043 (Sunnyvale, CA) is near **-122.0\xB0\
      \ longitude**.  \n2. **Compare longitudes**: Lower (more negative) longitude\

    86fe61e5-c875-4e30-8dc6-14cdfb64541f: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the zip code 94043 in California is west of 10012 in New York. Hmm,\
      \ I need to figure out the longitude of both places because longitude determines\
      \ east-west position.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that in the US, as you go from the\
      \ East Coast to the West Coast, the longitude becomes more negative because\
      \ the US uses the western hemisphere longitudes. So New York is on the East\
      \ Coast, so its longitude would be around -74 or something, and California is\
      \ on the West Coast, maybe around -122 or so. But I need to get specific for\
      \ these zip codes.\n\nLet me think how to find the longitude for 94043. 94043\
      \ is in California. I think that's the zip code for Sunnyvale or maybe part\
      \ of the Silicon Valley area. Sunnyvale is indeed in the Bay Area. So the longitude\
      \ there would be approximately 122 degrees West. Wait, San Francisco is around\
      \ 122\xB0W, so Sunnyvale being nearby would be similar. Let me confirm. Maybe\
      \ check approximate coordinates: San Jose's longitude is around 121.89\xB0W,\
      \ so Sunnyvale would be close to that, maybe 122.03\xB0W or something.\n\nNow,\
      \ 10012 is a New York zip code. That's in Manhattan, probably Greenwich Village\
      \ or SoHo area. New York City's longitude is around 74\xB0W. For example, Manhattan's\
      \ longitude is approximately -74.006\xB0W. So comparing the two: 94043, CA is\
      \ around -122\xB0W, and 10012, NY is around -74\xB0W. \n\nSince longitude is\
      \ measured from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0), going west from there to the Americas\
      \ means the values are negative when using the decimal degrees system where\
      \ east is positive and west is negative. However, when considering west of a\
      \ location, the more negative the longitude, the further west it is. So -122\xB0\
      \ is more west than -74\xB0 because it's a larger negative number. Wait, but\
      \ actually, when you think of longitude numbers, lower (more negative) values\
      \ are further west. So yes, -122 is west of -74. \n\nSo 94043, CA (longitude\
      \ ~-122) is west of 10012, NY (longitude ~-74). Therefore, the answer should\
      \ be YES.\n</think>YES  \nThe longitude of 94043, CA (approximately -122\xB0\
      ) is farther west than the longitude of 10012, NY (approximately -74\xB0). Since\
      \ lower (more negative) longitudes indicate positions further west in the Western\
      \ Hemisphere, 94043 is indeed west of 10012. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    990eb797-fbd8-41e8-80c7-6a60d18fcfdd: "<think>Alright, I need to figure out if\
      \ the zip code 94043 in California is west of 10012 in New York. Let's start\
      \ by recalling that zip codes in the US are generally assigned from east to\
      \ west, with lower numbers in the east and higher in the west. So, New York,\
      \ being on the East Coast, has zip codes starting with 1, while California,\
      \ on the West Coast, starts with 9. That makes me think that 94043 (starting\
      \ with 9) is indeed west of 10012 (starting with 1). \n\nBut wait, maybe I should\
      \ check the actual longitude coordinates of these zip codes to be sure. Sometimes\
      \ there can be exceptions. Let me think about how to find the longitudes. I\
      \ know that New York City's zip codes, like 10012, are in Manhattan. The longitude\
      \ for NYC is around -74 degrees. For 94043, which is in Sunnyvale, California,\
      \ the longitude is approximately -122 degrees. Since longitude values decrease\
      \ as you go west (with negative numbers in the Western Hemisphere), -122 is\
      \ further west than -74. So, yes, 94043 is west of 10012. \n\nWait, but how\
      \ exactly do the longitudes compare? The prime meridian is 0, and moving west\
      \ from there, the longitudes become negative. The more negative the number,\
      \ the further west it is. So -122 is more west than -74. Therefore, 94043 is\
      \ indeed west of 10012. \n\nAnother way to think about it: California is on\
      \ the West Coast, and New York is on the East Coast. So geographically, all\
      \ of California is west of New York. Therefore, any zip code in CA should be\
      \ west of any zip code in NY. Unless there's some edge case, but I don't think\
      \ so. \n\nSo combining both the zip code numbering logic (9 vs 1) and the actual\
      \ longitudes, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\
      \  \n1. **Zip Code Regions**: US zip codes start with lower numbers in the east\

      \ coast state, most of it should be west of New York.\n\nLet me think about\

      \ The longitude of NYC is around 74 degrees West. For example, the Empire State\
      \ Building is at approximately 73.9857\xB0 W. \n\nNow, zip code 94043 is in\
      \ California. Let me recall where that is. 94043 is Sunnyvale, California. Sunnyvale\
      \ is in the Bay Area, near San Jose. The longitude of Sunnyvale is approximately\
      \ 122.03\xB0 West. Wait, no, that seems too far west. Wait, San Francisco's\
      \ longitude is around 122.4\xB0 W, but Sunnyvale is south of SF, so maybe around\
      \ 122 degrees? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me check my memory. Wait, San\
      \ Francisco is around 122.4\xB0 W, but actually, longitude decreases as you\
      \ go east. Wait, no, longitude west is measured from the prime meridian, so\
      \ higher numbers as you go west. So New York is around 74\xB0 W, California\
      \ is around 120\xB0 W. So 122\xB0 W would be further west than 74\xB0 W. Wait,\
      \ but wait, longitude for the US ranges from about 67\xB0 W (east coast) to\
      \ around 125\xB0 W (west coast). So New York is around 74\xB0 W, and California\
      \ is around 118\xB0 W to 124\xB0 W. So Sunnyvale, CA, which is 94043, is indeed\
      \ west of New York City's 10012. Because 122\xB0 W is west of 74\xB0 W. Wait,\
      \ but longitude west is measured as degrees west of the prime meridian. So higher\

      \ the longitude for 94043. Using my memory, Sunnyvale is in the southern part\
      \ of the San Francisco Bay Area. San Francisco's longitude is around -122.4,\
      \ so Sunnyvale might be a bit south but similar. Maybe around -122.0 to -122.3?\
      \ Let me check... Wait, actually, looking up, Sunnyvale, CA's coordinates are\
      \ approximately 37.37\xB0 N latitude and -122.04\xB0 W longitude.\n\nNow, the\
      \ zip code 10012 in New York. New York City's longitude is around -74.0. Manhattan's\
      \ longitude for Greenwich Village would be roughly -74.0. Let me verify. Yes,\
      \ NYC is around 40.7\xB0 N latitude and -74.0\xB0 W longitude. So, the longitude\
      \ for 10012 is approximately -74.0.\n\nComparing the two longitudes: -122.04\
      \ (Sunnyvale) vs -74.0 (NYC). Since longitude decreases as you go west, the\
      \ more negative the number, the further west it is. So -122 is more west than\
      \ -74. Therefore, 94043, CA is indeed west of 10012, NY.\n</think>YES  \nThe\
      \ zip code 94043 (Sunnyvale, CA) has a longitude of approximately -122.04\xB0\
      , while 10012 (New York, NY) is near -74.00\xB0. Since lower (more negative)\
      \ longitude values indicate locations farther west, 94043 is west of 10012.\

    009f66a4-515c-4a39-be9b-75d47834debb: "<think>Alright, I need to figure out if\
      \ the zip code 90028 in California is west of 11954 in New York. Let me start\
      \ by recalling that zip codes in the US generally increase from east to west,\
      \ but I'm not sure how accurate that is. Maybe I should look up the approximate\
      \ locations of these zip codes. \n\nFirst, 90028 is in California. I know that\
      \ Los Angeles has zip codes starting with 900, so 90028 is probably in LA. Specifically,\
      \ I think 90028 is the zip code for Hollywood, CA. That makes sense because\
      \ Hollywood is part of Los Angeles.\n\nNow, 11954 is a New York zip code. Let\
      \ me think, New York's zip codes for Long Island start with 11... So 11954 should\
      \ be somewhere in Suffolk County. I'll check: a quick mental note, maybe Riverhead?\
      \ Or another town. Let me try to pinpoint it. Wait, 11954 is actually the zip\
      \ code for Westhampton Beach, NY. I think that's on the eastern part of Long\
      \ Island, which is in southeastern New York.\n\nSo now I need to compare the\
      \ longitudes of these two places. Since California is on the West Coast and\
      \ New York is on the East Coast, generally, California is west of New York.\
      \ But specific zip codes can vary. Hollywood, CA (90028) is in southern California,\
      \ near the coast. Westhampton Beach, NY (11954) is on the eastern end of Long\
      \ Island. \n\nThe longitude of Hollywood, CA is approximately 118.33\xB0 W.\
      \ The longitude of Westhampton Beach, NY is around 72.47\xB0 W. Wait, longitude\
      \ west becomes more negative as you go west. But when comparing, the more westward\
      \ location has a higher numerical value in the west longitude. For example,\
      \ 118\xB0 W is further west than 72\xB0 W. So since 118.33\xB0 W (Hollywood)\
      \ is west of 72.47\xB0 W (Westhampton Beach), yes, 90028, CA is west of 11954,\
      \ NY.\n\nWait, no. Wait, longitude values: All longitudes in the Western Hemisphere\
      \ are measured west from the Prime Meridian, so they are negative when using\
      \ the standard coordinate system (where east is positive). But when people refer\
      \ to them as degrees west, they are positive numbers. For example, Los Angeles\
      \ is around 118\xB0W, which is equivalent to -118\xB0 in decimal degrees. But\
      \ when comparing, a longitude of -118\xB0 is further west than -72\xB0, because\
      \ -118 is smaller (more negative) than -72. Wait, no, actually, when moving\
      \ west from the Prime Meridian, the longitude becomes more negative. So a location\
      \ at -118\xB0 is further west than -72\xB0, which is correct. So Hollywood at\
      \ -118.33\xB0 is west of Westhampton Beach at -72.47\xB0. Therefore, yes, 90028\
      \ is west of 11954.\n</think>YES  \nTo determine if 90028, CA (Hollywood, Los\

      \   - Westhampton Beach, NY: ~**-72.47\xB0** (72.47\xB0 W).  \n\n2. **Analysis**:\
      \ Lower (more negative) longitude values are farther west. Since **-118.33\xB0\
      ** is west of **-72.47\xB0**, Hollywood, CA (90028) is unequivocally west of\
      \ Westhampton Beach, NY (11954).  \n\n**Answer**: YES."
    3a7991a9-5be7-4af6-a36f-e0284ed4c9fe: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question:\
      \ Is 90028, CA located west of 11954, NY? Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure\
      \ out the locations of these two zip codes. \n\nStarting with 90028, CA. I know\
      \ that 90028 is a zip code in California. From what I remember, the 90000 series\
      \ zip codes are in Los Angeles. So 90028 is probably somewhere in LA. Let me\
      \ confirm that. Yeah, 90028 is the zip code for the Hollywood area in Los Angeles,\
      \ CA. So that's on the west coast of the US.\n\nNow, 11954, NY. New York zip\
      \ codes... The 11954. I think New York zip codes start with 1, like 100xx for\
      \ NYC, but 11954 might be in Suffolk County. Let me check. Oh right, 11954 is\
      \ the zip code for Wading River, NY. Where is Wading River? It's on Long Island,\
      \ in Suffolk County. So that's on the east coast, around the eastern part of\
      \ Long Island.\n\nNow, the question is whether Hollywood, CA (90028) is west\
      \ of Wading River, NY (11954). To determine this, I need to compare their longitudes.\
      \ Places further west have more negative longitudes (since the US is in the\
      \ western hemisphere). \n\nLooking up the coordinates: Hollywood, CA is approximately\
      \ 34.0928\xB0 N, 118.3287\xB0 W. Wading River, NY is around 40.9459\xB0 N, 72.8369\xB0\
      \ W. \n\nComparing the longitudes: -118.3287 (Hollywood) vs. -72.8369 (Wading\
      \ River). Since longitude is measured from the prime meridian, going west from\
      \ there increases the negative value. So, -118 is more west than -72. Therefore,\
      \ Hollywood, CA is indeed west of Wading River, NY. \n\nWait, but let me make\
      \ sure I didn't mix up the signs. The more negative the longitude, the further\
      \ west it is. So yes, -118 is more west than -72. So 90028, CA is west of 11954,\
      \ NY. The answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \nTo determine if 90028 (Hollywood,\
      \ CA) is west of 11954 (Wading River, NY), compare their longitudes:  \n- **Hollywood,\
      \ CA**: ~118.33\xB0 W  \n- **Wading River, NY**: ~72.84\xB0 W  \n\nSince -118.33\xB0\

      \ out if the zip code 90028 in California is west of 11954 in New York. Hmm,\
      \ I remember that zip codes in the US generally start with numbers that correspond\
      \ to regions. The first digit for the East Coast is lower, like 0 or 1, and\
      \ the West Coast starts with higher numbers like 9. So 90028 is in California,\
      \ which is a 9xxxx zip code, and 11954 is in New York, which is a 1xxxx. So\
      \ just based on the first digit, maybe California is west of New York. But wait,\
      \ maybe the longitude is more precise. Because even within states, zip codes\
      \ can vary in longitude. But maybe 11954 is in eastern New York, which is pretty\
      \ far east, and 90028 is in Los Angeles, which is very west. But how do I know\
      \ the exact longitudes?\n\nAlternatively, I can think of major cities. For example,\
      \ 90028 is Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA. And 11954 is maybe somewhere in Suffolk\
      \ County, New York, like Riverhead? Because I know that New York zip codes starting\
      \ with 11 might be in that area. Let me confirm. So LA is definitely on the\
      \ West Coast, and Suffolk County is on Long Island, which is the eastern part\
      \ of New York. So the longitude of LA is around 118 degrees west, and Long Island\
      \ is around 73 degrees west. Wait, longitude increases as you go west, but the\
      \ actual coordinates: the prime meridian is 0, going east to 180 and west to\
      \ -180. Wait, no, in the US, all longitudes are west, so they're negative. So\
      \ Los Angeles is approximately -118.4, and New York is around -73.9. Since -118.4\
      \ is more west (more negative) than -73.9, yes, 90028 is west of 11954. So the\

    543e6033-3b46-47c9-8c09-ef212667a389: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the zip code 90028 in California is west of 11954 in New York. Hmm.\
      \ First, I need to figure out where these zip codes are located. \n\nStarting\
      \ with 90028, CA. I know that 90028 is in Los Angeles, right? Like the Hollywood\
      \ area maybe. Los Angeles is on the west coast of the US, so its longitude would\
      \ be around 118 degrees west or something. \n\nThen 11954, NY. New York state\
      \ zip codes... 11954, let me think. Maybe it's somewhere in Long Island? For\
      \ example, the Hamptons area? I recall that the eastern part of Long Island\
      \ is pretty far east. The longitude for New York is obviously east, but how\
      \ far? Let's try to get approximate coordinates.\n\nSo, the key here is to compare\
      \ the longitudes. The more west a location is, the lower (more negative) the\
      \ longitude if we're talking about the US. Wait, no, longitude west of the prime\
      \ meridian is measured in negative degrees, like Los Angeles is around -118.\
      \ So if 90028 is in LA, say longitude -118.3, and 11954 in NY, say around -72.8\
      \ (since New York City is about -74, but maybe the eastern part of Long Island\
      \ is further east, so maybe -72?). Wait, longitude for eastern Long Island,\
      \ say Montauk, which is the eastern tip. Checking in my head, NYC is around\
      \ -74. So Montauk would be a bit further east, maybe -72.2 or so. \n\nSo comparing\
      \ -118 (LA) to -72 (NY). Since longitude decreases as you go west, the more\
      \ negative the number, the further west. So -118 is more west than -72. Therefore,\

      , **90028, CA** is indeed west of **11954, NY**.  \n\n**Answer**: YES."
    5bdfc171-c667-419d-879e-d42715c87e34: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question:\
      \ Is 90028, CA located west of 11954, NY?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where\
      \ these two zip codes are located. Starting with 90028. I know that zip codes\
      \ starting with 9 are generally in the western part of the US, like California.\
      \ Specifically, 90028 is a Los Angeles zip code. I've heard that 90028 covers\
      \ areas like Hollywood, so that's in Southern California.\n\nNow, 11954. The\
      \ first three digits are 119, which I think correspond to New York. Let me recall\
      \ that New York zip codes start with 10-11, 12, maybe? So 11954 must be in New\
      \ York. A quick check in my mind\u2014maybe 11954 is somewhere on Long Island.\
      \ I remember that some parts of Suffolk County have zip codes in that range.\
      \ Let me confirm: Suffolk County includes areas like the Hamptons. For example,\
      \ Westhampton Beach is 11978, so 11954 could be nearby. Maybe it's a town like\
      \ Manorville or another part of Suffolk. But the exact town might not matter\
      \ as much as the general location.\n\nNext, I need to determine their longitudinal\
      \ positions. Since the question is about east-west positioning, longitude is\
      \ key. Places with higher longitude (more west) have a more negative value if\
      \ we're using the standard where west longitudes are negative numbers. Wait,\
      \ in the US, longitude decreases as you move west. For example, New York is\
      \ around -73 to -74, while Los Angeles is around -118. But wait, the actual\
      \ longitude values: New York City is roughly 40.7\xB0N latitude, 74\xB0W longitude.\
      \ Los Angeles is around 34\xB0N, 118\xB0W. So LA is further west because 118\xB0\
      W is more west than 74\xB0W. Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Wait, longitude\
      \ is measured from 0\xB0 at Greenwich, increasing east and west up to 180. So\
      \ in the US, all longitudes are west, so they are negative if using the convention\
      \ where east is positive. So New York is around -74\xB0, Los Angeles around\
      \ -118\xB0. The more negative the longitude, the further west. So LA's longitude\
      \ is -118, which is more west than NY's -74. So any location in California would\
      \ be west of New York because California is on the west coast and New York is\
      \ on the east coast.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a case where a zip code in California\
      \ is actually east of a New York one? That seems unlikely. Let me think. The\
      \ continental US spans approximately 67\xB0W to 125\xB0W longitude. So the easternmost\
      \ point in the US is around Maine at -67\xB0W, and the westernmost is Washington\
      \ state around -124\xB0W. New York is around -73\xB0 to -79\xB0 depending on\
      \ the area, while California is around -114\xB0 to -124\xB0. So all of California\
      \ is west of all of New York. Therefore, 90028 (CA) is definitely west of 11954\
      \ (NY). \n\nWait, but is there any possibility that a California zip code could\
      \ be east of a New York one? Probably not. Because even the easternmost part\
      \ of California, like near the Nevada border, would still be around -114\xB0\
      \ to -120\xB0, which is still west of New York's -73\xB0 or so. So even the\
      \ farthest east in California is way west of New York. \n\nTherefore, the answer\
      \ should be YES, 90028, CA is located west of 11954, NY.\n</think>YES  \nThe\
      \ zip code 90028 is in Los Angeles, California, which is on the west coast of\
      \ the US, while 11954 is in New York (specifically in Suffolk County on Long\
      \ Island). Since California is geographically west of New York, **90028, CA**\
      \ is indeed located west of **11954, NY**."
    7e590382-2858-4f73-8fb9-e33eccf94726: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the ZIP code 90028 in California is west of 11954 in New York. Let me start\
      \ by recalling what I know about ZIP codes. \n\nFirst, ZIP codes in the US are\
      \ generally assigned from east to west, with the first digit increasing as you\
      \ move westward. For example, the Northeast starts with 0 or 1, then moving\
      \ to the Midwest with 4-6, and the West Coast with 9. So 90028 starts with a\
      \ 9, which is a West Coast ZIP code, and 11954 starts with 1, which would be\
      \ in the Northeast, like New York. That already suggests that 90028 is indeed\
      \ west of 11954, but maybe I need to check the actual longitudes to be sure.\n\
      \nBut wait, maybe the first digit isn't always a perfect indicator. Some areas\
      \ might have overlapping regions, but I think for the most part, the initial\
      \ digits do correspond to regions. Anyway, even if that's the case, the specific\
      \ ZIP codes are for California and New York. California is definitely on the\
      \ West Coast, and New York is on the East Coast. So geographically, California\
      \ is west of New York. But ZIP codes can sometimes cross state lines or be in\
      \ different parts of a state. Wait, but 90028 is in California. Let me think\
      \ where exactly. 90028 is a Los Angeles ZIP code, specifically the Hollywood\
      \ area. And 11954 is in New York. Let me check where 11954 is exactly. Quick\
      \ search in my mind... 11954 is in Suffolk County, New York, which is on Long\
      \ Island. So places like Riverhead or maybe the Hamptons? Either way, Long Island\
      \ is the eastern part of New York. \n\nSo Los Angeles, CA (90028) is on the\
      \ West Coast, and Suffolk County, NY (11954) is on the East Coast. But longitude-wise,\
      \ the West Coast has a more western longitude (more negative if we consider\
      \ the prime meridian). For example, Los Angeles is around 118 degrees West longitude,\
      \ and New York is around 73 degrees West. Wait, no. Wait, longitude for New\
      \ York City is about 74 degrees West, and Los Angeles is around 118 degrees\
      \ West. Wait, but longitude is measured from the prime meridian in Greenwich,\
      \ so locations in the US have negative values when west of Greenwich. But when\
      \ comparing east and west within the US, lower numerical values (more east in\
      \ the US) are east, higher numerical values (more west) are west. Wait, but\
      \ actually west longitude increases as you go west. So New York is around 73\xB0\
      \ W, and Los Angeles is around 118\xB0 W. Wait, but longitude west means that\
      \ as you go west, the numbers increase. So Los Angeles is further west (higher\
      \ west longitude number), so it's west of New York. \n\nTherefore, since 90028\
      \ in CA is at a more westerly longitude than 11954 in NY, the answer should\
      \ be YES. But wait, the ZIP code 11954 is in eastern Long Island, which is even\
      \ further east than New York City. But in terms of longitude, even the eastern\
      \ tip of Long Island is around 72\xB0 W. For example, Montauk is at about 71.95\xB0\
      \ W. So if Los Angeles is at 118.25\xB0 W, then yes, 118 is west of 72. Wait,\
      \ but longitude is measured as degrees west of the prime meridian, so a higher\
      \ number (like 118) is further west than a lower number (like 72). Therefore,\
      \ 90028 (CA) is indeed west of 11954 (NY). \n\nSo the answer must be YES.\n\
      </think>YES  \nZIP code 90028 corresponds to Hollywood, California, which is\
      \ located at approximately 118.33\xB0 W longitude. ZIP code 11954 is in Riverhead,\
      \ New York, near the eastern end of Long Island, at approximately 72.62\xB0\

      \ longitude determines east-west position. \n\nFirst, I know that in the US,\

      \ negative numbers (further from zero) are more west. So a ZIP code in California\
      \ would have a more western (more negative) longitude than one in New York.\
      \ Therefore, if 90028 in CA has a longitude that's less (more negative) than\
      \ 11954 in NY, then yes, it's west.\n\nNow, let me think about specific locations.\
      \ ZIP code 90028 is in Los Angeles, probably Hollywood area. Let me confirm.\
      \ Yes, 90028 is Hollywood, CA. The longitude for Hollywood is approximately\
      \ -118.3286. \n\nFor 11954 in NY, I need to check where that is. Let's see.\
      \ 11954 is in New York. Looking up, I think 11954 is in Suffolk County, maybe\
      \ around the eastern part. Wait, Suffolk County is on Long Island. Let me check\
      \ a ZIP code lookup. 11954 corresponds to Mattituck, NY. Mattituck is on the\
      \ North Fork of Long Island. Its coordinates are approximately latitude 40.9918,\
      \ longitude -72.5342. \n\nNow, comparing the longitudes: -118.3286 (90028) vs.\
      \ -72.5342 (11954). Since -118 is more negative than -72, that means 90028 is\
      \ further west. Because the more negative the longitude, the further west it\
      \ is. So yes, 90028, CA is west of 11954, NY.\n</think>YES  \nThe longitude\
      \ of ZIP code 90028 (Hollywood, CA) is approximately -118.33, while that of\
      \ 11954 (Mattituck, NY) is around -72.53. Since lower (more negative) longitudes\
      \ indicate positions further west, 90028 is indeed west of 11954."
    cd16fc19-a181-4dd5-9ab1-0676a1c46681: "<think>Alright, so I need to figure out\
      \ if the zip code 90028 in California is located west of 11954 in New York.\
      \ Let me start by recalling that zip codes in the US are generally assigned\
      \ from east to west, with lower numbers in the east and higher in the west.\
      \ But I'm not sure how accurate that is for specific locations. \n\nFirst, I\
      \ should probably confirm the locations of both zip codes. Let me think about\
      \ California's zip codes. 90028 is a Los Angeles zip code, specifically the\
      \ Hollywood area. New York's 11954 might be somewhere in Long Island, maybe\
      \ around Suffolk County? Wait, I'm not certain. To be sure, maybe I should check\
      \ the approximate longitude of both places.\n\nLongitude is the key here because\
      \ west vs east is determined by how far west (higher negative longitude) a place\
      \ is. The more west a location is, the more negative its longitude (in the US).\
      \ So, if 90028 has a more western longitude (more negative) than 11954, then\
      \ the answer is YES.\n\nBut how do I get the longitudes without looking it up?\
      \ Maybe I can think of general geography. Los Angeles is on the west coast,\
      \ so its longitude is around -118 degrees. New York state, particularly Long\
      \ Island where 11954 is probably located, is around -73 degrees. Wait, wait\u2014\
      no, New York City is around -74 degrees. But 11954 might be further east on\
      \ Long Island. For example, places like Riverhead or even further east. Let's\
      \ say somewhere around -72.5 degrees. \n\nWait, but Los Angeles is around -118,\
      \ which is much more west than -72. So, 90028 (LA) is definitely west of 11954\
      \ (NY). Therefore, the answer should be YES. But maybe I should double-check.\
      \ \n\nAlternatively, maybe 11954 is in upstate New York? Wait, no. 11954 is\
      \ actually in Calverton, NY. Let me confirm. Calverton is indeed in Suffolk\
      \ County, Long Island, NY. Its longitude is approximately -72.7 degrees. Los\
      \ Angeles (90028) is around -118.3 degrees. Since -118.3 is west (more negative)\

      \ longitude values indicate locations further west, 90028 is indeed west of\
      \ 11954.  \n\nAnswer: YES"
    d8703442-a3ac-4d8b-9c57-1210da08d2d7: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure out if\
      \ the zip code 90028 in California is west of 11954 in New York. I'm not super\
      \ familiar with zip code geography, but I can break this down step by step.\n\
      \nFirst, I know that zip codes in the US are generally assigned from east to\
      \ west. The eastern states like New York have lower starting numbers, while\
      \ the western states like California have higher ones. For example, New York\
      \ zip codes start with '1' and California with '9'. So 90028 is in CA and 11954\
      \ is in NY. That already suggests CA is west of NY, but maybe specific locations\
      \ within the states could vary? But the main thing is that California is on\
      \ the west coast and New York is on the east coast. So in general, any place\
      \ in California should be west of any place in New York. But wait, maybe there's\
      \ an exception? Like a part of New York that's further west than parts of California?\
      \ Let me think about the geography.\n\nNew York state's longitude: the westernmost\
      \ part of New York is around Lake Erie, near cities like Buffalo. The longitude\
      \ there is approximately -79 degrees. California's eastern border is around\
      \ -114 degrees, but Los Angeles, where 90028 is (I think 90028 is Hollywood\
      \ area), is around -118 degrees longitude. Wait, longitude is measured from\
      \ the prime meridian, with west longitudes being negative. So more negative\
      \ means further west. So if 90028 is at, say, -118.3, and 11954 in NY is at\
      \ maybe -73 or so (since New York City is around -74), then yes, -118 is more\
      \ west than -74. But if the NY zip code 11954 is in a western part of NY, maybe\
      \ near Buffalo at -79, then -79 is still east compared to -118. So even the\
      \ westernmost part of NY is at around -79, while LA is at -118. So LA is much\
      \ further west. Therefore, yes, 90028, CA is west of 11954, NY. \n\nWait, let\
      \ me confirm the exact locations. Let me check where 11954 is. 11954 is a NY\
      \ zip code. Looking up, 11954 is probably in Suffolk County, maybe near Riverhead\
      \ or the eastern part of Long Island. For example, 11954 is listed as Westhampton,\
      \ NY. Long Island's longitude is around -72.8 to -73.5 degrees. So Westhampton\
      \ would be around -72.8. Then 90028 is Hollywood, CA, which is around -118.3.\
      \ So comparing -118.3 (CA) to -72.8 (NY), CA is definitely west. Since west\
      \ longitude is measured as negative, the lower the number (more negative), the\
      \ further west. So -118 is further west than -72. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n\
      </think>YES  \nThe zip code 90028 (Hollywood, CA) is located at approximately\
      \ -118.3\xB0 longitude, while 11954 (Westhampton, NY) is around -72.8\xB0 longitude.\
      \ Since lower (more negative) longitude values indicate locations further west,\
      \ California's 90028 is indeed west of New York's 11954."

      \ Is the zip code 90028 in California located west of 11954 in New York? Hmm,\
      \ okay, so first, I need to figure out where these zip codes are. \n\nStarting\
      \ with 90028. I know that in the US, zip codes starting with 9 are generally\
      \ on the West Coast. California is a big state, but 90028... Wait, that's familiar.\
      \ Isn't 90028 the zip code for the Hollywood area in Los Angeles? Yeah, that\

      \ I need to determine the longitude of both locations. Because the question\
      \ is about east-west position. The further west a place is, the more west it\
      \ is if its longitude is a larger negative number (since in the US, longitudes\
      \ are west of the prime meridian, so they're negative). \n\nLos Angeles (90028)\
      \ is around 118.25\xB0W longitude. Calverton, NY (11954) is roughly 72.75\xB0\
      W. Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, wait\u2014that can't be right. Wait, New York is\
      \ on the East Coast, so its longitude is around 73\xB0W. Los Angeles is around\
      \ 118\xB0W. So wait, when comparing longitudes, the lower the numerical value\
      \ (less negative), the more east a location is. So 73\xB0W (New York) is actually\
      \ a smaller number (closer to 0) than 118\xB0W (Los Angeles). Wait, but since\
      \ longitude increases towards the west, so Los Angeles is further west because\
      \ 118\xB0W is west of 73\xB0W. Wait, but wait: No, the longitude for New York\
      \ is around 73\xB0W, which is about 73 degrees west of the prime meridian. Los\
      \ Angeles is around 118\xB0W. So 118 is a larger number west, so Los Angeles\
      \ is further west. So 90028 (LA) is west of 11954 (NY). Therefore, the answer\
      \ is YES. \n\nWait, wait a second. Let me confirm. If a place is at 118\xB0\
      W, that's 118 degrees west. A place at 73\xB0W is 73 degrees west. So comparing\
      \ the two, 118\xB0 is further west than 73\xB0 because it's a higher number\
      \ west. So yes, Los Angeles is west of New York. Therefore, 90028, CA is west\
      \ of 11954, NY. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \nTo determine if\
      \ 90028 (Los Angeles, CA) is west of 11954 (Calverton, NY), compare their longitudes:\

      \ The zip code 10036 is in New York City, probably Manhattan. And 90265 is Malibu,\

      \ City.\n\nBut ZIP codes aren't exact for coordinates, so I need to get more\
      \ specific. Let me think about where these ZIP codes are. 90265 is Malibu, California.\
      \ Malibu is a coastal city in Southern California, right along the Pacific Ocean.\
      \ On the other hand, 10036 is a ZIP York City, which York City, which York City,\

      \ some areas might be further east or west. But 90265 \u2013 let me check where\
      \ that is exactly. Wait, 90265 is Malibu, California. Malibu is along the coast,\
      \ so that's definitely in the western part of California. \n\nNew York's 10036\
      \ is in Manhattan, which is around the southern part of New York State. The\
      \ longitude for Manhattan is roughly around 74 degrees west. Malibu, CA, on\
      \ the other hand, is around 118 degrees west. Since longitude increases as you\
      \ go west (but actually, going west from the prime meridian, the degrees increase\
      \ up to 180, but in the US, all longitudes are west, so higher numbers are further\
      \ west). Wait, no. Wait, longitude is measured from 0 at the prime meridian\
      \ (Greenwich) going east to 180 and west to 180. So for the US, all locations\
      \ are west of the prime meridian, meaning their longitudes are west, from about\
      \ 70 (East Coast) to around 125 (West Coast). So the longitude of New York is\
      \ around 74\xB0 W, and Los Angeles area is about 118\xB0 W. The higher the degrees\
      \ west, the further west the location. So Malibu, CA at 118\xB0 W is definitely\
      \ west of New York City at 74\xB0 W. Therefore, yes, 90265, CA is west of 10036,\
      \ NY.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **ZIP Code Locations**:\
      \  \n   - 90265 corresponds to Malibu, California.  \n   - 10036 corresponds\
      \ to Manhattan, New York.  \n\n2. **Longitude Comparison**:  \n   - Malibu,\
      \ CA, is at approximately **118.7\xB0 W** longitude.  \n   - Manhattan, NY,\
      \ is at approximately **73.9\xB0 W** longitude.  \n\n3. **Conclusion**:  \n\
      \   Since 118.7\xB0 W (Malibu) is further west than 73.9\xB0 W (Manhattan),\
      \ **90265, CA is west of 10036, NY**.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    94d222a6-da41-46b9-b88a-bf8bc6c41c14: "<think>Alright, let's try to figure out\
      \ if the zip code 90265 in California is west of 10036 in New York. Okay, first,\
      \ I know that zip codes in the US are assigned geographically from east to west.\
      \ So the lower numbers start in the northeast and increase as you move west\
      \ and south. For example, states like Maine and New York have lower zip codes,\
      \ while California and Hawaii have higher ones.\n\nWait, but the question is\
      \ about specific zip codes. So 90265 is in CA, and 10036 is in NY. Let me check\
      \ where exactly these zip codes are located. Zip code 10036 is in New York City,\
      \ probably Manhattan, maybe around the Theater District or Midtown. On the other\
      \ hand, 90265 is in California. Let me recall, the 90000 series zip codes are\
      \ in Southern California. Specifically, 90265 is Malibu, right? Malibu is a\
      \ coastal city west of Los Angeles.\n\nNow, I need to determine the longitude\
      \ of both places because longitude determines east-west position. The further\
      \ west a location is (higher negative longitude in the US), the more west it\
      \ is. So, New York City is around -74.0060\xB0 longitude, and Malibu, CA is\
      \ approximately -118.8065\xB0 longitude. Comparing those, -118.8 is more west\
      \ than -74.0 because it's a larger negative number. Wait, no, actually, when\
      \ dealing with longitude, negative values are west of the Prime Meridian. So,\
      \ the more negative the longitude, the further west. So since -118 is more negative\
      \ than -74, Malibu is definitely west of New York City. \n\nBut wait, maybe\
      \ I should double-check the exact coordinates. Let me think. New York City's\
      \ longitude is roughly around 74 degrees west, which is -74.0. Malibu's longitude\
      \ is about 118 degrees west, which is -118.8. Since 118 is west of 74, that\
      \ means Malibu is west of New York. Therefore, 90265, CA is west of 10036, NY.\
      \ So the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Reasoning:**  \n1. **Zip Code\
      \ Locations**: 90265 corresponds to Malibu, CA, while 10036 is in New York City,\
      \ NY.  \n2. **Longitude Comparison**:  \n   - New York City (10036) longitude:\
      \ ~-74.0\xB0  \n   - Malibu (90265) longitude: ~-118.8\xB0  \n3. **West Determination**:\
      \ Lower (more negative) longitude means further west. Since -118.8\xB0 < -74.0\xB0\
      , Malibu is west of NYC.  \n\n**Answer**: YES."
    9b631491-7db9-482c-bb87-3a05298b113c: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question:\
      \ Is the ZIP code 90265 in California located west of 10036 in New York? I need\
      \ to figure out if 90265, CA is west of 10036, NY. \n\nFirst, I remember that\
      \ ZIP codes in the US are generally assigned from east to west. The lower numbers\
      \ start on the East Coast, like in New York and Maine, and then they increase\
      \ as you move westward. So, for example, New York has ZIP codes starting with\
      \ '1', which makes sense because it's on the East Coast. California, being on\
      \ the West Coast, should have higher ZIP codes, maybe starting with '9'. \n\n\
      Looking at the two ZIP codes given: 90265 and 10036. Let me break them down.\
      \ The first digit of a ZIP code represents a group of states. The '9' in 90265\
      \ suggests it's in the western part of the US, likely California. The '10' in\
      \ 10036\u2014wait, actually, the first three digits of the ZIP code are the\
      \ sectional center facility (SCF). Wait, no, the first digit is the national\
      \ area, then the next two digits are the region. So, the first digit '1' would\
      \ be for the Northeast, like New York, and '9' would be the West, including\
      \ California. \n\nBut maybe I should verify the actual locations. ZIP code 10036\
      \ is in New York, specifically Manhattan. I think that's around the Times Square\
      \ area. So New York City is on the East Coast. \n\nNow, 90265 is in California.\
      \ Let me recall which part. ZIP codes starting with 902 are in the Los Angeles\
      \ area. For example, 90210 is Beverly Hills. So 90265 might be nearby. Let me\
      \ check\u2014Malibu's ZIP code is 90265. Yes, Malibu, CA, which is on the coast,\
      \ west of Los Angeles. \n\nSo now, to determine if Malibu, CA (90265) is west\
      \ of New York City (10036). Since the US is in the Northern Hemisphere, longitude\
      \ decreases as you go west. But more importantly, all of California is west\
      \ of New York. The prime meridian is in Greenwich, UK, so the US has longitudes\
      \ west of that. New York is around 74 degrees west longitude, and Los Angeles\
      \ is around 118 degrees west longitude. The more west the longitude (higher\
      \ number in negative terms), the further west the location. Wait, no, longitude\
      \ goes from 0 at Greenwich to 180 east and west. So in the US, all longitudes\
      \ are west, so they're negative if we consider the convention. For example,\
      \ New York City is approximately -74.0060, and Los Angeles is around -118.2437.\
      \ So numerically, -118 is less (more negative) than -74, but in terms of actual\
      \ position, Los Angeles is further west.\n\nTherefore, since Malibu is in California,\
      \ which is on the West Coast, and New York is on the East Coast, Malibu (90265)\
      \ is indeed west of New York City (10036). So the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES\
      \  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **ZIP Code Regions:** ZIP codes starting\
      \ with '9' (e.g., 90265) are in the western U.S., including California. ZIP\
      \ codes starting with '1' (e.g., 10036) are in the northeastern U.S., including\
      \ New York.  \n2. **Locations Identified:**  \n   - 90265 corresponds to Malibu,\
      \ CA (~longitude **-118.81\xB0**).  \n   - 10036 corresponds to Manhattan, NY\
      \ (~longitude **-73.99\xB0**).  \n3. **Longitude Comparison:** Lower (more negative)\
      \ longitude values are further west. Malibu's longitude (-118.81\xB0) is significantly\
      \ farther west than Manhattan's (-73.99\xB0).  \n**Conclusion:** 90265, CA (Malibu)\
      \ is west of 10036, NY (Manhattan)."
    a55fbef4-e21e-4b10-8aac-2740cd4ee211: "<think>Okay, let's figure out if the zip\
      \ code 90265 in California is west of 10036 in New York. Hmm, first I need to\
      \ know where these zip codes are located. \n\nStarting with 90265, CA. I remember\
      \ that zip codes starting with 9 are generally on the West Coast. California\
      \ is definitely a western state, so 90265 is probably somewhere in Southern\
      \ California. Maybe Malibu? I think Malibu's zip code is around there. Let me\
      \ check... Wait, 90265 is indeed Malibu, CA.\n\nNow, 10036 is a New York zip\
      \ code. New York City zip codes often start with 100, so 10036 must be in Manhattan.\
      \ Specifically, I think that's around the Theater District or Midtown. Confirming,\
      \ yes, 10036 is in New York, NY, which is in the eastern part of the US.\n\n\
      Next, comparing their longitudes. The key here is to see which location has\
      \ a more western longitude (more west means a higher negative number if we're\
      \ using the standard coordinate system where longitude decreases as you go west\
      \ in the US). \n\nLooking up the coordinates: Malibu, CA (90265) is approximately\
      \ at around 118.81\xB0W longitude. New York City (10036) is around 73.98\xB0\
      W. Since 118.81\xB0W is further west than 73.98\xB0W (because the numbers are\
      \ more negative going west), that means Malibu is west of NYC. \n\nWait, but\
      \ longitude west is measured in degrees west of the prime meridian. So a higher\
      \ numerical value (like 118 vs 73) means further west. So yes, 118.81 is west\
      \ of 73.98. Therefore, 90265 (CA) is indeed west of 10036 (NY).\n</think>YES\
      \  \nThe zip code 90265 (Malibu, CA) is located at approximately 118.81\xB0\
      W longitude, while 10036 (New York, NY) is at 73.98\xB0W. Since 118.81\xB0W\
      \ is farther west than 73.98\xB0W, **90265, CA is west of 10036, NY**."
    c6df7f1f-80a5-467a-93e8-baebc6eef0b7: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the zip code 90265 in California is west of 10036 in New York. Hmm,\
      \ I need to figure out the approximate longitudes of both zip codes because\
      \ longitude determines east-west positioning. The one with the more western\
      \ longitude (more negative if we're using the standard where west of the Prime\
      \ Meridian is negative) would be further west.\n\nFirst, I should recall that\
      \ California is on the west coast of the US, and New York is on the east coast.\
      \ So generally, California is west of New York. But zip codes can vary a bit\
      \ within a state. However, 90265 is a California zip code. Let me confirm where\
      \ exactly 90265 is. I think 90265 is Malibu, CA. Malibu is along the coast,\
      \ so that's pretty far west. \n\nThen 10036 in New York. New York City zip codes,\
      \ like 10036, are in Manhattan. 10036 is around the Theater District, maybe\
      \ Times Square area. So Manhattan is on the east coast, so its longitude would\
      \ be around -74 degrees. \n\nNow, Malibu, CA's longitude is approximately -118.8\
      \ degrees. New York City's longitude is around -73.9 degrees. Since longitude\
      \ lines go from -180 to +180, with more negative being further west. So -118.8\

      \ values are further west in the US, while higher ones are further east.\n\n\
      First, I'll start by recalling what I know about zip codes. Zip codes in the\
      \ US are assigned geographically, with the first digit representing a group\
      \ of states. For example, zip codes starting with 9 are generally on the West\
      \ Coast, which includes California. New York's zip codes start with 1, so 10036\
      \ is in the Northeast. That gives me a rough idea, but I need specific longitudes.\n\
      \nNext, I need to find the approximate longitude of each zip code. 90265 is\
      \ in California. I think that Los Angeles area zip codes are around there. Malibu,\

      \ City zip code, specifically in Manhattan. The longitude for NYC is around\

      \ would be close to that, say around -74.0.\n\nComparing the two longitudes:\
      \ -118.8 (90265) vs. -74.0 (10036). Since longitude lines decrease as you go\

      \ Maybe I can think of another reference point. The Grand Canyon is around 112\xB0\

      \ to 87\xB0W (western panhandle). Nevada's longitude ranges from about 114\xB0\
      W to 120\xB0W. So, Nevada is further west. Therefore, any zip code in Nevada\
      \ should be west of any zip code in Florida. But maybe I should check specific\
      \ zip codes.\n\nLooking up zip code 89109: this is in Las Vegas, NV. The approximate\
      \ longitude for Las Vegas is around 115.14\xB0W. For zip code 33139, which is\
      \ in Miami Beach, FL. Miami's longitude is approximately 80.13\xB0W. Wait, but\
      \ 115\xB0W is more west than 80\xB0W? Wait, no. Wait, when we measure west longitude,\
      \ higher numerical values (more west) are actually further west. Wait, here's\
      \ the confusion: In terms of degrees west, 115\xB0W is further west than 80\xB0\
      W because 115 is a larger number than 80. But wait, longitude is measured from\
      \ 0\xB0 (prime meridian) going east to 180\xB0E and west to 180\xB0W. However,\
      \ when using negative values for west longitudes, -115\xB0 (which is 115\xB0\
      W) is more west than -80\xB0 (80\xB0W). So, numerically, -115 is less than -80,\
      \ but in terms of actual position, 115\xB0W is west of 80\xB0W. So, Las Vegas\
      \ at 115\xB0W is indeed west of Miami at 80\xB0W.\n\nTherefore, 89109, NV (Las\
      \ Vegas) is west of 33139, FL (Miami Beach). So the answer should be YES. But\
      \ wait, just to be thorough, maybe check the exact coordinates. I might be misremembering\
      \ the exact longitudes.\n\nAlternatively, think about the map. Florida is on\
      \ the east coast, and Nevada is in the southwest. So, moving from Florida to\
      \ Nevada, you go west. So any point in Nevada is definitely west of Florida.\
      \ Therefore, yes, 89109 NV is west of 33139 FL.\n</think>YES  \nTo determine\
      \ if 89109, NV is west of 33139, FL:  \n1. **Longitudes** are key for east-west\

      \ the western hemisphere.  \n2. **89109, NV** (Las Vegas) has a longitude of\
      \ approximately **-115.14\xB0**, while **33139, FL** (Miami Beach) is around\
      \ **-80.13\xB0**.  \n3. Since **-115.14\xB0** is further west than **-80.13\xB0\
      **, the Nevada zip code is west of the Florida zip code.  \n\nANSWER: YES"

      \ east-west positioning. The further west a location is (the more negative the\
      \ longitude if we're using the standard coordinate system where the prime meridian\
      \ is 0), the more west it is.\n\nFirst, I should find the longitude for 89109,\
      \ NV. I know that Nevada is a state in the western US, so its longitude should\
      \ be around -115 to -120 maybe. Let me think, Las Vegas is in Nevada, and the\
      \ ZIP code 89109 is a part of Las Vegas. I remember that Las Vegas is around\
      \ 36.1699\xB0 N latitude and -115.1398\xB0 W longitude. So 89109 would be approximately\
      \ -115.14 longitude.\n\nThen, for 33139, FL. Florida is on the east coast, so\
      \ its longitude should be more eastern, which would be a less negative number.\
      \ Miami Beach, for example, is in Florida. The ZIP code 33139 is in Miami Beach.\
      \ Miami's coordinates are roughly 25.7617\xB0 N, -80.1918\xB0 W. So the longitude\
      \ here is around -80.19.\n\nNow, comparing the two longitudes: -115.14 (NV)\
      \ vs. -80.19 (FL). Since longitude is measured from the prime meridian, going\
      \ west from there gives negative values in the western hemisphere. The more\
      \ negative the longitude, the further west. So -115 is more west than -80. Therefore,\
      \ 89109, NV is indeed west of 33139, FL. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because\
      \ -115 is more west than -80, yes. For example, the US becomes more west as\
      \ you go from the east coast (like Florida at around -80) to the west coast\
      \ (like California around -120). Nevada is in between, but Las Vegas is at -115,\

      \ Las Vegas is around 115 degrees west longitude. Let me check that... Yeah,\
      \ I think the coordinates for Las Vegas are approximately 36.1699\xB0 N latitude\

      \ Miami Beach's coordinates are approximately 25.7935\xB0 N, 80.1392\xB0 W.\
      \ So 33139 would be around 80.14\xB0 W.\n\nComparing the two longitudes: 115.14\xB0\
      \ W (NV) vs. 80.14\xB0 W (FL). Since west longitude is measured as negative\
      \ numbers, the more negative (or higher in absolute value) the longitude, the\
      \ further west it is. So 115.14\xB0 W is more west than 80.14\xB0 W. Therefore,\
      \ 89109, NV is indeed west of 33139, FL. \n\nWait, but I should make sure I\

      \ (in the Western Hemisphere). So a place at 100\xB0 W is further west than\

      \ (0\xB0) going east to 180\xB0 and west to -180\xB0. So for the US, which is\
      \ in the western hemisphere, longitudes are negative numbers. For example, New\
      \ York is around -74\xB0, Los Angeles around -118\xB0. So the more negative\
      \ the longitude, the further west it is. So a ZIP code with a longitude of -120\xB0\

      \ (FL), I need their longitudes. Let me try to remember or think of approximate\
      \ locations. Nevada is a western state, so its ZIP codes should have more western\

    bb4236c1-4047-4df1-a798-4794070cd515: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the zip code 89109 in Nevada is west of the zip code 33139 in Florida. Let's\
      \ start by recalling that zip codes in the US correspond to specific regions,\
      \ generally from the east coast to the west coast, with lower numbers starting\
      \ in the northeast and higher numbers as you move west and south. But I'm not\
      \ entirely sure how precise that is for individual zip codes.\n\nFirst, I should\
      \ probably confirm the general locations of these two zip codes. Let me start\
      \ with 89109, NV. Nevada is in the western US, and Las Vegas is a major city\
      \ there. I think 89109 is a Las Vegas zip code. Let me check that. A quick mental\
      \ note: Las Vegas zip codes start with 89... so that makes sense. Now, 33139,\
      \ FL. Florida is on the east coast, and 33139 is likely in Miami since Miami\
      \ zip codes often start with 331. So 33139 is probably Miami Beach or somewhere\
      \ in that area.\n\nNext, I need to compare their longitudes because west means\
      \ a more negative longitude (or higher numerical value west of the Prime Meridian\
      \ if we consider absolute values). The key here is determining which location\
      \ has a more western longitude. Let's get approximate longitudes for both zip\
      \ codes.\n\nFor Las Vegas, NV (zip 89109): The approximate longitude of Las\
      \ Vegas is around -115.17 degrees. For Miami, FL (zip 33139): The approximate\
      \ longitude is around -80.19 degrees. Since longitude values decrease as you\
      \ go west from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0), a more negative value is further\
      \ west. So -115.17 is more west than -80.19. Therefore, Las Vegas, NV (89109)\

      \ For example, maybe 89109 is in the eastern part of Las Vegas, and 33139 is\
      \ in the western part of Miami. But given that Las Vegas as a whole is much\
      \ further west than Miami, even if the specific zip code is on the eastern edge\
      \ of Las Vegas, it would still be west of Miami's westernmost point. Let's think\
      \ about the approximate ranges. Las Vegas's longitude is roughly between -115.30\
      \ and -115.00. Miami's longitude is roughly between -80.31 and -80.10. Comparing\
      \ the westernmost point of Las Vegas (-115.30) to the westernmost point of Miami\

    0cdea145-f365-4910-afad-306b163bcfaa: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question:\
      \ Is 94027, CA located west of 10019, NY? Hmm, I need to figure out the longitude\
      \ of both zip codes because longitude determines east-west position. The higher\
      \ the longitude, the further west a location is if we're talking about the western\
      \ hemisphere. Wait, no\u2014longitude in the US is measured west from the Prime\
      \ Meridian. So places in the US have negative longitude values. For example,\
      \ California is around -120 to -118, while New York is around -74 or so. Since\
      \ longitude increases to the west in negative terms, a smaller negative number\
      \ (closer to zero) is actually more east. So if 94027, CA has a longitude that's\
      \ more west (more negative) than 10019, NY, then yes, it's west. But wait, let\
      \ me confirm.\n\nFirst, I need the exact longitude for both zip codes. Let me\
      \ recall: 94027 is a zip code in California. I think it's in the Bay Area. Atherton,\
      \ maybe? Atherton, CA is 94027. Then 10019 is a New York zip code, which is\
      \ in Manhattan, like the Midtown area. So Atherton, CA is in the San Francisco\
      \ Bay Area, and 10019 is in NYC.\n\nNow, checking the approximate longitudes.\
      \ New York City's longitude is roughly around -74.0060. For example, the Empire\
      \ State Building is around -73.9855. The 10019 area might be around there. Atherton,\
      \ CA's longitude is approximately -122.1964. \n\nComparing the two: Atherton's\
      \ longitude is -122.20, and NYC's is about -74. So -122 is more negative than\
      \ -74. Since longitude west of the Prime Meridian is negative, the more negative\
      \ value is further west. Therefore, Atherton, CA (94027) is indeed west of New\
      \ York City (10019). \n\nWait, but wait: when comparing longitudes, if one location\
      \ has a lower (more negative) longitude than another, it's located further west.\
      \ Because each degree west increases the negative value. So -122 is west of\
      \ -74 because it's further from the Prime Meridian in the western direction.\
      \ So yes, 94027, CA is west of 10019, NY. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>To\
      \ determine if 94027, CA (Atherton) is west of 10019, NY (New York City), compare\
      \ their longitudes:\n\n- **Atherton, CA (94027)**: Approximately **-122.20\xB0\
      **  \n- **New York City, NY (10019)**: Approximately **-74.00\xB0**\n\nSince\
      \ **-122.20\xB0** is more negative than **-74.00\xB0**, Atherton is farther\
      \ west.  \n\nANSWER: YES"
    10f94164-37a2-4027-9f88-3bf6a813834e: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the zip code 94027 in California is west of 10019 in New York. Let me start\
      \ by recalling that zip codes in the US are generally assigned from east to\
      \ west, with lower numbers in the east and higher as you go west. But I'm not\
      \ sure if that's entirely accurate or if there are exceptions. So maybe I shouldn't\
      \ rely solely on that.\n\nFirst, I should determine the locations of these two\
      \ zip codes. 94027 is in California, and 10019 is in New York. Since California\
      \ is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, my initial thought\
      \ is that California is definitely west of New York. But zip codes can sometimes\
      \ cross state lines or be in different parts of a state. Wait, 94027\u2014I\
      \ think that's in the San Francisco Bay Area. Let me confirm. Maybe it's Atherton\
      \ or Menlo Park? Yeah, Atherton, CA uses 94027. And 10019 is a New York City\
      \ zip code, probably Manhattan, like Midtown. \n\nNow, comparing the longitudes.\
      \ The key here is to check the longitude coordinates. Places further west have\
      \ more negative longitudes (if we consider the prime meridian as 0). For example,\
      \ New York is around -74 degrees longitude, and California is around -122 degrees.\
      \ Wait, wait, no. Wait, longitude decreases as you go west from the prime meridian.\
      \ So New York is about 40.7\xB0 N, 74\xB0 W, and San Francisco is around 37.7\xB0\
      \ N, 122.4\xB0 W. Wait, but 122.4\xB0 W would be more west than 74\xB0 W. But\
      \ wait, when comparing longitudes, the smaller (more negative) the longitude,\
      \ the further west it is. So -122.4 is further west than -74. Therefore, 94027\
      \ (California) is west of 10019 (New York). \n\nWait, but let me double-check.\
      \ Maybe I have that reversed. If longitude is measured from the prime meridian\
      \ (0) going east to 180 and west to -180. So a place at 74\xB0 W is 74 degrees\
      \ west of the prime meridian. A place at 122\xB0 W is further west. So yes,\
      \ California is west of New York. Therefore, 94027, CA is west of 10019, NY.\
      \ So the answer should be YES. But wait, maybe the specific locations within\
      \ the state vary. Let me check the exact coordinates of each zip code.\n\nLooking\
      \ up 94027. Atherton, CA has coordinates approximately 37.45\xB0 N, 122.20\xB0\
      \ W. 10019 is in Manhattan, NY, which is around 40.76\xB0 N, 73.97\xB0 W. So\
      \ 94027's longitude is -122.20, and 10019 is -73.97. Since -122.20 is more negative\
      \ (or further west), 94027 is indeed west of 10019. Therefore, the answer is\
      \ YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Identify Locations:**\
      \  \n   - 94027 corresponds to Atherton, CA (approx. longitude -122.20\xB0).\
      \  \n   - 10019 corresponds to New York, NY (approx. longitude -73.97\xB0).\
      \  \n\n2. **Compare Longitudes:**  \n   - A more negative longitude indicates\
      \ a location further west.  \n   - -122.20\xB0 (CA) is more negative than -73.97\xB0\
      \ (NY).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n94027, CA is west of 10019, NY.  \n\n**Answer:**\
      \ YES"
    1619060c-df22-4365-a17e-f445ff95adbd: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the zip code 94027 in California is west of 10019 in New York. Hmm,\
      \ I need to figure out the longitude of both zip codes because west would mean\
      \ a more negative longitude (if we consider the prime meridian as 0). \n\nFirst,\
      \ I need to find the locations of these zip codes. 94027 is in California. I\
      \ know that California is on the west coast of the US, so its longitude should\
      \ be around -120 to -118 or so, maybe. New York is on the east coast, so their\
      \ longitude is around -74 or -73, like New York City. \n\nLet me try to recall\
      \ or think of specific areas. 94027 might be somewhere in the Bay Area. Maybe\
      \ Atherton? Because I've heard that 94027 is Atherton, CA. If that's correct,\
      \ then Atherton is in the San Francisco Bay Area. The longitude for Atherton\
      \ is approximately -122.2. \n\nOn the other hand, 10019 is a New York zip code,\
      \ probably in Manhattan. Midtown Manhattan, maybe? The longitude for NYC is\
      \ around -73.9 to -74.0. So, for example, New York City's longitude is about\
      \ -74.0060. \n\nComparing the two, -122.2 (94027) vs -74.0 (10019). Since longitude\
      \ decreases as you go west, the more negative the longitude, the further west\
      \ it is. So -122 is more west than -74. Therefore, 94027 CA is indeed west of\
      \ 10019 NY. \n\nWait, but I should double-check the actual coordinates to make\
      \ sure I'm not mixing up zip codes. Let me confirm 94027. A quick search in\
      \ my mind: Atherton, CA 94027. Yes, that's correct. And 10019 is definitely\
      \ in NYC, like the Theater District or somewhere around there.\n\nSo, Atherton's\
      \ longitude is roughly -122.2, and NYC's is -74.0. So yes, 94027 is west of\
      \ 10019. The answer should be YES.\n</think>YES. The longitude of 94027 (Atherton,\
      \ CA) is approximately -122.2, which is west of the longitude of 10019 (New\
      \ York, NY) at approximately -74.0. Since lower (more negative) longitude values\
      \ indicate positions further west, 94027, CA is indeed west of 10019, NY. \n\
      \n**Answer:** YES"
    37464c27-eacb-4123-817c-96c568e31188: "<think>Okay, so the question is whether\
      \ the zip code 94027 in California is west of 10019 in New York. Hmm, let me\
      \ think about how to figure this out. \n\nFirst, I know that zip codes in the\
      \ US are assigned geographically, with lower numbers starting in the east and\
      \ increasing as you go west. But wait, is that true? I think the first digit\
      \ represents a group of states. For example, zip codes starting with 0 are in\
      \ the Northeast, like Maine or Vermont, and higher numbers go westward. So California\
      \ zip codes start with 9, which is the highest, so they're on the West Coast.\
      \ New York zip codes start with 1, which is the Northeast. So that would mean\
      \ California is west of New York, which makes sense. But the question is specifically\
      \ about these two zip codes: 94027 and 10019. \n\nBut wait, maybe the longitude\
      \ is a better way to determine this. Zip codes can cover areas, so the exact\
      \ longitude of the center or the area they cover might matter. I need to find\
      \ the approximate longitude of each zip code. \n\nLet me recall major cities.\
      \ 10019 is a New York zip code. I think that's in Manhattan, maybe Midtown area.\
      \ So the longitude for New York City is around 74 degrees West. For 94027, that's\
      \ in California. Let me think where exactly. 94027 is Atherton, California.\
      \ Atherton is in the San Francisco Bay Area. The longitude for that area is\
      \ around 122 degrees West. Wait, but longitude goes from 0 to 180 West and East.\
      \ So the more west you are, the higher the West longitude value. Wait no: longitude\
      \ is measured from the Prime Meridian (0 degrees) in Greenwich, England. Going\
      \ west from there, the degrees increase up to 180. So New York is around 74\
      \ degrees West, and San Francisco is around 122 degrees West. Since 122 is a\
      \ larger number than 74, San Francisco is further west. Therefore, 94027 (Atherton,\
      \ CA) is west of 10019 (New York, NY). \n\nWait, but let me confirm the exact\
      \ longitudes. Maybe Atherton is at approximately 122.2 West, and New York City\
      \ is around 73.9 West. So 122 is definitely west of 74. So the answer is YES.\
      \ \n\nI think that makes sense. The West Coast is much further west than the\
      \ East Coast. So even though both are in the US, California is on the western\
      \ side, New York on the eastern. Therefore, any California location would be\
      \ west of a New York location.\n</think>YES. The longitude of 94027 (Atherton,\
      \ CA) is approximately 122.2\xB0W, while 10019 (New York, NY) is around 73.98\xB0\
      W. Since higher west longitude values indicate positions further west, 94027,\
      \ CA is indeed west of 10019, NY. \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    555e7724-a9dd-4d57-a458-390949ad9d53: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure out whether\
      \ the zip code 94027 in California is west of 10019 in New York. Hmm, I'm not\
      \ super familiar with zip codes and their exact locations, but I know that zip\
      \ codes in the US generally correspond to areas from the east coast to the west\
      \ coast. So California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast.\
      \ But wait, there might be exceptions, so I need to be careful here.\n\nFirst,\
      \ let's confirm the states. 94027 is in CA, which is California, and 10019 is\
      \ in NY, which is New York. So California is definitely west of New York state.\
      \ But maybe the actual longitude of those specific zip codes matters? Because\
      \ even within a state, some areas might be more east or west. For example, parts\
      \ of California might be further east than others, but I think most of California\
      \ is quite far west. New York City, where 10019 is probably located (since it's\
      \ a New York zip code starting with 100, which I think is NYC), is on the east\
      \ coast. \n\nLet me check the approximate longitudes. New York City is around\
      \ 74\xB0 West longitude. San Francisco, which is in the area of 94027 (I think\
      \ that zip code is for Atherton or Menlo Park?), is around 122\xB0 West. Wait,\
      \ no, negative values? Wait, longitude west of the prime meridian is measured\
      \ as negative in some systems, but maybe here they're using degrees west as\
      \ positive. So New York is approximately 74 degrees West longitude, and California\
      \ areas like San Francisco are around 122 degrees West. Wait, actually, higher\
      \ numerical value in west longitude means further west. So 122\xB0W is further\
      \ west than 74\xB0W. Wait, but longitude for the US is all west, so the numbers\
      \ increase as you go west from the prime meridian. So New York is around 74\xB0\
      W, and California is around 120\xB0W. Therefore, 122 is more west than 74. Wait\
      \ no, when you go west from the prime meridian, the longitude increases up to\
      \ 180. So New York is at about 74\xB0W, San Francisco is around 122\xB0W. Since\
      \ 122 is a higher number west, that means it's further west. So 94027 in CA\
      \ (around 122\xB0W) would indeed be west of 10019 in NY (74\xB0W). Therefore,\
      \ the answer should be YES. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the exact\
      \ locations. Let me think: 10019 is a New York City zip code. Manhattan, maybe?\
      \ Like Midtown. So its longitude is approximately 73.9865\xB0W. And 94027 is\
      \ Atherton, CA, which is in the Bay Area, near Stanford. The longitude for Atherton\
      \ is around 122.1997\xB0W. Comparing those two, 122.1997\xB0W is indeed west\
      \ of 73.9865\xB0W. So yes, the California zip code is west of the New York one.\
      \ Even though California is a western state, the actual longitude confirms it.\
      \ Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \nThe zip code 94027 (Atherton,\
      \ CA) is located at approximately **122.2\xB0W** longitude, while 10019 (New\
      \ York, NY) is at **73.98\xB0W**. Since lower longitude values (east) are closer\
      \ to the Prime Meridian (0\xB0), a higher longitude in the western hemisphere\
      \ (e.g., 122.2\xB0W) is farther west. Thus, 94027, CA, is west of 10019, NY.\
      \ \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    5fff235f-4bcc-40a4-b2ef-1a35a302a165: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the zip code 94027 in California is west of 10019 in New York. Alright, let's\
      \ start by recalling some basics about US zip codes and geography. \n\nFirst,\
      \ I know that zip codes in the US are assigned generally from east to west,\
      \ with the lower numbers starting in the northeast and increasing as you move\
      \ west and south. For example, New York zip codes start with 1, while California\
      \ zip codes start with 9. That might already suggest that California is west\
      \ of New York, but wait, zip codes are more about regions than exact longitude.\
      \ So even though 94027 starts with 9, which is a western region, I can't just\
      \ rely on the first digit because zip codes can have a lot of variation within\
      \ a state. \n\nNext step: identify the actual locations of these zip codes.\
      \ 10019 is in New York, probably Manhattan. Let me confirm that. 100xx zip codes\
      \ are generally in New York City, specifically Manhattan. For example, 10019\
      \ is the area around Midtown, maybe the Theater District or near Central Park.\
      \ \n\nNow, 94027 is in California. Let me think. The 940 area code is for the\
      \ San Francisco Bay Area. Specifically, 94027 is Atherton, California. Atherton\
      \ is in San Mateo County, which is in the Silicon Valley area, south of San\
      \ Francisco. \n\nSo now the question is: Is Atherton, CA (94027) west of Midtown\
      \ Manhattan (10019)? To determine this, I need to compare their longitudes.\
      \ The longitude measures how far east or west a location is. Places with a higher\
      \ longitude (more west) have a higher numerical value if we're using the conventional\
      \ -180 to 180 system, but in the US, all longitudes are negative because they\
      \ are west of the prime meridian. Wait, no\u2014actually, in the US, longitude\
      \ is measured west of the prime meridian, so it's represented as negative degrees.\
      \ For example, New York is around -74 degrees longitude, and California is around\
      \ -122 degrees. Wait, but that can't be right because lower numbers (less negative)\
      \ are more east. So New York is around -73.9 (approx) for Manhattan, and San\
      \ Francisco is around -122.4. Wait, but that would mean San Francisco is west\
      \ (since it's more negative), which makes sense. So if Atherton is in the San\
      \ Francisco Bay Area, its longitude would be around -122.3 or so. Manhattan\
      \ is around -73.97. \n\nWait, the more west a location is, the more negative\
      \ (or smaller in value) its longitude is. So if we compare the two, -122 (Atherton)\
      \ is more west than -74 (New York). So Atherton is indeed west of New York City.\
      \ Therefore, 94027, CA is west of 10019, NY. \n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe\
      \ I got the longitude signs wrong. Longitude for New York: Manhattan's coordinates\
      \ are approximately 40.7128\xB0 N, 74.0060\xB0 W. So that's 74.0060\xB0 West.\
      \ For Atherton, California: Coordinates are approximately 37.4544\xB0 N, 122.2001\xB0\
      \ W. Wait, wait, that can't be. Wait, if Atherton is at 122.2001\xB0 W, that's\
      \ more west than 74\xB0 W. Because 122 degrees west is further west than 74\
      \ degrees west. So yes, Atherton is west of New York. Because 122\xB0W is more\
      \ west than 74\xB0W. So in terms of longitude, the higher the number in degrees\
      \ west, the further west it is. So 122\xB0W is further west than 74\xB0W. \n\
      \nTherefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES. \n\nTo determine if 94027\
      \ (Atherton, CA) is west of 10019 (New York, NY), compare their longitudes:\
      \  \n- **10019, NY**: Approximately 74.006\xB0 W.  \n- **94027, CA**: Approximately\
      \ 122.200\xB0 W.  \n\nSince 122.200\xB0 W is farther west than 74.006\xB0 W,\
      \ **94027, CA** is indeed located west of **10019, NY**.  \n\n**Answer:** YES."
    6a218ac5-0258-4d7f-ae3b-d39dc68a86f7: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the zip code 94027 in California is located west of 10019 in New York.\
      \ Hmm. I need to figure out the longitudinal coordinates of both zip codes because\
      \ longitude determines east-west positioning. The one with a higher (more westward)\
      \ longitude would be further west. Wait, no, actually, in the US, longitude\
      \ is measured as west of the prime meridian, so lower numbers (more negative)\
      \ would be further west. Wait, no, longitude in the US is typically in the negative\
      \ range because it's west of the prime meridian. So for example, New York is\
      \ around -74 degrees, and California is around -122 degrees. Wait, but longitude\
      \ for the US is negative when using the standard coordinate system where east\
      \ is positive and west is negative. So a more negative longitude would mean\
      \ further west.\n\nSo first, I need to find the longitude of both zip codes.\
      \ Let me recall that 10019 is a New York zip code, probably in Manhattan. I\
      \ think the longitude for NYC is around -74 degrees. For 94027, which is in\
      \ California, probably in the Bay Area. The longitude for that area is around\
      \ -122 degrees. Wait, -122 is more west than -74, right? Because as you go west,\
      \ the longitude becomes more negative. So California would have a lower (more\
      \ negative) longitude than New York. Therefore, 94027, CA would be west of 10019,\
      \ NY. So the answer should be YES. But let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe I can look up approximate locations. 94027 is Atherton, CA, which is\
      \ in the San Francisco Bay Area. 10019 is in New York City, specifically Midtown\
      \ Manhattan. The US map shows that California is definitely west of New York.\
      \ So regardless of the specific zip codes, California is west of New York. Therefore,\
      \ any zip code in California should be west of any zip code in New York. But\
      \ wait, that's a general assumption. Are there any edge cases where a CA zip\
      \ code might be east of a NY one? Probably not, since the entire state of California\
      \ is west of New York. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>To determine if\
      \ 94027, CA is west of 10019, NY, compare their longitudes:\n- **94027 (Atherton,\

    87e8b358-15c5-42ac-a961-99fbcb53dbcf: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ I need to figure out if the ZIP code 94027 in California is located west of\
      \ 10019 in New York. Okay, first, I know that ZIP codes in the US are organized\
      \ geographically, but I'm not exactly sure how. I think the first digit represents\
      \ a region, right? Like, the northeast starts with 0 or 1, and the west coast\
      \ has higher numbers. Let me confirm that. \n\nSo, ZIP codes starting with 9\
      \ are in the western part of the US, maybe California, Alaska, Hawaii? And New\
      \ York is in the northeast, so their ZIP codes probably start with 1. The given\
      \ ZIP codes are 94027 (CA) and 10019 (NY). That fits because 9 for California\
      \ and 1 for New York.\n\nBut wait, the question isn't just about the ZIP code\
      \ regions; it's about the actual longitude of these specific locations. Even\
      \ though 94027 is a 9xxxx code and 10019 is a 1xxxx, the exact longitude could\
      \ vary. For example, parts of California might be further east than parts of\
      \ New York. But generally, California is on the West Coast, and New York is\
      \ on the East Coast. So, likely, California is west of New York. But I need\
      \ to check the specific longitude of these ZIP codes to be sure.\n\nLet me think:\
      \ 94027 is in California. I think that's Atherton or Menlo Park area. Let me\
      \ recall. Menlo Park is near Palo Alto, part of Silicon Valley. So that's in\
      \ Northern California. And 10019 is in New York City, probably Manhattan. So,\
      \ Manhattan's longitude is around 74 degrees west, and Menlo Park is around\
      \ 122 degrees west. Wait, longitude west increases as you go west, but wait,\
      \ no\u2014longitude is measured from the prime meridian. So, the more west you\
      \ go in the US, the higher the longitude value in the western hemisphere (negative\
      \ numbers if using the east/west format). Wait, actually, in the US, all longitudes\
      \ are west of the prime meridian, so they're expressed as negative degrees,\
      \ like -74 for New York and -122 for California. But when people refer to longitude,\
      \ they might say 74 degrees West and 122 degrees West. \n\nSo, the higher the\
      \ number in the west direction (more west), the greater the longitude value\
      \ (since it's west, it's negative, but in absolute terms, 122 is further west\
      \ than 74). So, California's longitude is more west (more negative) than New\
      \ York's. Therefore, 94027 (CA) would be west of 10019 (NY).\n\nBut let me double-check.\
      \ Let's get the approximate coordinates. For 94027: Atherton, CA. Let me think.\
      \ San Francisco is around 37.7\xB0 N, 122.4\xB0 W. So Atherton would be nearby,\
      \ maybe 122.2\xB0 W. And New York City, 10019 is Midtown Manhattan, which is\
      \ around 40.75\xB0 N, 73.98\xB0 W. So comparing the longitudes: 122.2\xB0 W\
      \ vs. 73.98\xB0 W. Since 122 is further west (higher number in the west direction),\
      \ yes, 94027 is west of 10019. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES. ZIP\
      \ code 94027 (Atherton, CA) is located at approximately 122.2\xB0 W longitude,\
      \ while 10019 (New York, NY) is around 73.98\xB0 W. Since lower longitude values\
      \ (west becomes more negative) indicate positions further west in the Western\
      \ Hemisphere, 94027 is indeed west of 10019. \n\nAnswer: YES"
    dccd11a0-325c-4fbf-bae8-069d46e3859f: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure out whether\
      \ the zip code 94027 in California is west of 10019 in New York. Hmm, zip codes...\
      \ I know they're related to locations in the US, but I'm not exactly sure how\
      \ they map geographically. First, maybe I should recall that US zip codes generally\
      \ increase from east to west? Wait, no, that's not quite right. The first digit\
      \ of the zip code represents a group of states. For example, the Northeast starts\
      \ with 0 or 1, then moving westward, the numbers increase. So maybe East Coast\
      \ zip codes start with lower numbers. Let me think... New York is in the Northeast,\
      \ so its zip codes likely start with 1. California is on the West Coast, so\
      \ their zip codes start with 9. So 94027 would be in California (9xxxx), and\
      \ 10019 in New York (10xxx). \n\nBut the question is about their longitude.\
      \ Even though California is west of New York overall, maybe the specific zip\
      \ codes' locations could vary. So I need to check the actual longitudes of these\
      \ two zip codes. But how? I don't have that memorized. Maybe I can reason based\
      \ on cities. Let's see, 10019 is New York, NY. That's Manhattan, probably around\
      \ Midtown. 94027 is in California. Let me think, what city is that? A quick\
      \ search in my mind... 94027 is Atherton, CA. Atherton is in the Bay Area, near\
      \ Palo Alto and Stanford. So San Francisco area. \n\nNow, comparing the longitudes:\
      \ New York City is around 74 degrees West longitude. San Francisco is about\
      \ 122 degrees West. Wait, no, actually, longitude decreases as you go west.\
      \ Wait, no, longitude is measured from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0) going east\
      \ to 180\xB0 and west to -180\xB0, but in the US, all longitudes are west, so\
      \ they're negative if using the convention where east is positive. Wait, maybe\
      \ this is confusing. Let me clarify. New York City's longitude is approximately\
      \ 74 degrees West (which would be -74 in decimal), and San Francisco is around\
      \ 122 degrees West (-122). Since 122 is more west than 74, San Francisco is\
      \ west of NYC. Therefore, Atherton, CA (94027) being in the Bay Area is west\
      \ of 10019, NY (New York City). \n\nSo the answer should be YES. But wait, just\
      \ to be thorough, maybe check if the specific zip codes are in those cities.\
      \ 10019 is definitely NYC, specifically parts of Midtown Manhattan. 94027 is\
      \ Atherton, CA, which is in the southern part of the San Francisco Bay Area.\
      \ So their longitudes would be approximately as I thought. Therefore, since\
      \ California is west of New York, and these zip codes are in those states, 94027\
      \ is west of 10019.\n</think>YES. 94027 (Atherton, CA) is located west of 10019\
      \ (New York, NY) because California lies on the West Coast, with a longitude\
      \ of approximately 122\xB0W for Atherton, while New York City is around 74\xB0\
      W. Since lower longitude values (more easterly) correspond to locations farther\
      \ east, the higher longitude value of Atherton confirms it is further west.\

    fdd56ec2-36f7-4b50-b8e7-d4dc7be566d4: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the zip code 94027 in California is west of 10019 in New York. Hmm,\
      \ I need to figure out the longitude of both zip codes because west would mean\
      \ a lower longitude (more negative if we're using the standard where west of\
      \ the Prime Meridian is negative). \n\nFirst, I should recall that in the US,\
      \ as you go from the East Coast to the West Coast, the longitude decreases.\
      \ New York is on the East Coast, so its longitude should be around -74 or so,\
      \ while California is on the West Coast, so maybe around -122? But I need to\
      \ check the specific zip codes.\n\nLet me think about 10019, NY. That's a New\
      \ York City zip code. I think Manhattan's zip codes start with 100... so 10019\
      \ is probably somewhere in Midtown or the West Side. The longitude for NYC is\
      \ approximately -74.0060, but maybe the specific zip code's longitude is a bit\
      \ different. \n\nThen 94027 is in California. 940 is the area code for parts\
      \ of the San Francisco Bay Area. 94027 might be Atherton or Menlo Park? Those\
      \ are in the Silicon Valley area. The longitude there is around -122.2 or so.\
      \ \n\nSo if 94027 is around -122.2 and 10019 is around -74.0, then 94027 is\
      \ indeed west of 10019 because -122.2 is more west (more negative) than -74.0.\
      \ Therefore, the answer should be YES. But wait, I should confirm the exact\
      \ longitudes. Maybe I can recall that San Francisco is around -122.4, so Menlo\

      \ So yes, California is definitely west of New York. So the answer is YES.\n\
      </think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Identify Locations:** \
      \ \n   - 94027 corresponds to Atherton, CA (Silicon Valley area).  \n   - 10019\
      \ corresponds to Midtown Manhattan, NY.  \n\n2. **Determine Longitudes:**  \n\

    152e9445-b6ed-4882-8f59-e95c8c71af0a: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The user wants to know if the zip code 70130 in Louisiana (LA)\
      \ is located west of 10013 in New York (NY). Hmm, okay. \n\nFirst, I need to\
      \ recall that zip codes in the US are generally assigned from east to west,\
      \ with lower numbers starting in the northeast and increasing as you move west\
      \ and south. But I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate for all regions. Maybe\
      \ I should verify that. However, even if that's the case, individual zip codes\
      \ can vary, so relying solely on the numerical value might not be precise.\n\
      \nNext, I should think about the actual geographic locations of these two zip\
      \ codes. 70130 is in Louisiana, which is a southern state, but more towards\
      \ the central part of the US. New York, specifically 10013, is in Manhattan,\
      \ which is on the east coast. So, intuitively, Louisiana is south of New York\
      \ but also west? Let me visualize a map: New York City is on the east coast,\
      \ while Louisiana, like New Orleans, is further south but also further west\
      \ compared to NYC. For example, New Orleans is around 90 degrees west longitude,\
      \ and NYC is around 74 degrees west. Since longitude decreases as you move west\
      \ from the prime meridian (which runs through Greenwich, England), a lower longitude\
      \ number is more east, higher is more west. Wait, no\u2014actually, longitude\
      \ west is measured as degrees west of the prime meridian, so a higher number\
      \ means further west. For example, New York is around 74\xB0 W, and New Orleans\
      \ is around 90\xB0 W. Wait, 90 is higher than 74, so New Orleans would be further\
      \ west. So yes, 70130 (LA) is west of 10013 (NY). \n\nBut let me double-check\
      \ to be sure. Maybe look up the specific coordinates. For zip code 10013, that's\
      \ in Manhattan, New York City. The approximate longitude is about -74.0060.\
      \ For 70130, which is New Orleans, LA, the longitude is approximately -90.0715.\
      \ Wait, negative longitude values are west of the prime meridian, so more negative\
      \ means further west. So -90 is more west than -74. So yes, 70130 is west of\
      \ 10013. Therefore, the answer should be YES. \n\nAnother way: if I compare\
      \ the absolute values, 90 is greater than 74, but since they're both west (negative),\
      \ the one with the larger absolute value is further west. So yes, 70130 is west\
      \ of 10013. \n\nTherefore, the answer is YES.</think>YES. To determine if 70130,\
      \ LA is west of 10013, NY, compare their longitudes.  \n- **10013, NY** (Manhattan)\

      \ W**.  \n\nSince **-90.071\xB0 W** is farther west than **-74.006\xB0 W**,\
      \ **70130, LA** is indeed west of **10013, NY**.  \n\nANSWER: YES"
    17d903b6-dcc3-43b4-82b1-aa50ed6e2f3b: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the zip code 70130 in Louisiana (LA) is located west of 10013 in New\
      \ York (NY). I need to figure out the longitude of each zip code because the\
      \ west-east position is determined by longitude. The further west a location\
      \ is, the lower its longitude value (in the US, since longitudes are negative\
      \ there).\n\nFirst, I need to find the approximate longitude for each zip code.\
      \ Let me recall that zip codes in the US are assigned geographically, with lower\
      \ numbers in the east and higher numbers as you move west, but that's more for\
      \ the first digits. For example, zip codes starting with 0 are in the Northeast,\
      \ and 9 on the West Coast. But specific longitude and latitude for a zip code\
      \ can vary, so exact coordinates might be needed.\n\nLet me start with 70130.\
      \ That's a Louisiana zip code. New Orleans zip codes start with 701, so 70130\
      \ is likely in New Orleans. New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana, near the\
      \ Mississippi River. The longitude of New Orleans is approximately 90 degrees\
      \ west. But maybe more precise. Let me check (if I were actually doing this,\
      \ I'd look up the coordinates, but since I can't, I'll go by memory). The French\
      \ Quarter in New Orleans is around 90.07 degrees west longitude.\n\nNow, 10013\
      \ is a New York zip code. Manhattan zip codes include 100xx. Specifically, 10013\
      \ is in the Tribeca area of Lower Manhattan. The longitude of Manhattan is around\
      \ 74 degrees west. For example, New York City's coordinates are roughly 40.7128\xB0\
      \ N, 74.0060\xB0 W. So the longitude is approximately -74.0060.\n\nComparing\
      \ the two longitudes: New Orleans at around 90\xB0W and New York at 74\xB0W.\
      \ Wait, but wait\u2014if a place is further west, its longitude is a larger\
      \ negative number (or a higher numerical value west). For example, 90\xB0W is\
      \ further west than 74\xB0W. So since 90 is west of 74, that would mean New\
      \ Orleans is west of New York. So yes, 70130, LA is west of 10013, NY.\n\nBut\
      \ wait, let me confirm: the lower the longitude (more negative), the further\
      \ west. Wait no, longitude goes from 0\xB0 (prime meridian) to 180\xB0 east\
      \ and west. So west longitude is measured as degrees west from the prime meridian.\
      \ So 74\xB0W is 74 degrees west, and 90\xB0W is 90 degrees west. So 90\xB0W\
      \ is further west than 74\xB0W. So yes, New Orleans is west of New York City.\
      \ Therefore, 70130 (New Orleans) is west of 10013 (NYC).\n\nSo the answer is\
      \ YES.\n</think>YES  \nThe longitude of New Orleans, LA (zip 70130) is approximately\
      \ 90\xB0W, while New York, NY (zip 10013) is around 74\xB0W. Since 90\xB0W is\
      \ farther west than 74\xB0W, 70130 is located west of 10013."

      \ the zip code 70130 in Louisiana is west of 10013 in New York. Let me try to\
      \ figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that zip codes in the US are\
      \ numbered starting from the east coast and go west. So the lower numbers are\
      \ in the northeast, like New York, and higher numbers as you move west. But\
      \ I'm not entirely sure how specific that is. For example, New York's zip codes\
      \ start with 10-11, right? Like 100xx for Manhattan. Louisiana is in the south,\
      \ so maybe their zip codes start with 70 or 71? Wait, 70130 does start with\
      \ 70, which would be in the southern region. But how does that translate to\
      \ longitude?\n\nI think the first three digits of the zip code represent a sectional\
      \ center facility, and those are generally assigned from east to west. So lower\
      \ numbers are further east. New York's main zip codes start with 10, which is\
      \ definitely on the east coast. Louisiana's starting with 70, which is higher\
      \ than 10, so maybe it's further west. But wait, some southern states might\
      \ be more east or west. Like, Louisiana is south of, say, Tennessee, but is\
      \ it west of New York? Obviously, geographically, Louisiana is west of New York.\
      \ New York City is on the east coast, while Louisiana is along the Gulf Coast,\
      \ which is to the southwest. So longitude-wise, Louisiana should be west of\
      \ New York. But maybe the specific zip codes might have exceptions?\n\nBut zip\
      \ code 70130 is in New Orleans, right? New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana,\
      \ but compared to New York City, which is on the eastern edge of the US. So\
      \ New Orleans' longitude would be around 90 degrees west, while New York City\
      \ is around 74 degrees west. Wait, no, longitude increases as you go west, so\
      \ 74\xB0W is east of 90\xB0W. So 90\xB0W is further west. Therefore, New Orleans\
      \ is west of New York City. So 70130 (New Orleans, LA) should be west of 10013\
      \ (New York, NY). \n\nSo the answer would be YES. But let me double-check the\
      \ longitudes. Looking up approximate coordinates: New York City is around 40.7128\xB0\
      \ N, 74.0060\xB0 W. New Orleans is approximately 29.9511\xB0 N, 90.0715\xB0\
      \ W. Comparing the longitudes, 74\xB0W vs 90\xB0W. Since 90 is a higher number\
      \ west, New Orleans is indeed west of New York City. Therefore, the zip code\
      \ 70130 is west of 10013.\n</think>YES  \nThe longitude of New Orleans, LA (zip\
      \ 70130) is approximately 90.0715\xB0 W, while New York City, NY (zip 10013)\
      \ is around 74.0060\xB0 W. Since lower longitude values (closer to 0\xB0) are\

      \ 70130. I know Louisiana's main city is New Orleans. Maybe 70130 is there.\
      \ Let me recall: zip codes starting with 70-72 are generally in Louisiana. So\
      \ 70130 is likely New Orleans. Let me confirm that. A quick check (if I had\

      \ represent. ZIP codes are postal codes used by the USPS. The first digit represents\
      \ a group of states. For example, ZIP codes starting with 9 are generally in\
      \ the western part of the US, like California, Washington, etc. On the other\
      \ hand, ZIP codes starting with 1 are in the northeastern area, like New York\

      \ starts with 1, which is New York. Now, the main question is about their longitudinal\
      \ positions. California is definitely west of New York because the US spans\
      \ from the east coast (where New York is) to the west coast (California). So\
      \ without even checking the exact coordinates, the general geography tells me\

      \ like Manhattan being 100xx. So 10007 is likely in New York City, maybe Lower\
      \ Manhattan.\n\nNow, to determine if one is west of the other, I need their\
      \ longitudes. San Francisco is on the West Coast, so its longitude is around\
      \ -122 degrees. New York City is on the East Coast, around -74 degrees. Since\

      \ gives a region\u2014like 9 for the West Coast and 0 or 1 for the East Coast.\
      \ So 94133 starts with 9, which might be California, and 10007 starts with 1,\
      \ which I think is the Northeast, like New York. That's a clue, but I need more\
      \ precise locations.\n\n94133: I remember that San Francisco's zip codes start\
      \ with 94. So 94133 is probably in San Francisco, CA. And 10007 is in New York\
      \ City. Manhattan zip codes often start with 100, so 10007 should be somewhere\
      \ in NYC, maybe lower Manhattan.\n\nNow, comparing their longitudes. San Francisco\
      \ is on the West Coast, and New York is on the East Coast. Generally, the West\
      \ Coast is west of the East Coast. But wait, when you think about the Earth\
      \ being a sphere, technically, moving west from New York might eventually reach\
      \ California, but in terms of direct westward direction, California is west\
      \ of New York. \n\nBut maybe I should check the actual longitudes. San Francisco's\
      \ longitude is approximately 122 degrees west. New York City's longitude is\
      \ around 74 degrees west. Since longitude increases as you go west (from the\
      \ prime meridian), a higher west longitude means further west. So 122\xB0W is\
      \ more west than 74\xB0W. Therefore, San Francisco (94133) is indeed west of\
      \ New York City (10007). \n\nBut wait, longitude is measured from 0\xB0 at Greenwich,\
      \ increasing westward up to 180\xB0. So higher numerical value in west longitude\
      \ means further west. So yes, 122 is more west than 74. So San Francisco is\
      \ west of New York. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \nThe\
      \ zip code 94133 (San Francisco, CA) is located west of 10007 (New York, NY).\
      \ San Francisco's longitude (~122\xB0W) is farther west than New York City's\
      \ (~74\xB0W), confirming that 94133 is west of 10007."
    6a3f8a02-1afc-4892-983c-ac14aa573a85: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The user wants to know if the zip code 94133 in California is\
      \ located west of 10007 in New York. \n\nFirst, I need to recall that zip codes\
      \ in the US are generally assigned from east to west, with the lower numbers\
      \ starting in the Northeast and increasing as you move westward. For example,\
      \ New York zip codes start with 1, while California zip codes start with 9.\
      \ That already suggests that California is west of New York, so 94133 (CA) should\
      \ be west of 10007 (NY). But maybe I should verify this with more precise information.\n\
      \nWait, zip codes do follow a general geographical order, but individual zip\
      \ codes can vary. So maybe the specific longitude coordinates matter here. To\
      \ be accurate, I should look up the actual longitude of each zip code. \n\n\
      The zip code 10007 is in New York City, specifically the area around Wall Street\
      \ in Lower Manhattan. Its approximate coordinates are around 40.7128\xB0 N latitude\
      \ and -74.0060\xB0 W longitude. \n\nZip code 94133 is in San Francisco, California.\
      \ That's the area around Fisherman's Wharf. The coordinates for San Francisco\
      \ are approximately 37.7749\xB0 N latitude and -122.4194\xB0 W longitude. \n\
      \nNow, comparing the longitudes: New York's 10007 is at approximately -74.0060\xB0\
      \ W, and San Francisco's 94133 is at -122.4194\xB0 W. Longitude values become\
      \ more negative as you move west from the Prime Meridian. Therefore, -122.4194\
      \ is further west than -74.0060. \n\nSo, yes, 94133, CA is indeed west of 10007,\
      \ NY. The answer should be YES. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up east\
      \ and west. Since the Prime Meridian is 0\xB0, moving west from there increases\
      \ the negative value in the western hemisphere. So a longitude of -122 is west\
      \ of -74 because it's a larger negative number. Therefore, San Francisco is\
      \ west of New York City. \n\nAnother way to think about it: New York is on the\
      \ East Coast, and California is on the West Coast. So geographically, California\
      \ is west of New York. Therefore, any zip code in California would be west of\
      \ any zip code in New York. Even though zip codes starting with 1 are in the\
      \ Northeast and 9 in the West, confirming the general trend. \n\nSo, putting\
      \ it all together, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \nThe zip code 94133 in\
      \ San Francisco, CA (longitude ~-122.42\xB0 W) is located west of 10007 in New\
      \ York, NY (longitude ~-74.01\xB0 W). Since longitude values decrease westward\
      \ in the Western Hemisphere, the larger negative value (-122.42) places it further\
      \ west."

      \ the zip code 94133 in California is west of 10007 in New York. Let's start\
      \ by recalling that zip codes in the US are assigned based on geographic regions,\
      \ generally with lower numbers in the east and higher as you go west. But I\
      \ think that's more about the numbering system rather than exact longitude.\n\
      \nFirst, I should probably identify the actual locations of these zip codes.\
      \ 94133 is in California, which is on the West Coast, and 10007 is in New York,\
      \ which is on the East Coast. But since the US spans a lot of longitude, California\

      \ a state. For example, some parts of a state might be more east or west than\

      \ So, the user is asking if the ZIP code 94133 in California is located west\

      \ ZIP codes and see which one is further west. Since west longitude is measured\
      \ as negative numbers in the US, the more negative (or smaller) the longitude,\
      \ the further west it is.\n\nFirst, I should recall that ZIP codes in the US\
      \ are assigned geographically. Generally, the eastern states have lower ZIP\
      \ codes, and western ones higher, but that's not necessarily directly tied to\
      \ longitude. For example, New York ZIP codes start with '1', while California\
      \ starts with '9', which might indicate their relative positions, but the exact\
      \ longitude is needed.\n\nI need to find the approximate longitude of each ZIP\

      \ Since -122.4 is more negative than -74.0, that means San Francisco is indeed\
      \ west of New York. Therefore, 94133, CA is west of 10007, NY.\n\nWait, let\

      \ numbers like 0 or 1, while the West Coast has higher numbers like 9. California's\

      \ longitude of these specific ZIP codes to be sure.\n\nFirst, I should find\
      \ the approximate locations of both ZIP codes. 94133 is in California, probably\
      \ San Francisco since that's a well-known area code. 10007 is in New York, likely\

      \ so San Francisco should be west of New York. But maybe there's a twist here?\
      \ Like certain parts of New York that are further west, but Manhattan is pretty\
      \ far east. \n\nWait, but longitude is the key here. The further west a location\
      \ is, the higher its longitude value (in the Western Hemisphere, longitude is\
      \ measured in degrees west from the prime meridian, so it's negative numbers\
      \ when using decimal degrees). Wait, no. Actually, in standard terms, longitude\
      \ for the US is negative because it's west of the prime meridian. So, for example,\
      \ New York City has a longitude around -74 degrees, while San Francisco is around\
      \ -122 degrees. Wait, no\u2014wait, longitude decreases as you go west. So if\
      \ New York is at -74, and San Francisco is at -122, that means San Francisco\

      Wait, let me confirm. New York City's longitude is approximately 74 degrees\

      \ So, the user wants to know if the zip code 90291 in California is west of\
      \ 11201 in New York. Alright, first, I need to figure out the approximate longitude\
      \ of both zip codes because west or east is determined by longitude. The further\
      \ west the longitude (which is a higher negative number or a smaller positive\
      \ number if in the western hemisphere), the more west the location is.\n\nStarting\
      \ with 90291, CA. I know that California is on the west coast of the US, so\
      \ its longitude should be around -118 to -122 or something like that. For example,\
      \ Los Angeles is roughly around -118. So maybe 90291 is somewhere in LA area?\
      \ Let me recall. Wait, 90210 is Beverly Hills, which is in LA, so 90291 might\
      \ be a nearby zip code. Let me confirm. Hmm, actually, looking it up mentally\
      \ (since I can't access the internet), I think 90291 is in Los Angeles County,\
      \ maybe Santa Monica or Venice Beach area? Those areas are coastal, so their\
      \ longitude would be more to the west, perhaps around -118.4 or something.\n\
      \nThen 11201, NY. That's in New York City. Specifically, 11201 is Brooklyn,\
      \ right? So the longitude for NYC is around -74.0. For example, Manhattan is\
      \ around -74.0060, so Brooklyn would be similar. So if CA is around -118 and\
      \ NY is around -74, then California is definitely west of New York because -118\
      \ is more west (since in the US, longitude decreases as you go east). Wait,\
      \ no: longitude is measured from the prime meridian (0\xB0), so as you go west\
      \ from the prime meridian, longitude becomes negative (in the western hemisphere).\
      \ So a longitude of -74 is 74 degrees west, and -118 is 118 degrees west. So\
      \ the higher the negative number, the further west. So yes, -118 is west of\
      \ -74.\n\nTherefore, 90291, CA (around -118 longitude) is west of 11201, NY\
      \ (around -74 longitude). So the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \nZip codes 90291\
      \ (CA) and 11201 (NY) correspond to approximate longitudes of -118.4 (west coast)\
      \ and -74.0 (east coast), respectively. Since lower longitude values (more negative\
      \ in the western hemisphere) indicate locations further west, California's 90291\
      \ is indeed west of New York's 11201.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    38f86e3a-6e25-4bb5-aff7-d4245bb0306b: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the ZIP code 90291 in California is west of 11201 in New York. Let's break\
      \ this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that ZIP codes in the US are organized\
      \ by regions. The first digit generally represents a group of states. For example,\
      \ ZIP codes starting with 0 are in the Northeast, like Massachusetts or Maine,\
      \ while those starting with 9 are on the West Coast, such as California or Washington.\
      \ But wait, 90291 starts with a 9, which I think does correspond to the West\
      \ Coast, so that's California. The New York ZIP code, 11201, starts with 1,\
      \ which I believe is for the Northeast, so that makes sense for New York.\n\n\
      But just knowing the first digit isn't enough. I need to get the actual longitude\
      \ coordinates for both ZIP codes to compare their positions. Longitude measures\
      \ how far east or west a location is. The higher the longitude (in the Western\
      \ Hemisphere), the further west it is. Wait, no, longitude in the US is measured\
      \ west from the prime meridian. So places in the US have negative longitude\
      \ values because they're west of the prime meridian. So, for example, California\
      \ would have a more negative longitude (like -118) compared to New York, which\
      \ might be around -74. Since the more negative the longitude, the further west\
      \ it is. So if 90291 has a more negative longitude than 11201, then it's further\
      \ west.\n\nNow, I need to find the approximate longitudes of these ZIP codes.\
      \ Let me recall or think of major cities. 90291 is in California. Let's see,\
      \ ZIP codes in the 90000 range are typically in Southern California. For example,\
      \ Los Angeles area has 90001 and up. 90210 is Beverly Hills, so 90291 might\
      \ be nearby. Los Angeles is around 118 degrees west longitude. \n\nOn the other\
      \ hand, 11201 is in New York. That's probably Brooklyn, New York City. New York\
      \ City's longitude is around 74 degrees west. So LA is at approximately -118\xB0\
      , and NYC is around -73.9\xB0. Comparing the two, -118 is more negative than\
      \ -74, which means LA is further west. Therefore, 90291 (CA) would indeed be\
      \ west of 11201 (NY). \n\nWait, but I should confirm that 90291 is actually\
      \ in the Los Angeles area. Let me think. ZIP codes starting with 902... So 90210\
      \ is Beverly Hills, 90211 might be adjacent. 90291 could be another nearby area.\
      \ Maybe Culver City or another part of LA County. If that's the case, then the\
      \ longitude would be around -118.4\xB0, which is definitely west of New York's\
      \ -73.9\xB0. \n\nSo putting it all together: since the longitude of 90291, CA\
      \ is more west (more negative) than 11201, NY, the answer is YES. 90291 is located\
      \ west of 11201.\n</think>YES  \nThe ZIP code 90291 in California has a longitude\
      \ around -118.4\xB0, while 11201 in New York is near -73.9\xB0. Since lower\
      \ (more negative) longitude values indicate locations further west, 90291, CA\
      \ is indeed west of 11201, NY."
    3ff089b2-554e-44d7-abb5-6650d4c0bdfa: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the zip code 90291 in California is west of 11201 in New York. Let's start\
      \ by recalling that zip codes in the US are generally assigned from east to\
      \ west, with lower numbers starting in the northeast and increasing as you move\
      \ west and south. But I'm not sure how precise that is for determining longitude.\
      \ Maybe I should look up the actual coordinates of these two zip codes.\n\n\
      First, 90291 is in California. I know that California is on the west coast,\
      \ so its longitude should be more west (a higher negative number if we're using\
      \ the standard where west of the Prime Meridian is negative). New York is on\
      \ the east coast, so 11201, being in New York, would have a longitude that's\
      \ a lower negative number, or maybe even positive if it's east of the Prime\
      \ Meridian? Wait, no, the Prime Meridian is in Greenwich, England, so the entire\
      \ US is west of that, meaning all US longitudes are negative. So, more west\
      \ would mean more negative. For example, Los Angeles is around -118.25, and\
      \ New York City is around -74. So, LA is definitely west of NYC.\n\nBut wait,\
      \ zip codes can vary within a state. 90291 might be in a specific part of California.\
      \ Let me confirm where exactly 90291 is. I think 90291 is Santa Monica, CA.\
      \ Let me check that... Yes, Santa Monica's zip codes include 90401-90405, but\
      \ wait, maybe 90291 is a different area. Alternatively, maybe Beverly Hills?\
      \ Hmm, maybe I should look it up. Alternatively, use a zip code lookup tool.\
      \ But since I can't do that right now, I'll try to remember. Alternatively,\
      \ maybe 90210 is Beverly Hills, and 90291 is nearby. Maybe Santa Monica or another\
      \ coastal city. Either way, it's in Southern California, which is definitely\
      \ west.\n\nOn the other hand, 11201 is in New York. Let me recall that 11201\
      \ is in Brooklyn, New York City. So Brooklyn's longitude is around -73.99, which\
      \ is approximately -74. So, comparing that to Santa Monica, CA, which is approximately\
      \ -118.4. Since -118.4 is more west (more negative) than -74, then yes, 90291\
      \ (CA) is west of 11201 (NY).\n\nWait, but to be thorough, maybe check the exact\
      \ longitudes. If 90291 is in Santa Monica, its longitude is about -118.4912,\
      \ and 11201 in Brooklyn is about -73.9935. So -118.4912 is indeed west of -73.9935\
      \ because it's a larger negative number. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n\
      </think>YES  \nThe longitude of 90291 (Santa Monica, CA) is approximately -118.49,\
      \ while 11201 (Brooklyn, NY) is around -73.99. Since lower (more negative) longitudes\
      \ are farther west, 90291 is west of 11201. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    5e9206dc-ad62-444f-81ed-db21472cead7: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the zip code 90291 in California is west of 11201 in New York. Let's break\
      \ this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that zip codes in the US correspond\
      \ to specific regions, and the first digit generally represents a group of states.\
      \ For example, zip codes starting with 9 are on the West Coast, like California,\
      \ while those starting with 1 are in the Northeast, like New York. But the exact\
      \ longitude might vary even within a state.\n\nI should probably find the approximate\
      \ longitudes of both zip codes. Longitude measures how far east or west a location\
      \ is. Since the question is about which is further west, the one with the lower\
      \ (more negative) longitude would be west of the other.\n\nStarting with 90291,\
      \ CA. I recall that 90210 is Beverly Hills, but 90291 might be nearby. Let me\
      \ check. Maybe it's a specific area in California. Let me confirm the location.\
      \ A quick search tells me that 90291 is indeed in Malibu, California. Malibu\
      \ is along the coast, so its longitude should be around 118.7 degrees West.\n\
      \nNow for 11201, NY. 11201 is in Brooklyn, New York. New York City's longitude\
      \ is roughly 74 degrees West. So Brooklyn would be around that area. Let me\
      \ verify. Yes, Brooklyn, NY 11201 has a longitude of approximately 73.99 degrees\
      \ West.\n\nComparing the two longitudes: Malibu, CA is at about 118.7\xB0W and\
      \ Brooklyn, NY is around 74\xB0W. Since longitude increases as you go west,\
      \ but in negative terms when measured west of the prime meridian. Wait, actually,\
      \ in the US, all longitudes are west, so they're negative numbers. So -118.7\
      \ vs -74. The more negative the longitude, the further west. So -118.7 is west\
      \ of -74. Therefore, Malibu (90291) is indeed west of Brooklyn (11201). \n\n\
      So the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \nThe zip code 90291 (Malibu, CA)\
      \ is located at approximately 118.7\xB0W longitude, while 11201 (Brooklyn, NY)\
      \ is around 74.0\xB0W. Since lower (more negative) longitude values indicate\
      \ locations further west, 90291, CA is indeed west of 11201, NY. \n\nANSWER:\
      \ YES"
    62b293b4-8a6e-4b4e-999e-1b500e624473: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure this out.\
      \ The question is whether the zip code 90291 in California is west of 11201\
      \ in New York. Hmm, I need to compare their longitudes because west means a\
      \ lower longitude (more negative if we're using the standard where west is negative\
      \ in the US).\n\nFirst, I need to find the longitude for each zip code. Let\
      \ me start with 90291, CA. I recall that zip codes in the 90000 range are in\
      \ Southern California. Specifically, 90291 might be in the Beverly Hills or\
      \ Santa Monica area. Santa Monica is right on the coast, so its longitude should\
      \ be around -118.4 or something like that. Let me check that... Yeah, Santa\
      \ Monica's longitude is approximately -118.48.\n\nNext, 11201 is in New York.\
      \ That's Brooklyn, right? New York City's longitude is around -74.0. Brooklyn's\
      \ longitude might be slightly different, but probably still around -73.9 to\
      \ -74.0. Let me confirm. Looking up 11201, it's in Brooklyn, NY. The coordinates\
      \ are roughly latitude 40.6943, longitude -73.9931.\n\nSo comparing the two\
      \ longitudes: 90291 (CA) is at approximately -118.48, and 11201 (NY) is at -73.9931.\
      \ Since longitude decreases as you go west, the more negative the value, the\
      \ further west it is. -118.48 is more negative than -73.99, so 90291 is indeed\
      \ west of 11201.\n</think>YES  \nBecause the longitude of 90291 (CA) is approximately\
      \ -118.48, which is farther west than the longitude of 11201 (NY) at approximately\
      \ -73.99. Lower (more negative) longitudes indicate locations further west."
    a437d1c3-53d6-47db-af02-34c974261e20: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the zip code 90291 in California is west of 11201 in New York. Hmm,\
      \ I need to figure out the approximate longitudes of both places because west\
      \ and east are determined by longitude. The further west a location is, the\
      \ more negative its longitude (in the Americas) or the lower the longitude value\
      \ if we're considering degrees west of the prime meridian.\n\nFirst, I should\
      \ recall where these zip codes are. 90291 is in California. I think 90210 is\
      \ Beverly Hills, so maybe 90291 is somewhere in the Los Angeles area. As for\
      \ 11201, that's a New York zip code. I believe 11201 is in Brooklyn, New York\
      \ City. \n\nNow, I need to find the longitude of both places. Let me think.\
      \ Los Angeles is on the west coast, so its longitude is around -118 degrees.\
      \ New York City is on the east coast, around -74 degrees. Since longitude decreases\
      \ as you go west, a more negative number means further west. So, -118 is more\
      \ west than -74. Therefore, Los Angeles is west of New York City. \n\nBut wait,\
      \ the specific zip codes might be slightly different. Let me check if 90291\
      \ is indeed in the LA area. A quick search in my mind: 90291 is Venice, CA,\
      \ which is part of Los Angeles. So that's correct. And 11201 is definitely Brooklyn,\
      \ NY. \n\nSo, comparing the longitudes: Venice, CA is approximately -118.45,\
      \ and Brooklyn, NY is around -73.99. Since -118.45 is west of -73.99, the answer\
      \ should be yes. But wait, wait. Wait, longitude lines go from 0 at the prime\
      \ meridian to -180 west and +180 east. So, the lower the longitude value (more\
      \ negative), the further west. So yes, -118 is west of -74. Therefore, 90291,\
      \ CA is west of 11201, NY.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n\
      1. **Identify Locations:**  \n   - 90291 corresponds to Venice, California (Los\

    b295e456-97b1-40e1-a187-4413c88f3693: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the zip code 90291 in California is west of 11201 in New York. Let me start\
      \ by recalling that zip codes in the US correspond to geographic areas. The\
      \ first digit of the zip code generally indicates a region, with lower numbers\
      \ starting in the east and increasing as you move west. But wait, 90291 starts\
      \ with a 9, which would be for the western states like California, Alaska, and\
      \ Hawaii. On the other hand, 11201 starts with 1, which is for the Northeast,\
      \ including New York. So that part makes sense.\n\nBut just knowing the first\
      \ digit isn't enough, right? Because even within a state, zip codes can vary.\
      \ So maybe I need to determine the actual longitude of each zip code to see\
      \ which is further west. Since longitude increases from east to west (or is\
      \ it the other way around?), wait no, longitude lines run north to south, with\
      \ values increasing as you go east. So a higher longitude value would be further\
      \ east, and lower would be west. For example, California is on the west coast,\
      \ so its longitude would be around -120 to -118 degrees, while New York is around\
      \ -73 to -74 degrees. Wait, longitude for New York is more negative? Wait, no.\
      \ Let me think. The prime meridian is 0 degrees, and longitude west of that\
      \ is negative in the Western Hemisphere. So New York is around 74 degrees West,\
      \ which would be -74. California is around 118 degrees West (-118). So California\
      \ is further west because -118 is more west than -74? Wait, no. Wait, in terms\
      \ of actual positions, the more west you go, the higher the west longitude.\
      \ Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check: if you have two points, A at -74\
      \ (New York) and B at -118 (California), which is further west? Since longitude\
      \ is measured from 0 at Greenwich, moving west, the longitude becomes negative\
      \ up to -180. So -118 is further west than -74 because -118 is a larger negative\
      \ number. Wait, but if you think in terms of absolute direction, a place at\
      \ 118\xB0 West is further west than one at 74\xB0 West. Yes. So California's\
      \ longitude is more westward than New York's. Therefore, 90291 (CA) would be\
      \ west of 11201 (NY). \n\nBut wait, I should confirm the actual longitudes of\

      \ break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the approximate longitude\
      \ of each zip code because longitude determines how east or west a location\
      \ is. The higher the longitude (in the western hemisphere), the further west\
      \ it is. Wait, no\u2014actually, in the US, which is in the western hemisphere,\
      \ the longitude is measured west from the Prime Meridian. So a higher longitude\
      \ value (more west) means a location is further west. For example, California\
      \ is on the west coast, so it should have a higher longitude (like around 120\xB0\
      W), while New York is on the east coast, maybe around 74\xB0W. Wait, wait\u2014\
      no, that's not right. Wait, longitude for New York is actually around 74 degrees\
      \ West, and California is around 118 degrees West. Wait, no, actually, the longitude\
      \ for Los Angeles is approximately 118.25\xB0W, and New York City is around\
      \ 74.01\xB0W. So California is further west because 118.25\xB0W is a larger\
      \ number west than 74.01\xB0W. So a place in California would have a more westerly\
      \ longitude than one in New York, so it's west of New York.\n\nBut maybe the\
      \ zip codes in question are in different parts of those states. Let me check\
      \ the specific zip codes. \n\nZip code 90291 is in California. Let me recall,\
      \ 90210 is Beverly Hills, but 90291 might be nearby. Maybe Santa Monica or another\
      \ part of LA. Let me confirm. A quick search (if I were to look) would show\

      \ is in Brooklyn, NY. The longitude for Brooklyn is about 73.99\xB0W. \n\nComparing\
      \ the two longitudes: Santa Monica (118.49\xB0W) vs Brooklyn (73.99\xB0W). Since\
      \ 118.49 is west of 73.99 (because higher longitude in the west means further\

      \   - Santa Monica, CA: ~118.49\xB0W.  \n   - Brooklyn, NY: ~73.99\xB0W.  \n\
      \n3. **Conclusion:**  \n   A higher longitude (more west) means a location is\
      \ further west. Since 118.49\xB0W > 73.99\xB0W, Santa Monica (90291) is west\

    ec231baf-53d4-4971-98b7-4ad4d825e00e: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the zip code 90291 in California is west of 11201 in New York. Hmm,\
      \ I need to figure out the approximate longitudes of both places because west\
      \ or east is determined by longitude. The further west a location is, the lower\
      \ (more negative) its longitude, since the US is in the western hemisphere.\n\
      \nFirst, I should recall or find out the longitude for each zip code. Let's\
      \ start with 90291, CA. I know that California is on the west coast, so its\
      \ longitude should be around 118\xB0 West or so. But maybe more precise. Zip\
      \ code 90291 is in Santa Monica, California. Let me confirm that. Yes, Santa\
      \ Monica's zip codes include 90401-90405, but maybe 90291 is a different area.\
      \ Wait, maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, maybe 90291 is in another\
      \ part of LA. Wait, perhaps I can think of Beverly Hills? No, Beverly Hills\
      \ is 90210. Maybe 90291 is in the vicinity. Alternatively, maybe it's in Malibu?\
      \ Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can use a general approach. Since California\
      \ is in the Pacific Time Zone, which is UTC-8, while New York is in Eastern\
      \ Time (UTC-5). The time zones can give a rough idea, but longitude is more\
      \ precise.\n\nAlternatively, I can look up the coordinates. But since I can't\
      \ actually look it up right now, I'll have to rely on general knowledge. Let's\
      \ approximate. Los Angeles is around 118\xB0W longitude. New York City is around\
      \ 74\xB0W. So, since 118 is more west (more negative) than 74, Los Angeles is\
      \ west of New York. Therefore, if 90291 is in the Los Angeles area, which it\
      \ likely is (since it's a CA zip code starting with 90, which I think is Southern\
      \ California), then it's west of New York's 11201, which is in Brooklyn, NY.\
      \ So 11201 is in New York City, which is around 74\xB0W. So 90291 (CA) at ~118\xB0\

      \ varies. Los Angeles is around 118\xB0 W. If 90291 is in LA, then it's definitely\
      \ west of 11201. Wait, but maybe 90291 is somewhere else? Let me check. ZIP\
      \ code 90291 is for Venice, California, which is part of Los Angeles. So Venice,\
      \ CA's longitude is approximately 118.45\xB0 W. \n\nSo 11201 in Brooklyn is\
      \ roughly 74\xB0 W, and 90291 is around 118\xB0 W. Since longitude lines go\
      \ from 0\xB0 (Greenwich) to 180\xB0 west or east. In the US, all longitudes\
      \ are west, so they are negative if using the -180 to +180 system. But in terms\
      \ of numerical values, 118\xB0 W is more west than 74\xB0 W. So since 118 is\
      \ a larger number (when considering west as negative, 118\xB0 W is -118, and\
      \ 74\xB0 W is -74. So -118 is further west than -74). Therefore, 90291, CA is\
      \ indeed west of 11201, NY. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me\
      \ confirm: when comparing longitudes, the more westward a location is, the smaller\
      \ the longitude becomes in the eastern hemisphere, but when moving west from\
      \ the prime meridian, the longitude becomes more negative. So, for example,\
      \ 118\xB0 W is equivalent to -118\xB0, and 74\xB0 W is -74\xB0. Since -118 is\
      \ less than -74, that means 118\xB0 W is indeed further west. So yes, Venice,\
      \ CA is west of Brooklyn, NY. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES\
      \  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Determine Locations**:  \n   - ZIP\
      \ code 90291 corresponds to Venice, California (approx. longitude -118.45\xB0\
      ).  \n   - ZIP code 11201 corresponds to Brooklyn, New York (approx. longitude\
      \ -73.99\xB0).  \n\n2. **Compare Longitudes**:  \n   - A more negative longitude\
      \ indicates a location further west.  \n   - -118.45\xB0 (Venice, CA) is more\
      \ negative than -73.99\xB0 (Brooklyn, NY).  \n\n**Conclusion**: Venice, CA (90291)\
      \ is west of Brooklyn, NY (11201).  \n**Answer**: YES"

    4083f242-3b8e-4eef-a1d0-3f60009c3b43: "<think>Okay, I need to figure out if the\
      \ zip code 94301 in California is west of the zip code 10023 in New York. Hmm,\
      \ let's start by recalling what I know about zip codes. \n\nFirst, I remember\
      \ that zip codes in the US are organized geographically, with the first digit\
      \ representing a region. For example, zip codes starting with 0 are in the Northeast,\
      \ like New England, and the numbers increase as you move west. So California\
      \ zip codes start with 9, which makes sense since they're on the West Coast.\
      \ New York zip codes start with 1, which aligns with the Northeast.\n\nBut just\
      \ knowing the regions might not be enough because even within the same state,\
      \ zip codes can vary. So I need to get the exact longitude of each zip code\
      \ to compare their positions. Longitude measures how far east or west a location\
      \ is. The higher the longitude (in degrees west), the further west it is, but\
      \ wait, no\u2014longitude is measured from the prime meridian (0\xB0), with\
      \ positive values going east up to 180\xB0 and negative going west. Wait, actually,\
      \ in the US, which is west of the prime meridian, longitudes are typically given\
      \ as negative numbers. For example, New York is around -74\xB0 and California\
      \ around -122\xB0. So the more negative the longitude, the further west it is.\
      \ Wait, no, actually, longitude values in the western hemisphere are negative,\
      \ so a lower longitude (more negative) is further west. So if 94301 has a longitude\
      \ of, say, -122\xB0, and 10023 has around -74\xB0, then 94301 would be west\
      \ because -122 is less (more west) than -74.\n\nSo I need to find the longitudes\
      \ for both zip codes. Let me think about how to get that. Maybe I remember that\
      \ Palo Alto, CA has a zip code starting with 94301. Palo Alto is in Silicon\
      \ Valley, so that's definitely in Northern California, near San Francisco. New\
      \ York's 10023 is probably Manhattan, maybe the Upper West Side. So comparing\
      \ the longitudes of Palo Alto and Manhattan.\n\nLooking up approximate longitudes:\
      \ San Francisco is around -122.4\xB0, and New York City is around -74.0\xB0\
      . So Palo Alto would be similar to San Francisco's longitude, maybe around -122.1\xB0\
      \ to -122.2\xB0. Manhattan, being in NYC, is at about -74.0\xB0. So since -122\
      \ is more west (more negative) than -74, that would mean 94301 is west of 10023.\
      \ Therefore, the answer would be YES.\n</think>YES  \nThe zip code 94301 (Palo\
      \ Alto, CA) has a longitude around -122.1\xB0, while 10023 (New York, NY) is\
      \ near -74.0\xB0. Since lower (more negative) longitudes indicate locations\
      \ further west, 94301 is indeed west of 10023."
    413e5052-1904-4a43-b466-3daddc6864c3: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the zip code 94301 in California is west of 10023 in New York. Hmm,\
      \ I need to figure out the approximate longitudes of both places because west\
      \ and east are determined by longitude. The further west a location is, the\
      \ lower its longitude (in the US, since longitude decreases as you go west from\
      \ the prime meridian). \n\nFirst, I should recall where these zip codes are.\
      \ 94301 is in California. I think that's Palo Alto, which is in the San Francisco\
      \ Bay Area. 10023 is a New York zip code, probably in Manhattan, like the Upper\
      \ West Side. \n\nNow, I need to get the longitudes of both. Let me think. New\
      \ York City is on the east coast, so its longitude is around 74 degrees west.\
      \ San Francisco is around 122 degrees west. Wait, but Palo Alto is south of\
      \ SF, but still in the same general area, so its longitude should be similar.\
      \ Let me confirm.\n\nWait, actually, longitude for NYC: Central Park is around\
      \ 73.97\xB0 W. So 10023, being in Manhattan, would be around 73.98\xB0 W. For\
      \ Palo Alto, CA (94301), the longitude is approximately 122.14\xB0 W. \n\nSince\
      \ longitude measures how far west a place is, a higher west longitude means\
      \ it's further west. Wait, no. Wait, longitude is measured from 0\xB0 at Greenwich,\
      \ increasing east and west up to 180\xB0. So, for the US, all longitudes are\
      \ west, so they are negative if using the convention where east is positive.\
      \ But in absolute terms, the higher the number in degrees west, the further\
      \ west the location. So, for example, 122\xB0 W is further west than 74\xB0\
      \ W. \n\nSo, 94301 (CA) at ~122\xB0 W is definitely west of 10023 (NY) at ~74\xB0\
      \ W. Therefore, the answer should be YES. But wait, wait, no. Wait, if you're\
      \ west of a location, that means your longitude is more to the west (higher\
      \ in degrees west, or more negative if using negative numbers for west). So,\
      \ since 122 W is further west than 74 W, then yes, 94301 is west of 10023. \n\
      \nBut let me double-check. If I have two points in the US, one in California\
      \ and one in New York, California is definitely further west. So the answer\
      \ is yes. But maybe I should confirm the exact longitudes. \n\nLooking up 94301:\
      \ Palo Alto, CA. A quick check (if I can recall) that its longitude is approximately\
      \ 122.14\xB0 W. New York City's longitude is around 73.98\xB0 W. Since 122 is\
      \ west of 73, that means Palo Alto is west of NYC. Therefore, YES.\n</think>YES\
      \  \nThe longitude of 94301 (Palo Alto, CA) is approximately 122.14\xB0 W, while\
      \ 10023 (New York, NY) is around 73.98\xB0 W. Since lower longitudes (closer\
      \ to 0\xB0) are further east, 94301, being at a higher west longitude, is located\
      \ west of 10023. \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    56176b4e-bced-47c4-bf34-fb6ed6cb8e4b: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The user wants to know if the ZIP code 94301 in California is\
      \ west of 10023 in New York. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what west means in\
      \ terms of longitude. Areas with a higher longitude (more east) are further\
      \ east, and those with lower longitude (more west) are further west. So, if\
      \ 94301 has a lower longitude than 10023, then yes, it's west.\n\nNext, I need\
      \ to find the longitudes of both ZIP codes. I know that ZIP codes in California\
      \ are generally on the west coast, so their longitude should be around -122\
      \ or so. New York ZIP codes, especially in Manhattan, which 10023 is part of\
      \ (Upper West Side), should have a longitude around -74. For example, New York\
      \ City is roughly at -74.0060\xB0 W. \n\nSo, 94301 is in Palo Alto, CA. Checking\
      \ that, Palo Alto's coordinates are approximately 37.4419\xB0 N, 122.1430\xB0\
      \ W. Wait, that latitude makes sense for Northern California. The longitude\
      \ is -122.1430. \n\nMeanwhile, 10023 in NYC is around 40.7794\xB0 N, -73.9772\xB0\
      \ W. So, comparing the longitudes: -122.1430 (CA) vs. -73.9772 (NY). Since longitude\
      \ is measured from the prime meridian (0\xB0), going west from there increases\
      \ the negative value in the Western Hemisphere. So, -122 is more west than -73.\
      \ Therefore, 94301 (CA) is indeed west of 10023 (NY). \n\nWait, but wait\u2014\
      no, actually, lower longitude (more negative) means further west. For example,\
      \ the US West Coast has longitudes around -120 to -125, while the East Coast\
      \ is around -70 to -80. So, since -122 is more west (i.e., more negative) than\
      \ -73, 94301 would actually be west of 10023. Wait, but that can't be right\
      \ because the entire US spans from about -125 (west) to -67 (east) in longitude.\
      \ So, the lower (more negative) the longitude, the further west. So, yes, California's\
      \ -122 is west of New York's -73. So the answer is YES. But wait, intuitively,\
      \ New York is on the east coast, California on the west coast. So, 94301 in\
      \ CA is west of 10023 in NY. But when looking at longitudes, since CA has a\
      \ more westerly longitude (more negative), it is indeed west of NY. Therefore,\
      \ the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \nZIP code 94301 (Palo Alto, CA) has a longitude\
      \ of approximately -122.14\xB0, while 10023 (New York, NY) is around -73.98\xB0\
      . Since lower (more negative) longitude values indicate positions further west,\
      \ 94301 is indeed west of 10023."
    5d03e5c2-c8b6-4bf9-90ef-eee4c90aedd3: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. So, the problem is asking whether the zip code 94301 in California\
      \ is west of 10023 in New York. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure out the approximate\
      \ longitudes of these two zip codes because longitude determines east-west positioning.\
      \ \n\nStarting with 94301, CA. I know that California is on the west coast of\
      \ the U.S., so its longitude should be around the west, which would be a negative\
      \ number if we're using the conventional longitude system where east is positive\
      \ and west is negative, or maybe the other way around. Wait, no\u2014longitude\
      \ is measured from the prime meridian (0\xB0), which goes through Greenwich,\
      \ England. Moving west from there, the longitude becomes negative up to -180\xB0\
      , and east is positive up to +180\xB0. So, places in the U.S. have negative\
      \ longitudes because they're west of the prime meridian.\n\nLet me get more\
      \ specific. 94301 is a zip code in California. Let me recall where that is.\
      \ I think 94301 is Palo Alto, California. Palo Alto is in the San Francisco\
      \ Bay Area, which is in Northern California. The approximate longitude of Palo\
      \ Alto should be around 122 degrees west, but I'm not 100% sure. Wait, San Francisco's\
      \ longitude is around -122.4 degrees. So Palo Alto, being south of SF, might\
      \ be similar. Let me confirm that. Maybe check a map... Well, assuming that\
      \ 94301 is Palo Alto, CA, its longitude is approximately -122.16 degrees.\n\n\
      Now, 10023 is a New York zip code. New York City is on the east coast, so its\
      \ longitude should be more positive (i.e., less negative) than California's.\
      \ For example, New York City is around -74 degrees longitude. So 10023 is likely\
      \ in Manhattan. Wait, 10023 is the Upper West Side of Manhattan. So the longitude\
      \ there is approximately -73.98 degrees.\n\nNow, comparing the two longitudes:\
      \ 94301 (CA) is at around -122.16\xB0, and 10023 (NY) is at around -73.98\xB0\
      . When dealing with longitudes, the more negative the value, the further west\
      \ it is. So, since -122.16 is more negative than -73.98, that means 94301 is\
      \ indeed west of 10023. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the directions.\
      \ Because sometimes people get confused: if a longitude is more negative, it's\
      \ further west. For example, -120\xB0 is west of -100\xB0. So yes, -122.16 is\
      \ west of -73.98. Therefore, the answer should be YES, 94301, CA is located\
      \ west of 10023, NY.\n</think>To determine if 94301, CA is west of 10023, NY,\
      \ compare their longitudes:  \n- **94301 (Palo Alto, CA):** Approximately **-122.16\xB0\
      ** longitude.  \n- **10023 (New York, NY):** Approximately **-73.98\xB0** longitude.\
      \  \n\nSince -122.16\xB0 is further west (more negative) than -73.98\xB0, **YES**,\
      \ 94301, CA is located west of 10023, NY.  \n\n**ANSWER: YES**"

      First, I should recall that in the US, California is on the west coast and New\

      \ no, longitude is measured from the prime meridian (0\xB0), going west up to\

      \ 122.14\xB0W longitude. The zip code 10023 is in New York City (Upper West\
      \ Side) at around 73.97\xB0W longitude. Since lower numerical values in west\

    e427600d-4cc9-46e9-a99f-be17acffa0a8: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the ZIP code 94301 in California is west of 10023 in New York. Hmm,\
      \ I need to figure out the approximate longitudes of both places because west\
      \ would mean a more negative or lower longitude if we're talking about the US.\
      \ \n\nFirst, I should recall that in the United States, the longitude decreases\
      \ as you go west. So, the further west a location is, the more negative its\
      \ longitude (assuming the prime meridian is 0). New York is on the East Coast,\
      \ so its longitude is around -74 or something, while California is on the West\
      \ Coast, so maybe around -122? Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me think.\n\n\
      Wait, New York City's longitude is roughly 74 degrees west, so that's around\
      \ -74.0. For example, Manhattan is around that area. The ZIP code 10023 is in\
      \ Manhattan, probably the Upper West Side. So its longitude is approximately\
      \ -73.98 or something like that. \n\nNow, 94301 is Palo Alto, California. Palo\
      \ Alto is in the Bay Area. The longitude there is around -122.1, I think. So\
      \ if -122.1 (for 94301) is west of -73.98 (for 10023), then the answer would\
      \ be yes. Because -122 is more west than -74. \n\nBut wait, longitude lines\
      \ go from 0 at the prime meridian (Greenwich) to -180 going west and +180 going\
      \ east. So numerically, the lower the longitude (more negative), the further\
      \ west it is. So yes, California's longitude is definitely more west than New\
      \ York's. Therefore, 94301, CA is west of 10023, NY.\n</think>YES.  \nTo determine\
      \ if 94301, CA is west of 10023, NY:  \n1. **Longitude of 94301 (Palo Alto,\
      \ CA):** Approximately -122.14.  \n2. **Longitude of 10023 (New York, NY):**\
      \ Approximately -73.98.  \nSince -122.14 (CA) is further west than -73.98 (NY),\
      \ the answer is **YES**."
    eb431fc0-fb68-449a-a499-eaa50b5f81ef: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question:\
      \ Is 94301, CA located west of 10023, NY? Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out\
      \ the longitudinal positions of both zip codes. \n\nFirst, I know that zip codes\
      \ in the US correspond to specific regions. 94301 is in California, and 10023\
      \ is in New York. Since California is on the West Coast and New York is on the\
      \ East Coast, my initial thought is yes, 94301 should be west of 10023. But\
      \ maybe the specific longitude coordinates could vary, so I shouldn't just assume\
      \ based on the states.\n\nLet me recall that longitude lines run north-south,\
      \ with higher values as you go east. The prime meridian is 0\xB0, and the US\
      \ is in the western hemisphere, so longitudes are negative. For example, New\
      \ York is around -74\xB0 and California around -122\xB0. Wait, no\u2014actually,\
      \ longitude west of the prime meridian is measured as negative in the decimal\
      \ system. So the more negative the longitude, the further west it is.\n\nSo\
      \ if 94301, CA has a longitude that's more west (more negative) than 10023,\
      \ NY, then yes. Let me try to remember approximate longitudes. New York City\
      \ is roughly around 74 degrees west, which would be -74.0. San Francisco, where\
      \ 94301 is (I think that's Stanford, which is near Palo Alto, part of the Bay\
      \ Area), so its longitude is around -122.3. Wait, that's way more west. But\
      \ wait, actually, San Francisco's longitude is approximately -122.4, and New\
      \ York City is around -74.0. So -122 is more west than -74, meaning 94301 is\
      \ indeed west of 10023.\n\nBut I want to be precise. Maybe I should look up\
      \ the exact coordinates for these zip codes. Let's see, 94301 is Palo Alto,\
      \ CA. Google says its coordinates are approximately 37.4440\xB0 N, 122.1600\xB0\
      \ W. Wait, but longitude is 122.16\xB0 West, which would be -122.16 in decimal\
      \ degrees. \n\nThen, 10023 is New York, NY, specifically the Upper West Side.\
      \ Its coordinates are about 40.7767\xB0 N, -73.9756\xB0 W (which is 73.9756\xB0\
      \ West, so -73.9756 in decimal).\n\nComparing the longitudes: -122.16 (94301)\
      \ vs. -73.9756 (10023). Since -122.16 is more negative than -73.9756, 94301\
      \ is further west. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES.  \n**Step-by-Step\
      \ Explanation:**  \n1. **Identify Locations:** 94301 corresponds to Palo Alto,\
      \ CA (West Coast), while 10023 is in New York City, NY (East Coast).  \n2. **Compare\
      \ Longitudes:**  \n   - 94301, CA: Approximately **-122.16\xB0** longitude.\
      \  \n   - 10023, NY: Approximately **-73.98\xB0** longitude.  \n3. **Determine\
      \ Position:** A more negative longitude indicates a western position. Since\
      \ -122.16\xB0 (CA) is further west than -73.98\xB0 (NY), **94301 is west of\
      \ 10023**.  \n\n**Answer:** YES."
    eec33bb6-d184-494e-ac79-8515a9fe07fe: "<think>Alright, so the question is whether\
      \ the ZIP code 94301 in California is located west of 10023 in New York. Let\
      \ me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that ZIP codes in\
      \ the US are organized such that the first digit represents a group of states.\
      \ For example, ZIP codes starting with 9 are generally on the West Coast, like\
      \ California, while those starting with 1 are in the Northeast, like New York.\
      \ So 94301 is in California (which is correct since 9 is for the West), and\
      \ 10023 is in New York (1 is for the Northeast, so that checks out).\n\nNow,\
      \ the main question is about the longitude. Places further west have higher\
      \ longitude values if we're using the eastern hemisphere, but actually, in the\
      \ US, longitude is measured west from the prime meridian. Wait, no, in the US,\
      \ longitude is west longitude, so the more west you go, the higher the longitude\
      \ value. Wait, no, wait\u2014longitude ranges from 0\xB0 at the prime meridian\
      \ (Greenwich) to 180\xB0E and 180\xB0W. For the US, which is west of the prime\
      \ meridian, all longitudes are west longitude, so they are measured as negative\
      \ values in decimal degrees. For example, New York is around -74\xB0 longitude,\
      \ and California is around -122\xB0 longitude. Wait, but when you go west, the\
      \ numerical value increases (becomes more negative), but in terms of actual\
      \ westness, California is further west than New York. So, comparing the two,\
      \ California has a more westerly longitude. \n\nBut maybe I should just get\
      \ the approximate longitudes of these ZIP codes. Let's recall that New York\
      \ City is in the Eastern Time Zone, and California is in the Pacific Time Zone,\
      \ which is three hours behind. Each time zone spans roughly 15 degrees of longitude.\
      \ So the difference is about 3*15=45 degrees. So New York is around, say, 74\xB0\
      W, and California around 120\xB0W? Wait, but actually, New York City's longitude\
      \ is approximately 74\xB0W, and San Francisco is around 122\xB0W. So 94301 is\
      \ Palo Alto, which is in the Bay Area, so around 122\xB0W. 10023 is likely New\
      \ York City (Upper West Side, maybe). So since 122\xB0W is west of 74\xB0W,\
      \ then yes, 94301 is west of 10023.\n\nWait, but longitude values: if a place\
      \ is further west, its longitude is a higher number in the west direction. So\
      \ 122\xB0W is further west than 74\xB0W. So California's longitude is more west,\
      \ so yes, it's west of New York. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe I can verify using a specific example. Let's think of the coordinates.\
      \ ZIP code 94301 is Palo Alto, CA. Let me check the approximate coordinates.\
      \ Palo Alto is in the San Francisco Bay Area, so its longitude is around 122.14\xB0\
      W. New York ZIP code 10023 is in Manhattan, Upper West Side. The coordinates\
      \ for that area are approximately 73.98\xB0W. Since 122.14\xB0W is further west\
      \ than 73.98\xB0W, Palo Alto is indeed west of New York City. Therefore, the\
      \ answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \nThe ZIP code 94301 (Palo Alto, CA) is located\
      \ at approximately 122.14\xB0W longitude, while 10023 (New York, NY) is around\
      \ 73.98\xB0W. Since lower numerical values (less negative) in west longitude\
      \ are further east, 94301 is indeed west of 10023."

    1cf369ec-ffd1-42aa-9641-069510628f97: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. So, the user wants to know if the zip code 70116 in Louisiana\
      \ (LA) is located west of 10014 in New York (NY). Alright, first, I need to\
      \ recall some basics about zip codes and geography.\n\nStarting with the zip\
      \ codes themselves. US zip codes are five-digit numbers where the first digit\
      \ represents a group of states. For example, zip codes starting with 0 are in\
      \ the Northeast, like Maine, whereas those starting with 7 are in the South,\
      \ including states like Louisiana. But wait, I'm not sure if the first digit\
      \ directly correlates to longitude. Maybe I need to get more specific.\n\nNext,\
      \ I should figure out the actual locations of these two zip codes. 70116 is\
      \ in Louisiana, probably New Orleans, since 701 is the main area code for New\
      \ Orleans. And 10014 is in New York, likely Manhattan, perhaps the West Village\
      \ area. Now, I need to compare their longitudes because the question is about\
      \ being west. The more west a location is, the lower its longitude value (since\
      \ longitude decreases as you go west from the prime meridian). Wait, no, actually,\
      \ in the US, longitude becomes more negative as you go west. For example, New\
      \ York is around -74 degrees longitude, while New Orleans is around -90 degrees?\
      \ Hmm, wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up cities. Let me think again.\n\nWait, New\
      \ York City is on the East Coast, so its longitude is around 74 degrees West.\
      \ New Orleans is further west, in Louisiana, so its longitude should be around\
      \ 90 degrees West? Wait, no, maybe not that far. Let me check my mental map.\
      \ The US spans from approximately 67 degrees West (east coast, like Maine) to\
      \ about 125 degrees West (west coast, like California). So New York City is\
      \ around 74\xB0W, and New Orleans would be around 90\xB0W. Wait, but that would\
      \ mean New Orleans is west of New York. But I need to confirm the exact longitudes\
      \ of these specific zip codes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the\
      \ states' positions. Louisiana is west of the Mississippi River, while New York\
      \ is on the East Coast. So Louisiana is definitely further west than New York.\
      \ Therefore, any location in Louisiana would be west of any location in New\
      \ York. But wait, is that always true? For example, if there's a place in western\
      \ New York State near Pennsylvania, maybe that's further west? But the zip code\
      \ given here is 10014, which is in New York City. New York City is at the southeastern\
      \ tip of New York State, so it's as far east as you can get in the state. Meanwhile,\
      \ 70116 is in New Orleans, which is in southeastern Louisiana. So, comparing\
      \ the two cities: New Orleans is west of New York City. Therefore, the answer\
      \ would be YES.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should check approximate coordinates.\
      \ Let me recall: NYC's coordinates are approximately 40.7128\xB0 N, 74.0060\xB0\
      \ W. New Orleans is approximately 29.9511\xB0 N, 90.0715\xB0 W. So, longitude\
      \ for NYC is about -74.0060, and for New Orleans, it's -90.0715. Since -90 is\
      \ more negative (further west) than -74, that means New Orleans is indeed west\
      \ of New York City. Therefore, the zip code 70116 in LA is west of 10014, NY.</think>YES.\
      \ To determine if 70116 (New Orleans, LA) is west of 10014 (New York City, NY),\
      \ compare their longitudes:  \n- **New York City** (10014): ~74.0060\xB0 W \
      \ \n- **New Orleans** (70116): ~90.0715\xB0 W  \n\nSince lower (more negative)\
      \ longitude values indicate western positions in the Western Hemisphere, New\
      \ Orleans is **west** of New York City.  \n\n**Answer:** YES."
    25acbbe5-33a4-4243-b8e7-ab225c34af0f: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the zip code 70116 in Louisiana is west of 10014 in New York. Hmm, let's start\
      \ by recalling what I know about zip codes and their geographical locations.\n\
      \nFirst, I know that zip codes in the US are organized such that the first digit\
      \ represents a group of states. For example, zip codes starting with 0 are in\
      \ the Northeast, like Maine, Vermont, etc. Then as the numbers go up, they move\
      \ south and west. So, New York zip codes probably start with 1, right? Let me\
      \ check that... Yes, New York is in the Northeast, and I think their zip codes\
      \ start with 1, like 10014. That makes sense because New York City is a major\
      \ area, so the first digits might be lower. \n\nThen, Louisiana's zip codes\
      \ must start with 7, since 70116 starts with a 7. I remember that the southern\
      \ states like Louisiana, Texas, etc., have higher starting numbers. So, 7 would\
      \ be somewhere in the South. But wait, how does the numbering go exactly? The\
      \ first digit for the Eastern states starts lower, and increases as you go west.\
      \ So the West Coast has zip codes starting with 9, like California. But Louisiana\
      \ is in the South, not the West. But the key here is longitude\u2014since we're\
      \ comparing east-west positions, the longitude of each zip code's location will\
      \ determine which is further west.\n\nSo I need to find the approximate longitude\
      \ of 70116 (Louisiana) and 10014 (New York). The one with the more western longitude\
      \ (i.e., a more negative number if we're using the standard coordinate system\
      \ where west longitudes are negative) would be considered west of the other.\n\
      \nLet me think: New York City is on the east coast, so its longitude is around\
      \ 74 degrees west. For example, Manhattan is roughly at 74.0060\xB0 W. The zip\
      \ code 10014 is in Manhattan's West Village area, so its longitude should be\
      \ around that. \n\nNow, Louisiana's 70116 is in New Orleans, right? New Orleans\
      \ is in southeastern Louisiana, along the Mississippi River. The longitude of\
      \ New Orleans is approximately 90 degrees west. Wait, no, that's too far. Wait,\
      \ maybe that's the latitude. Let me recall: New Orleans is at around 29.95\xB0\
      \ N latitude and 90.07\xB0 W longitude. Wait, is that correct? Wait, no. Let\
      \ me double-check. Maybe I'm mixing up New Orleans with another city. For example,\
      \ the longitude of New Orleans is actually around 90.07\xB0 W. But New York\
      \ City is around 74\xB0 W. So 90\xB0 W is further west than 74\xB0 W. So if\
      \ 70116 is in New Orleans, then its longitude is more west than 10014 in NYC,\
      \ so the answer would be YES, 70116 is west of 10014.\n\nBut wait, I need to\
      \ make sure that 70116 is indeed in New Orleans. Let me confirm the zip code\
      \ 70116. A quick recall: New Orleans has zip codes starting with 701, so 70116\
      \ would be a specific area there. Yes, that's correct. So if the longitude of\
      \ New Orleans is around 90\xB0 W and NYC is around 74\xB0 W, then New Orleans\
      \ is definitely west of NYC. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine\
      \ if 70116, LA is west of 10014, NY:  \n1. **Zip Code Regions**: 70116 (Louisiana)\
      \ starts with \"7,\" indicating the South-Central US, while 10014 (New York)\
      \ starts with \"1,\" representing the Northeast.  \n2. **Longitude Comparison**:\

      \ (70116) is near 90\xB0 W longitude.  \n3. **Conclusion**: Since 90\xB0 W is\
      \ farther west than 74\xB0 W, **70116, LA is west of 10014, NY**.  \n\nANSWER:\
      \ YES"
    267bbfcd-ea4f-45d0-a543-0016ec825109: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure out if\
      \ the zip code 70116 in Louisiana is west of 10014 in New York. Hmm, I know\
      \ zip codes in the US generally correspond to areas, but I'm not exactly sure\
      \ how to determine their longitude. First, I need to find out the approximate\
      \ longitude of each zip code because the west-east position is determined by\
      \ longitude. The lower the longitude (more negative in the US), the further\
      \ west it is.\n\nSo, starting with 70116, LA. That's Louisiana. New Orleans,\
      \ maybe? I think New Orleans is in Louisiana. Let me recall, the zip codes starting\
      \ with 7 are in the south-central area, like Louisiana, Texas, etc. New Orleans\
      \ is a big city there. Now, New Orleans is along the Mississippi River, which\
      \ flows into the Gulf of Mexico. I remember that New Orleans is in the southern\
      \ part of Louisiana, and Louisiana is in the Central Time Zone. Central Time\
      \ Zone is UTC-6, while New York is in Eastern Time Zone, UTC-5. But time zones\
      \ are a rough guide. Actual longitude is better.\n\nThe longitude of New Orleans,\
      \ LA. Let me think. I believe New Orleans is around 90 degrees west longitude.\
      \ Maybe 90.07 or something like that. Let me check in my mind. For example,\
      \ the meridian 90\xB0W passes through parts of Louisiana. So New Orleans is\
      \ close to that. So maybe 70116 is around 90\xB0W.\n\nNow, 10014, NY. That's\
      \ New York City. Specifically, the West Village in Manhattan. The longitude\
      \ of New York City is around 74 degrees west. So like 74.01\xB0W. Since New\
      \ York is on the east coast, it's further east. So 74\xB0W is more east than\
      \ 90\xB0W. Wait, actually, lower longitude numbers (like 74 vs 90) mean it's\
      \ further east. Because longitude decreases as you go east. So 74\xB0W is east\
      \ of 90\xB0W. So if 70116 is at 90\xB0W and 10014 is at 74\xB0W, then 70116\
      \ is west of 10014. Wait, but 90 is a larger number west, meaning it's further\
      \ west. So yes, 70116 would be west of 10014. But I need to confirm the exact\
      \ longitudes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the general positions.\
      \ Louisiana is to the west of the Eastern Seaboard. New York is on the east\
      \ coast, so Louisiana is definitely west of New York. So regardless of the specific\
      \ zip codes, the state of Louisiana is west of New York. Therefore, any zip\
      \ code in Louisiana would be west of any in New York. But wait, is that necessarily\
      \ true? For example, if there's a zip code in eastern Louisiana near the Mississippi\
      \ border, and one in western New York, maybe? But New York State is north of\
      \ Pennsylvania, and Louisiana is south. But in terms of east-west, Louisiana\
      \ is west of the eastern states. So New York City is on the east coast, so definitely\
      \ east of Louisiana. Therefore, 70116, LA is west of 10014, NY. So the answer\
      \ is YES. But let me double-check the longitudes to be sure.\n\nNew Orleans,\
      \ LA: approximate longitude is about 90.07\xB0W. New York City's longitude is\
      \ around 74.01\xB0W. Since 90.07\xB0W is more west (higher in absolute terms\
      \ for west longitude), 70116 is indeed west of 10014. So the answer is YES.\n\

      \ Because New Orleans has a lot of 701** codes. Then 10014 is in New York. New\
      \ York City's ZIP codes often start with 100. The 10014 area is probably Greenwich\
      \ Village or somewhere in Manhattan.\n\nNow, to determine if one is west of\
      \ the other, I need to compare their longitudes. Places further west have higher\
      \ longitude values if we're talking about the western hemisphere, but wait,\
      \ actually, in the US, longitude is measured west from the Prime Meridian. So,\
      \ the more west a location is, the more negative its longitude becomes when\
      \ expressed in the Western Hemisphere. Wait, no\u2014longitude for the US is\
      \ west longitude, so it's measured as negative values. For example, New York\
      \ is around -74 degrees, and New Orleans is around -90 degrees. Wait, wait,\
      \ no\u2014that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, longitude lines\
      \ go from 0 at the Prime Meridian (Greenwich) to 180 east and 180 west. The\
      \ US is west of the Prime Meridian, so all longitudes are west (negative) in\
      \ decimal degrees. New York City's longitude is approximately -74.0060, and\
      \ New Orleans is around -90.0715. So, comparing the two, New Orleans has a more\
      \ negative longitude. Wait, but when we say a place is west of another, the\
      \ one with the more western longitude (i.e., a more negative number in the western\
      \ hemisphere) would be further west. So, is -90.0715 west of -74.0060? Yes,\
      \ because -90 is further west than -74. So New Orleans (70116) is west of New\
      \ York (10014). Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n\nWait, but let me double-check\
      \ the actual coordinates. Maybe I got the longitudes mixed up. Let me recall:\
      \ New York City is on the east coast, so its longitude is around 74 degrees\
      \ west. New Orleans is in the Gulf Coast area, which would be more to the west.\
      \ So, New Orleans is indeed west of New York City. So, the answer is YES. But\
      \ to make sure, perhaps I should look up approximate longitudes. From memory,\
      \ NYC is roughly 40.7\xB0 N, 74\xB0 W. New Orleans is about 29.95\xB0 N, 90.07\xB0\
      \ W. Wait, no, 90 degrees west is actually further west. Wait, but wait, 74\
      \ degrees west versus 90 degrees west. Since 90 is west of 74, that would make\
      \ New Orleans further west. So yes, 70116 (New Orleans, LA) is west of 10014\
      \ (New York, NY). So the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine if ZIP code 70116\
      \ (Louisiana) is west of 10014 (New York), compare their longitudes:  \n- New\

    66791043-d685-4380-953e-0766b7cf6ec6: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user is asking if the zip code 70116 in Louisiana (LA) is located\
      \ west of 10014 in New York (NY). Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure out the\
      \ approximate longitude of each zip code because longitude determines east-west\
      \ position. The further west a location is, the higher its longitude value (in\
      \ the Western Hemisphere, since west longitudes are negative, but sometimes\
      \ they're represented as positive with a 'W' designation). Wait, actually, in\
      \ the US, longitudes are negative because they're west of the prime meridian.\
      \ So, a more negative longitude means further west.\n\nBut maybe I should start\
      \ by finding the actual coordinates for both zip codes. Let me recall: 70116\
      \ is a New Orleans zip code. New Orleans is in southeastern Louisiana, right\
      \ along the Mississippi River. And 10014 is in New York City, specifically the\
      \ West Village area of Manhattan. \n\nSo, New Orleans is in the Central Time\
      \ Zone, while NYC is in the Eastern Time Zone. Time zones can sometimes give\
      \ a rough idea of east-west positioning, but they're not exact. For example,\
      \ parts of the Central Time Zone might be further east than some parts of the\
      \ Eastern Time Zone. But generally, Central is west of Eastern. However, New\
      \ Orleans is in the Central Time Zone, which is west of Eastern, so that might\
      \ suggest that 70116 is west of 10014. But I need to check the actual longitudes.\n\
      \nLet me think about the approximate longitudes. New York City's longitude is\
      \ around 74 degrees west. For example, the Statue of Liberty is at approximately\
      \ 74.0445\xB0 W. The West Village would be around there. New Orleans is around\
      \ 90 degrees west. Wait, no, that's too far. Wait, New Orleans is actually around\
      \ 90 degrees west? Let me confirm. The approximate coordinates for New Orleans\
      \ are 29.95\xB0 N latitude, 90.07\xB0 W longitude. Yes, that's right. So New\
      \ Orleans is at about 90\xB0W, while NYC is around 74\xB0W. \n\nWait, but longitude\
      \ west increases as you go west. So 90\xB0W is further west than 74\xB0W. So\
      \ if 70116 (New Orleans) is at 90\xB0W and 10014 (NYC) is at 74\xB0W, then New\
      \ Orleans is indeed west of NYC. Therefore, the answer should be YES. \n\nBut\
      \ wait, let me double-check. Maybe I mixed up the longitudes. Let me think again.\
      \ The prime meridian is 0\xB0, and as you go west, the longitude becomes negative\
      \ in decimal degrees (or sometimes denoted as W). So, for example, New York\
      \ is around -74\xB0 (74\xB0W), and New Orleans is around -90\xB0 (90\xB0W).\
      \ Since -90 is less than -74, but in terms of westness, 90\xB0W is further west\
      \ than 74\xB0W. So yes, New Orleans is west of New York City. Therefore, the\
      \ zip code 70116 in LA is west of 10014 in NY. So the answer is YES.\n</think>To\

      \ 90\xB0W (LA), the one with the higher numerical value west (since 90 is more\
      \ than 74) would be further west. Wait, longitude values become more negative\
      \ as you go west. So, -90 is more west than -74. So yes, New Orleans is west\
      \ of New York City. \n\nTherefore, 70116 (LA) is west of 10014 (NY). So the\

      \ out if the zip code 70116 in Louisiana is located west of 10014 in New York.\
      \ Hmm, first, I should recall that zip codes in the US are generally assigned\
      \ from east to west, with the lower numbers starting in the northeast and increasing\
      \ as you move west and south. But I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate for\
      \ all regions. Maybe I should check where exactly these two zip codes are located.\n\
      \nStarting with 10014, NY. New York zip codes starting with '10' are probably\
      \ in New York City. Let me think... 10014 is the West Village area in Manhattan.\
      \ So that's in New York City, which is on the east coast of the US.\n\nNow,\
      \ 70116 is in Louisiana. Louisiana zip codes start with '70', I believe. New\
      \ Orleans has zip codes starting with 701. So 70116 would be somewhere in New\

      \ Quarter area, perhaps? Or maybe another neighborhood there. Regardless, New\
      \ Orleans is in Louisiana, which is in the southern part of the US, along the\
      \ Gulf of Mexico.\n\nNow, the question is whether New Orleans, LA (70116) is\
      \ west of New York City, NY (10014). To determine this, I need to compare their\
      \ longitudes. Places farther west have higher longitude values if we're using\
      \ the standard where west longitudes are negative numbers. Wait, in the US,\
      \ all longitudes are west of the prime meridian, so they are negative. For example,\
      \ New York City is around -74 degrees longitude, and New Orleans is around -90\
      \ degrees. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think more carefully.\n\
      \nNew York City's longitude is approximately 74 degrees West (so -74 in decimal).\
      \ New Orleans is around 90 degrees West (decimal -90)? Wait, no, that's too\
      \ far. Wait, actually, the continental US spans from about 67 degrees West (east\
      \ coast) to around 125 degrees West (west coast). So New York City is roughly\
      \ at 74\xB0W longitude. New Orleans is in Louisiana, which is in the central\
      \ southern part. Let me recall: Louisiana's longitude. New Orleans is at approximately\
      \ 90\xB0W? Wait, no, because Chicago is around 87\xB0W, so New Orleans might\
      \ be around 90\xB0W. Wait, let me check approximate longitudes.\n\nWait, if\
      \ I recall, the longitude for New York City (Manhattan) is approximately 74.0\xB0\
      \ W. New Orleans is around 90.0\xB0 W. But wait, 90\xB0W would be somewhere\
      \ like Memphis, Tennessee, maybe? Let me think. For example, Chicago is around\
      \ 87.6\xB0W. St. Louis is around 90\xB0W. So New Orleans is actually a bit south\
      \ of that. Maybe New Orleans is around 90\xB0W. Let's see: A quick mental check\u2014\
      Memphis is 90\xB0W, and New Orleans is further south along the Mississippi River.\
      \ So Memphis is at 90\xB0W, and New Orleans is southeast of there, so maybe\
      \ longitude 90\xB0W. Wait, but maybe a bit more. For example, Baton Rouge is\
      \ around 91.1\xB0W, so New Orleans would be a bit east of that, maybe 90\xB0\
      W. Hmm.\n\nIf New York is at 74\xB0W and New Orleans is at 90\xB0W, then New\
      \ Orleans is west of New York. Because 90\xB0W is further west than 74\xB0W\
      \ (since in the west direction, the longitude becomes more negative or higher\
      \ in magnitude). Wait, no\u2014when you go west, the longitude becomes more\
      \ negative (if using the convention that east is positive). Wait, no, in the\
      \ US, all longitudes are west, so expressed as negative numbers. So New York\
      \ is -74\xB0, and New Orleans is -90\xB0. But when comparing westness, the more\
      \ negative (lower number) a longitude is, the further west it is. Wait, no,\
      \ that's incorrect. Wait, longitude is measured from 0\xB0 at the prime meridian\
      \ (Greenwich), increasing eastward to 180\xB0E and westward to 180\xB0W. But\
      \ in the US, all longitudes are west of the prime meridian, so they are given\
      \ as degrees west, which are equivalent to negative values in the decimal system.\
      \ So, for example, 74\xB0W is -74, and 90\xB0W is -90. When comparing, the location\
      \ with the more negative longitude (i.e., smaller value) is further west. So\
      \ -90 is less than -74, meaning 90\xB0W is further west than 74\xB0W. Therefore,\
      \ New Orleans (90\xB0W) is west of New York City (74\xB0W). So the answer would\
      \ be YES, 70116, LA is west of 10014, NY.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me confirm\
      \ this. For example, if you have a longitude of -90 (90\xB0W) and -74 (74\xB0\
      W), then -90 is further west than -74. Because as you go west from the prime\
      \ meridian, the longitude becomes more negative. So yes, New Orleans at 90\xB0\
      W is indeed west of New York at 74\xB0W. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES\

    e477e5b7-474e-41d6-96ff-0e3d6461ec1e: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure out whether\
      \ the zip code 70116 in Louisiana is west of 10014 in New York. Hmm, I'm not\
      \ super familiar with zip codes and their exact locations, but I know that generally,\
      \ Louisiana is in the southern part of the US, and New York is in the northeast.\
      \ So, directionally, Louisiana would be southwest of New York. But wait, the\
      \ question is specifically about west, not southwest. So maybe I need to check\
      \ the longitude of each zip code to see which one is further west.\n\nFirst,\
      \ I remember that longitude measures east-west position. The lower the longitude,\
      \ the further west a location is. So if 70116 has a lower longitude than 10014,\
      \ then it's west. But I need to find the actual longitudes of these two zip\
      \ codes.\n\nLet me think. Zip code 10014 is in New York. I think that's Greenwich\
      \ Village in Manhattan. New York City is on the east coast, so its longitude\
      \ should be around -74 degrees. For Louisiana, specifically New Orleans, since\
      \ 70116 is a New Orleans zip code (maybe the French Quarter?), the longitude\
      \ there is approximately -90 degrees. Wait, no, New Orleans is around 90 degrees\
      \ west longitude, which would be -90 in decimal terms. But New York is around\
      \ -74. So -90 is further west than -74. Wait, but longitude goes from 0 at Greenwich,\
      \ increasing east and west. So west longitudes are negative in the US. So the\
      \ more negative the number, the further west it is? Wait, actually, no. Let\
      \ me get that straight. Prime meridian is 0. Locations west of that (like the\
      \ Americas) have longitudes from 0 to -180, and east is 0 to +180. So, a longitude\
      \ of -74 would be 74 degrees west, and -90 is 90 degrees west. So 90 degrees\
      \ west is further west than 74 degrees west. So New Orleans at around -90 is\
      \ west of New York's -74.\n\nTherefore, zip code 70116 in Louisiana (New Orleans)\
      \ would indeed be west of 10014 in New York. Wait, but let me confirm the exact\
      \ longitudes of these specific zip codes. Maybe I should quickly look up or\

      \ the zip code 90069 in California is west of 10003 in New York. Hmm. Let's\
      \ start by recalling what I know about zip codes in the US. Zip codes are postal\
      \ codes used by the USPS, and they generally follow a geographical system. The\
      \ first digit represents a region. For example, zip codes starting with 9 are\
      \ in the western part of the US, like California. On the other hand, zip codes\
      \ starting with 1 are in the northeastern area, such as New York. \n\nSo 90069\
      \ starts with 9, which is California, and 10003 starts with 1, which is New\
      \ York. Now, I need to determine the longitudinal coordinates of these two zip\
      \ codes to see which is further west. Since west longitude is measured as negative\
      \ numbers in the US, the more negative the longitude, the further west it is.\
      \ \n\nBut how do I find the actual longitude of each zip code? I might need\
      \ to look up the approximate longitude for these specific zip codes. Let me\
      \ think. 90069 is a well-known zip code in Los Angeles, probably around Hollywood\
      \ or West Hollywood. 10003 is in New York City, likely Manhattan, maybe Greenwich\
      \ Village or East Village area. \n\nFrom what I remember, Los Angeles is on\
      \ the west coast, so its longitude is around -118 degrees. New York City is\
      \ on the east coast, with a longitude around -74 degrees. Since longitude decreases\
      \ as you go west, Los Angeles (around -118) is definitely west of New York City\
      \ (around -74). Therefore, 90069, CA, should be west of 10003, NY. \n\nWait,\
      \ is there any chance that a specific zip code in New York might be further\
      \ west than a California one? Probably not, since California is on the west\
      \ coast and New York is on the east. Even if a New York zip code was in the\
      \ western part of the state, like near Buffalo, which is around -78.8 longitude,\
      \ that's still east of Los Angeles. But 10003 is in NYC, which is around -73.9,\
      \ so definitely east. \n\nI think the answer is yes. But let me double-check.\
      \ Maybe there's a mistake in assuming the general areas. Let me confirm the\
      \ longitude of 90069. A quick recall: Los Angeles is approximately 34\xB0N latitude,\
      \ -118\xB0W longitude. The exact zip code 90069 is West Hollywood area. So longitude\
      \ is roughly -118.38. \n\n10003 in NYC is Greenwich Village area. The coordinates\
      \ for NYC are approximately 40.7\xB0N, -74.0\xB0W. So -74.0 for NYC compared\
      \ to -118.38 for LA. Since -118.38 is further west (more negative), that means\
      \ 90069 is west of 10003. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES\
      \  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Zip Code Regions**: 90069 (CA) starts\
      \ with 9, indicating the West; 10003 (NY) starts with 1, indicating the Northeast.\

      \  \n3. **Comparison**: Lower (more negative) longitude = farther west. Since\
      \ -118.38 < -74.00, **90069, CA is west of 10003, NY**.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    3ec3f64f-6282-4200-8c1e-eeaead2faf43: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the zip code 90069 in California is west of 10003 in New York. Let's start\
      \ by recalling that in the US, zip codes can sometimes give a rough idea of\
      \ location, especially the first few digits. California zip codes generally\
      \ start with 9, and New York with 1, but I think that's more about regions rather\
      \ than exact east-west positioning.\n\nFirst, I should identify the actual locations\
      \ of these zip codes. 90069 is in California. I know that 90069 is the zip code\
      \ for West Hollywood, which is in the Los Angeles area. Then 10003 is a New\
      \ York zip code, specifically in Manhattan, New York City. So the question is\
      \ whether Los Angeles is west of New York City. \n\nBut wait, cities can be\
      \ large, so maybe the specific coordinates matter. Let me think. Los Angeles\
      \ is definitely on the west coast, and New York is on the east coast. So generally,\
      \ yes, LA is west of NYC. But maybe there's a trick here. Are there parts of\
      \ New York that are further west than parts of California? Well, the state of\
      \ New York extends west to around 79 degrees longitude, but California's westernmost\
      \ point is around 124 degrees west. Wait, longitude decreases as you go west\
      \ in the US. So New York City is around 74 degrees west longitude, while Los\
      \ Angeles is around 118 degrees west. Wait, no\u2014longitude is measured from\
      \ the prime meridian (0 degrees) going west. So higher numbers west of the prime\
      \ meridian are further west. Wait, no. Let me correct that. For example, New\
      \ York City is at approximately 74 degrees West longitude, and Los Angeles is\
      \ around 118 degrees West. Since 118 is a larger number than 74, that means\
      \ Los Angeles is further west. Because as you go west from the prime meridian,\
      \ the longitude increases in the western hemisphere. So yes, 118W is more west\
      \ than 74W. So LA is west of NYC. Therefore, 90069, CA is west of 10003, NY.\
      \ So the answer is YES.\n</think>YES. California's zip code 90069 (West Hollywood,\

      \ move west and south. But I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate for all\
      \ cases.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the locations of these two zip codes. 90069\
      \ is in California, specifically I think that's the West Hollywood area, right?\
      \ And 10003 is in New York, probably Manhattan, like Greenwich Village or East\
      \ Village maybe? So California is on the west coast and New York is on the east\
      \ coast. But zip codes can sometimes cross into different areas, so maybe the\
      \ specific coordinates matter more here.\n\nI should check the longitude of\
      \ each zip code because longitude determines how east or west a location is.\
      \ The further west the longitude (more negative if using the prime meridian\
      \ as 0), the more west the location is. But wait, in the US, longitudes are\
      \ west of the prime meridian, so they are negative values. For example, New\
      \ York is around -74 degrees longitude, and Los Angeles is around -118 degrees.\
      \ Wait, no, actually, Los Angeles is around -118, and New York is around -74.\
      \ Since -118 is more negative than -74, that means Los Angeles is further west.\
      \ So if 90069 is in LA, then yes, it's west of 10003 in NY. But let me verify\
      \ the exact longitudes to be sure.\n\nLooking up 90069, CA: According to my\

      \ with lower numbers starting in the east and increasing as you move west. But\
      \ wait, does that apply here? Let me think.\n\nSo, California is on the west\

      \ 9, like 90069, which I think is in the Los Angeles area, maybe West Hollywood?\
      \ \n\nBut the actual longitude is what matters here. To determine if one location\
      \ is west of another, I need to compare their longitudes. Places with more westerly\
      \ longitudes (higher negative numbers if we're using the prime meridian as 0)\
      \ would be further west. So I should find the longitude of both zip codes. \n\
      \nWait, how do I get the longitude for these zip codes? Well, maybe I can recall\
      \ approximate longitudes. Los Angeles is around 118 degrees West, and New York\
      \ City is around 74 degrees West. Wait, because longitude west means it's measured\
      \ from the prime meridian going west. So a higher numerical value (like 118W)\
      \ is further west than a lower one (74W). So Los Angeles at 118W is indeed west\
      \ of New York City at 74W. Therefore, 90069 (LA area) is west of 10003 (NYC).\
      \ So the answer should be YES.\n\nBut let me make sure. Maybe check specific\
      \ locations. 90069 is West Hollywood, CA. 10003 is in Manhattan, NY. So West\
      \ Hollywood is definitely west of Manhattan. But wait, I'm assuming that the\
      \ entire state of California is west of New York, which is true. So regardless\
      \ of specific zip codes within the states, since CA is west of NY, any CA zip\
      \ code would be west of any NY zip code. But is that always true? What about\
      \ the westernmost part of New York state versus the easternmost part of California?\
      \ Wait, New York state is in the east, but California is on the west coast.\
      \ The eastern border of California is still far west compared to New York. For\
      \ example, the easternmost point in California is around 114W longitude (near\
      \ the Colorado River), and New York's westernmost point is around 79.7W (near\
      \ Lake Erie). So 114W is still west of 79.7W, meaning all of California is west\

      \ I should look up the actual longitudes. Let me think. 90069 is a well-known\
      \ zip code in Los Angeles, probably West Hollywood or somewhere around there.\
      \ The longitude for LA is around 118 degrees west. New York City's longitude\
      \ is about 74 degrees west. Wait, longitude west increases as you go west from\
      \ the prime meridian. So higher west longitude means further west. So 118\xB0\
      W is further west than 74\xB0W. So yes, 90069 (LA) is west of 10003 (NYC). \n\
      \nTherefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\
      \  \n1. **Zip Code Regions:** 90069 (CA) starts with '9', indicating the western\
      \ US, while 10003 (NY) starts with '1', indicating the northeastern US.  \n\
      2. **Longitude Comparison:**  \n   - Los Angeles, CA (90069) is at approximately\
      \ 118\xB0W longitude.  \n   - New York, NY (10003) is at approximately 74\xB0\
      W longitude.  \n3. **Conclusion:** Since 118\xB0W is farther west than 74\xB0\
      W, **90069, CA is west of 10003, NY.**"
    fc9cb756-c66b-4300-bfdd-508e7a8bdfdc: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure out if\
      \ the zip code 90069 in California is west of 10003 in New York. Hmm. First,\
      \ I remember that zip codes in the US are generally assigned from east to west,\
      \ with lower numbers starting in the northeast and increasing as you go west.\
      \ So like the eastern states have lower zip codes, and the west coast has higher\
      \ ones. For example, I think New York starts with 1, like 100xx for Manhattan,\
      \ and California has zip codes starting with 9, so 90069 would be in the Los\
      \ Angeles area maybe. \n\nBut wait, does the zip code numbering strictly follow\
      \ longitude? Maybe not exactly, because they're assigned by the USPS based on\
      \ regions, not precise coordinates. But generally, the first digit does indicate\
      \ a region. So 9 is for the western states (like California, Hawaii, Alaska)\
      \ and 0 is for the northeast (like New York, Massachusetts). So 10003 is in\
      \ New York, which is on the east coast, and 90069 is in California, which is\
      \ on the west coast. But the question is about whether 90069 is west of 10003.\
      \ So geographically, California is definitely west of New York. Los Angeles\
      \ is much further west than New York City. So even though the zip code numbers\
      \ are higher in the west, it's because of the regional numbering, but the actual\
      \ longitude would confirm this.\n\nBut maybe I should check the actual longitude\
      \ coordinates of both zip codes to be sure. Let me think: 10003 is in New York\
      \ City, probably Manhattan. The longitude for NYC is around 74 degrees west.\
      \ For 90069, that's West Hollywood, Los Angeles, which has a longitude of around\
      \ 118 degrees west. Wait, longitude west increases as you go west from the prime\
      \ meridian. Wait, no, longitude west is measured as degrees west of the prime\
      \ meridian. So higher numbers (like 118W) are further west than lower numbers\
      \ (74W). So 118W is west of 74W. So yes, Los Angeles is west of New York City.\
      \ Therefore, 90069, CA is indeed west of 10003, NY. So the answer should be\
      \ YES.\n</think>YES. The zip code 90069 in California (West Hollywood) has a\
      \ longitude of approximately 118.38\xB0W, while 10003 in New York (Manhattan)\
      \ is around 73.99\xB0W. Since lower longitude values (more easterly) are to\
      \ the east, 90069 is west of 10003. \n\n**Answer:** YES"

    0dcda351-39fc-49e9-a2f9-cfe64434b3f5: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the zip code 90210 in California is west of the zip code 10011 in New York.\
      \ Let me start by recalling that zip codes in the US generally correspond to\
      \ areas from the east coast to the west coast. The lower zip codes are on the\
      \ east, and they get higher as you move west. But wait, I think that's a bit\
      \ oversimplified. Let me check my understanding.\n\nFirst, I know that the first\
      \ digit of a zip code represents a group of states. For example, zip codes starting\
      \ with 0 are in the Northeast, like Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and some\
      \ New England states. Wait, actually, zip codes starting with 0 are for the\
      \ Northeast, then as you go west, the first digit increases. So the first digit\
      \ ranges from 0 in the east to 9 in the west. So California zip codes start\
      \ with 9, right? New York is in the Northeast, so their zip codes start with\
      \ 1. So 10011 starts with 1, which would be New York, and 90210 starts with\
      \ 9, which is California. So based on the first digit, California is west of\
      \ New York. But wait, maybe I should check the actual longitude coordinates\
      \ of these specific zip codes because sometimes there might be exceptions.\n\
      \nLet me look up where exactly 90210, CA is. I think Beverly Hills uses 90210.\
      \ Beverly Hills is in Southern California, near Los Angeles. The longitude for\
      \ Los Angeles is around 118 degrees west. Then 10011 is in New York City, probably\
      \ Manhattan. The longitude of New York City is about 74 degrees west. Since\
      \ longitude increases as you go west, 118W is further west than 74W. So California's\
      \ 90210 (Beverly Hills) would be west of New York's 10011 (Manhattan). \n\n\
      Wait, but the initial thought about the first digit of the zip code increasing\
      \ as you go west seems to align here. 9 is the highest first digit, so California\
      \ is indeed west of New York. But just to confirm, maybe there are parts of\
      \ California with lower zip codes? Probably not, because the 9 is assigned to\
      \ the westernmost regions. So, yes, 90210 is in California, which is west of\
      \ New York's 10011. The answer should be YES.\n</think>YES.  \n**Step-by-Step\
      \ Explanation:**  \n1. **Zip Code Regions:** The first digit of US zip codes\
      \ generally increases from east to west. New York (East Coast) starts with 0-1,\
      \ while California (West Coast) starts with 9.  \n2. **Specific Locations:**\

      \ Beverly Hills. And 10011 is a New York zip code, maybe in Manhattan like Chelsea\

      \ the zip code 90210 in California is west of the zip code 10011 in New York.\
      \ Let's start by recalling some basic geography. California is on the west coast\

      \ City. \n\nBut wait, longitude is the key here. The further west a location\
      \ is, the higher its longitude value (in the Western Hemisphere, longitude is\

      \ in the US, all longitudes are west, so they are negative numbers. For example,\
      \ New York's longitude is around -74 degrees, and Los Angeles is around -118\
      \ degrees. Wait, but lower numbers (less negative) are further east. So New\

      \ are negative. So, for example, New York is around -74\xB0 longitude, and Los\
      \ Angeles is around -118\xB0, right? \n\nWait, but when comparing westness,\
      \ a more negative longitude (like -118) would actually be further west than\
      \ a less negative one (like -74). Because moving west from the prime meridian\

    c8250856-8259-4ec0-8706-103ea91f097e: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ The user wants to know if the ZIP code 90210 in California is located west\
      \ of 10011 in New York. Okay, first, I need to recall some basics about ZIP\
      \ codes and geography in the US.\n\nSo, ZIP codes in the US are structured where\
      \ the first digit represents a group of states. For example, eastern states\
      \ like New York start with 0 or 1, while western states like California have\
      \ higher numbers. Wait, actually, let me confirm that. From what I remember,\
      \ the first digit of the ZIP code increases as you move from the east coast\
      \ to the west coast. So the eastern states like Maine, New York, etc., have\
      \ ZIP codes starting with 0 or 1, and as you go west, the numbers go up. California,\
      \ being on the west coast, should have ZIP codes starting with 9. Let me check\
      \ the examples given. 90210 is California, which starts with 9, and 10011 is\
      \ New York, starting with 1. So that fits the pattern.\n\nNow, the actual question\
      \ is whether 90210 (CA) is west of 10011 (NY). Since California is on the west\
      \ coast and New York is on the east coast, generally, California is west of\
      \ New York. But ZIP codes can sometimes cross state lines or have anomalies,\
      \ so maybe I should verify the longitudinal coordinates of these specific ZIP\
      \ codes.\n\nLet me think. ZIP code 90210 is Beverly Hills, California. The approximate\
      \ longitude for Beverly Hills is around 118.4 degrees west. ZIP code 10011 is\
      \ New York City, specifically the Chelsea area. The longitude for NYC is approximately\
      \ 74 degrees west. Since longitude measures east-west position, with higher\
      \ values (more west) being further west. So 118.4\xB0W is further west than\
      \ 74\xB0W, which means Beverly Hills, CA (90210) is indeed west of New York\
      \ City, NY (10011).\n\nWait, but longitude west coordinates: lower numbers (closer\
      \ to 0) are more east, and higher numbers are more west. So 74\xB0W is east\
      \ compared to 118\xB0W. Therefore, 90210 is west of 10011. So the answer should\
      \ be YES.\n\nBut let me make sure there's no mistake here. Maybe I should double-check\
      \ the longitudes. Let's see, New York City is around 40.7\xB0N latitude, -73.9\xB0\
      E longitude (though longitude is west, so it's 73.9\xB0W). Beverly Hills is\
      \ approximately 34.07\xB0N, -118.4\xB0E (118.4\xB0W). Comparing the two longitudes:\
      \ 73.9\xB0W vs 118.4\xB0W. The larger the number in the west, the further west\
      \ the location. Therefore, 118.4 is further west. So yes, 90210 is west of 10011.\n\

      \ I know that ZIP codes in the US are generally assigned from east to west.\
      \ The eastern states have lower starting numbers, and as you move west, the\
      \ numbers increase. For example, New York starts with 1, and California has\
      \ higher numbers like 9. But does that directly translate to longitude? Maybe\
      \ not exactly, but it's a start.\n\nWait, let's break it down. 90210 is in California,\
      \ specifically Beverly Hills, I think. And 10011 is in New York City, probably\
      \ Manhattan. So, California is on the West Coast and New York is on the East\
      \ Coast. Generally, the West Coast is west of the East Coast. So intuitively,\
      \ yes, Beverly Hills would be west of New York City. But maybe there's a specific\
      \ longitude comparison needed here.\n\nI should check the longitudes of both\
      \ places. Let me recall: New York City is around 74 degrees west longitude.\
      \ Los Angeles is about 118 degrees west. Wait, the more west you go, the higher\
      \ the longitude value in the western hemisphere. So Los Angeles (118\xB0W) is\
      \ farther west than New York (74\xB0W). Therefore, 90210 (CA) is west of 10011\
      \ (NY). So the answer is YES. But wait, am I mixing up east and west longitudes?\
      \ No, in the US, all longitudes are west of the Prime Meridian, so they are\
      \ all negative if we consider the convention where east is positive and west\
      \ is negative. But regardless, numerically, 118 degrees west is further west\
      \ than 74 degrees west. So yes, CA is west of NY. Therefore, the answer must\
      \ be YES.\n</think>YES. California (90210) is located on the West Coast, while\
      \ New York (10011) is on the East Coast. The longitude of Beverly Hills, CA\
      \ (~118.4\xB0W) is farther west than New York City (~74.0\xB0W). Thus, 90210,\
      \ CA is indeed west of 10011, NY. \n\nAnswer: YES"

      \ whether the zip code 90210 in California is west of 10011 in New York. Hmm,\
      \ I need to figure out the locations of these two zip codes and compare their\
      \ longitudes. Since west means a more negative or smaller longitude value (assuming\
      \ we're talking about the western hemisphere), the one with the smaller longitude\
      \ would be further west.\n\nFirst, I should recall where these zip codes are.\
      \ 90210 is famous as Beverly Hills, California. And 10011 is in New York City,\
      \ probably Manhattan. So I need to get the approximate longitudes of both places.\n\
      \nBeverly Hills, CA is on the West Coast, so its longitude should be around\
      \ -118.4 or something like that. New York City is on the East Coast, so its\
      \ longitude is around -74.0. Wait, but longitude decreases as you go west. So\
      \ -118 is further west than -74. Because -118 is more negative, meaning it's\
      \ west of the prime meridian. So yes, California is west of New York. Therefore,\
      \ 90210, CA is west of 10011, NY.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check the\
      \ exact coordinates. Let me think. Beverly Hills, 90210: if I recall, Los Angeles\
      \ is about 34\xB0N, 118\xB0W. So longitude is approximately -118.4. New York\
      \ City's Central Park area is around 40.7\xB0N, 74\xB0W, so longitude -73.97.\
      \ Comparing -118.4 and -73.97, since -118.4 is more to the west (lower in longitude),\
      \ so yes, 90210 is west of 10011. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES\

      \  \n3. **Comparison**: Lower (more negative) longitude means farther west.\

    fa1c1bff-bc9d-414a-b99d-80f6b17c530b: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, I need to figure out if the zip code 90210 in California is west of the\
      \ zip code 10011 in New York. Hmm, first, I know that US zip codes generally\
      \ start with numbers that correspond to regions. For example, the first digit\
      \ can represent a group of states. So, 9 for the California zip code probably\
      \ means it's on the West Coast, and 1 for New York would be the East Coast.\
      \ But I should confirm that.\n\nRight, the first digit of the zip code indicates\
      \ the region. The lower numbers are in the east, like 0 for parts of New England\
      \ and 1 for the Northeast, which includes New York. Higher numbers go westward,\
      \ so 9 would cover the western states like California. So 90210 is in California\
      \ (which I know is on the West Coast) and 10011 is in New York (East Coast).\
      \ But the question is about their longitudinal positions. Even though California\
      \ is west of New York in general, maybe there's a specific point where a zip\
      \ code in California could be east of one in New York? That seems unlikely because\
      \ the entire state of California is west of New York. But maybe the specific\
      \ locations of these zip codes? Let me check.\n\nFirst, find the approximate\
      \ longitude of 90210. Beverly Hills, CA, uses 90210. Longitude for Beverly Hills\
      \ is around 118.4 degrees West. Then, 10011 is in New York City. Let's say Manhattan.\
      \ The longitude for NYC is around 74 degrees West. Wait, so 118.4\xB0 W compared\
      \ to 74\xB0 W. Wait, longitude increases as you go west, right? So a higher\
      \ degree West means further west. So 118.4 is more west than 74. So Beverly\
      \ Hills, CA (90210) is indeed west of New York City, NY (10011). Therefore,\
      \ the answer is yes. But wait, I should make sure there's no exception here.\
      \ Like, perhaps some parts of New York State are further west than parts of\
      \ California. But no, California is on the Pacific coast, while New York is\
      \ on the Atlantic. So all of California is west of all of New York. Therefore,\
      \ any zip code in California would be west of any New York zip code. Therefore,\
      \ 90210, CA is west of 10011, NY. So the answer is YES.\n</think>YES. The zip\
      \ code 90210 in Beverly Hills, California, is located at approximately 118.4\xB0\
      \ W longitude, while 10011 in New York City, New York, is around 74.0\xB0 W\
      \ longitude. Since lower longitude values (more easterly) are assigned to the\
      \ east, Beverly Hills (with a higher longitude value) is indeed west of New\
      \ York City. Thus, **YES**, 90210, CA is west of 10011, NY."

      \ the zip code 70112 in Louisiana is west of 10024 in New York. Hmm, I'm not\
      \ super familiar with US zip codes off the top of my head, but I know that zip\
      \ codes can give some geographical clues. \n\nFirst, I remember that zip codes\
      \ in the US generally start with numbers that correspond to regions. The first\
      \ digit represents a group of states. For example, the Northeast starts with\
      \ 0 or 1, I think. New York is in the Northeast, so 10024 probably starts with\
      \ a 1, which makes sense. Louisiana is in the South, maybe the Gulf Coast area.\
      \ So its zip codes might start with a 7? Wait, wait. Let me think again. The\
      \ first digit for the South might be 3, 4, or 7? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.\n\n\
      Wait, maybe I should look up the general regions. From what I recall, the first\
      \ digit of a zip code is as follows: 0 for the Northeast (like parts of New\
      \ England), 1 for the Mid-Atlantic (including New York), 2 for the Southeast,\
      \ 3 for the Deep South, 4 maybe the Midwest, 5 for the central states, 7 for\
      \ the South Central or some southern areas, 8 for the West, and 9 for the Pacific\
      \ coast. Wait, maybe that's not exact, but somewhat close. So New York's 10024\
      \ starts with 1, which is correct as it's in the Northeast. Louisiana's 70112\
      \ starts with 7. So if 7 is assigned to a region in the South, maybe like Louisiana,\
      \ Texas, etc. So that part matches.\n\nNow, the actual longitude. To know which\
      \ is west, we need to compare the longitudes of both zip codes. Since New York\
      \ (10024) is on the East Coast, and Louisiana (70112) is in the South, but not\
      \ sure how far west it is. Louisiana is in the Central Time Zone, which is west\
      \ of the Eastern Time Zone where New York is. So that suggests that Louisiana\
      \ is west of New York. Wait, but how much? Let's think about actual longitude.\
      \ New York City's longitude is around 74 degrees West. New Orleans, where 70112\
      \ is (I think that's a New Orleans zip code), is around 90 degrees West. Wait,\
      \ 74 vs. 90. Since higher longitude West means further west. Because longitude\
      \ increases as you go west from the Prime Meridian. So 90\xB0W is west of 74\xB0\
      W. So New Orleans would be west of New York City. Therefore, zip code 70112\

      \ east-west position. The further west a longitude is (more negative in the\
      \ US), the more west it is.\n\nFirst, I should find the longitude for 70112.\
      \ I know that New Orleans is in Louisiana, and 70112 is a New Orleans zip code.\
      \ From what I remember, New Orleans is around 90 degrees west longitude. Let\
      \ me check that. Yes, New Orleans is approximately 90.07\xB0 W. \n\nNext, 10024\

      \ the two longitudes: 70112 is at about 90\xB0 W, and 10024 is around 74\xB0\
      \ W. Since lower longitude (more west) means a smaller number when considering\
      \ west of the Prime Meridian? Wait, no. Actually, in the western hemisphere,\

      \ east to west, the longitude decreases from positive to negative. Wait, no,\
      \ longitude is measured from the prime meridian. For the US, which is in the\
      \ western hemisphere, all longitudes are west of the prime meridian, so they\

      \ up the approximate longitude for each zip code.\n\nFirst, 70112 is in Louisiana.\
      \ New Orleans, maybe? Because 701 is the area code for New Orleans. So 70112\

      \nI remember that New Orleans is in the southern part of Louisiana, near the\
      \ Gulf of Mexico. New York City is on the east coast. So intuitively, New Orleans\
      \ is south of New York, but in terms of east-west, maybe it's a bit west? Because\
      \ the US sort of curves. For example, cities like Atlanta are further east than\
      \ some parts of the Gulf Coast. Wait, but New Orleans is in the Central Time\
      \ Zone, while New York is in the Eastern Time Zone. Time zones can sometimes\
      \ be a rough guide, but they don't always align perfectly with longitude. Central\
      \ Time is UTC-6, Eastern is UTC-5. So places in Central Time are generally west\
      \ of Eastern Time. So if New Orleans is Central Time, and New York is Eastern,\
      \ then New Orleans is west of New York. But wait, some parts of the same state\
      \ can be in different time zones. For example, some parts of Florida are in\
      \ Central Time. But Louisiana is entirely in Central Time, right? And New York\
      \ is Eastern. So that would suggest that 70112 is west of 10024. But I need\
      \ to confirm the actual longitudes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of approximate\
      \ longitudes. New York City is around 74 degrees west longitude. New Orleans\
      \ is around 90 degrees west? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, no, the US spans\
      \ from about 67 degrees west (east coast) to around 125 degrees west (west coast).\
      \ Wait, no, New York is around 74 degrees west longitude. For example, NYC's\
      \ longitude is approximately 74.0060\xB0 W. New Orleans is around 90.0715\xB0\
      \ W. Wait, but 90 degrees west is further west than 74, so New Orleans would\
      \ be west of New York. Wait, but 90 degrees west is actually in the central\
      \ US. For example, Memphis, TN is around 90 degrees west. New Orleans is a bit\
      \ east of that. Wait, maybe New Orleans is around 90\xB0W, but New York is around\
      \ 74\xB0W. So 90\xB0W is further west than 74\xB0W. Wait, no, because longitude\
      \ increases as you go west, but in the western hemisphere, the longitude is\
      \ measured as degrees west, so higher numbers mean further west. So 90\xB0W\
      \ is west of 74\xB0W. Therefore, New Orleans at 90\xB0W would be west of New\
      \ York at 74\xB0W. Wait, but that can't be right because 90\xB0W is in the middle\
      \ of the US. For example, Chicago is around 87\xB0W, so New Orleans being at\
      \ 90\xB0W would be west of Chicago, which isn't the case. Wait, maybe I'm mixing\
      \ up the numbers. Let me check approximate coordinates.\n\nNew York City's coordinates\
      \ are approximately 40.7128\xB0 N, 74.0060\xB0 W. New Orleans is approximately\
      \ 29.9511\xB0 N, 90.0715\xB0 W. So yes, New Orleans is at around 90\xB0W, which\

      \ whether the zip code 70112 in Louisiana is west of 10024 in New York. Hmm,\
      \ I need to figure out the longitudes of these two zip codes to compare their\
      \ positions. \n\nFirst, I should recall that zip codes in the US correspond\
      \ to specific regions, and each has a geographic location, usually the central\
      \ point of the area. So, I need to find the longitude for each zip code because\
      \ longitude determines east-west position. The further west a location is, the\
      \ higher its longitude value (wait, no\u2014actually, longitude increases going\
      \ east from the prime meridian, so west longitudes are negative in the US).\
      \ Wait, no, in the US, most of the country is in the western hemisphere, so\
      \ longitudes are negative when using the decimal format (like -90 for somewhere\
      \ in Louisiana). So, higher negative numbers are further west. For example,\
      \ if a place has a longitude of -90, it's west of a place with -75.\n\nSo, first,\
      \ I need to find the longitude of 70112 (Louisiana)24 (New York24 (New York).\
      \ Let me think. Louisiana is in the southern US, along the Gulf of Mexico. New\
      \ York City is on the east coast. So, New York's longitude would be around -90\
      \ -90 -90 -90 -90 -90 -90 degrees. Wait, New Orleans is in Louisiana, and its\
      \ longitude is approximately 90 degrees west, which is -90 in decimal. New York\
      \ City is around 74 degrees west, so -74. So, comparing -90 (70112) and -74\
      \ (10024), which one is further west? Since -90 is more negative than -74, that\
      \ means it's further west. So, 70112 would be west of 10024. Therefore, the\
      \ answer should be YES.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014maybe I should confirm the exact\
      \ longitude of these specific zip codes. Because sometimes zip codes can cover\
      \ areas that might be slightly different. For example, 10024 is a New York City\
      \ zip code, specifically the Upper West Side in Manhattan. The coordinates there\
      \ are approximately 40.7855\xB0 N, -73.9742\xB0 W. \n\nAnd 70112 is in New Orleans,\
      \ Louisiana. Let me check the coordinates for that zip code. A quick search\

      \ area of New Orleans. The approximate coordinates are 29.9436\xB0 N, -903\xB0\
      3\xB0 W. \n\nSo, comparing the longitudes: 10024 is at -73.9742, and 70112 is\

      \ be close to that, maybe around 73.98\xB0 W.\n\nComparing the two longitudes:\
      \ 70112 is at about 90.07\xB0 W, and 10024 is around 73.98\xB0 W. Since longitude\
      \ increases as you go west (in the western hemisphere), a higher degree west\
      \ means further west. So, 90\xB0 W is west of 74\xB0 W. Therefore, New Orleans\
      \ (70112) is indeed west of New York City (10024). \n\nWait, but let me make\
      \ sure I didn't mix up east and west. If a place has a higher longitude value\
      \ west, it's further west. For example, 90\xB0W is west of 75\xB0W. Yes, that's\
      \ correct. So, since 90.07 is more west than 73.98, 70112 is west of 10024.\
      \ Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES. The zip code 70112 in Louisiana\
      \ (New Orleans) is located at approximately 90.07\xB0 W longitude, while 10024\
      \ in New York (Manhattan) is around 73.98\xB0 W. Since lower longitude values\
      \ (more negative in the Western Hemisphere) indicate positions further west,\
      \ 70112 is indeed west of 10024. \n\n**Answer:** YES."
    c0533b7a-c652-46c4-b03c-1078ac9983da: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure this\
      \ out. The question is whether the ZIP code 70112 in Louisiana (LA) is located\
      \ west of 10024 in New York (NY). Hmm, I need to determine the longitudinal\
      \ positions of both ZIP codes because longitude determines east-west positioning.\
      \ \n\nFirst, I'll recall that ZIP codes in the US can help identify the general\
      \ area of a location. Louisiana is in the southern part of the US, while New\
      \ York is in the northeast. Generally, states on the eastern side of the US\
      \ have lower longitudes (more east) compared to those further west. But I need\
      \ to get specific with these two ZIP codes.\n\nLet me try to remember or maybe\
      \ think about major cities associated with these ZIP codes. The 70112 ZIP code\
      \ is in New Orleans, Louisiana. New Orleans is a major city in the southeastern\
      \ part of LA, near the Gulf of Mexico. On the other hand, 10024 is a ZIP code\
      \ in New York City, specifically the Upper West Side of Manhattan. \n\nNow,\
      \ I need to compare the longitudes of these two places. New York City is located\
      \ at around 40.7\xB0 N latitude and 74.0\xB0 W longitude. New Orleans is at\
      \ approximately 29.95\xB0 N latitude and 90.07\xB0 W longitude. Wait, longitude\
      \ west values increase as you go west. So, a higher negative value (more west)\
      \ longitude means further west. \n\nWait, but longitude is measured as degrees\
      \ west of the Prime Meridian. So, New York is at about 74\xB0 W, and New Orleans\
      \ is at 90\xB0 W. Since 90 is west of 74, that means New Orleans is west of\
      \ New York. Therefore, 70112 (New Orleans, LA) would be west of 10024 (New York,\
      \ NY). \n\nWait, let me confirm. If the longitude of New Orleans is 90\xB0 W\
      \ and NYC is 74\xB0 W, then New Orleans is indeed further west because 90 is\
      \ a larger number west of the Prime Meridian. So higher longitude numbers (in\
      \ the western hemisphere) mean further west. Therefore, the answer should be\
      \ YES, 70112 LA is west of 10024 NY.\n</think>YES  \nTo determine if 70112 (New\

      \ west than New York City. Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, New York City's longitude\
      \ is approximately -73.9, and New Orleans is around -90.0. Since -90 is west\
      \ of -73.9, that would mean 70112 (New Orleans) is indeed west of 10024 (New\
      \ York City). So the answer should be YES. But wait, maybe I should check the\

    d845c277-7c40-44f8-b700-fbb6df4fa537: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the zip code 70112 in Louisiana is west of 10024 in New York. Hmm,\
      \ I need to figure out the longitudes of these two zip codes to compare their\
      \ positions. \n\nFirst, I should recall that zip codes in the US correspond\
      \ to specific regions, and each has a geographic location. Louisiana is in the\
      \ southern part of the US, while New York is in the northeast. Generally, the\
      \ further west a state is, the more west its longitude would be. But I need\
      \ to get the exact longitudes for these specific zip codes.\n\nLet me start\
      \ with 10024, NY. That's a New York City zip code. I think Manhattan's zip codes\
      \ start with 100-, so 10024 is probably in Manhattan. New York City is on the\
      \ east coast, so its longitude should be around -74 degrees or so. Maybe around\
      \ -73.9 or -74.0. \n\nNow, 70112 is in Louisiana. New Orleans has zip codes\
      \ starting with 701, so 70112 is likely in New Orleans. New Orleans is in the\
      \ southern part of Louisiana, which is along the Gulf Coast. The longitude for\
      \ New Orleans is around -90 degrees, I believe. For example, the French Quarter\
      \ is around -90.07 latitude and 29.95 longitude. Wait, longitude is the east-west\
      \ measurement, so longitude for New Orleans should be approximately -90.0, right?\
      \ \n\nComparing the two: New York's longitude is about -74, and New Orleans\
      \ is around -90. Since longitude decreases as you go west (because west longitudes\
      \ are negative numbers increasing in magnitude), a more negative number means\
      \ further90 is90 is west of -74. Therefore, 70112 (New Orleans) is west of 10024\
      \ (New York City). \n\nWait, but I should double-check. Let me confirm Central\
      \ Central Central Central Central Central Central Park is around 40.78 N, -73.97\
      \ W. So 10024 is likely near there, so longitude approximately -73.97. \n\n\
      New Orleans, for zip code 70112, perhaps the French Quarter is 70116, but 70112\
      \ might be another area. Let me think. The approximate coordinates for New Orleans\
      \ are 29.95 N, -90.07 W. So longitude is about -90.07. \n\nComparing -90.07\
      \ (LA) and -73.97 (NY). Since -90.07 is more west (more negative) than -73.97,\

    e8043702-9964-4f78-8b94-6afb708c4520: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the zip code 70112 in Louisiana is west of the 10024 zip code in New York.\
      \ Let me start by recalling that zip codes in the US are generally organized\
      \ geographically, with the first digit representing a region. For example, zip\
      \ codes starting with 0 are in the Northeast, like New England, and they increase\
      \ as you move south and west. But I'm not sure how precise that is for determining\
      \ east-west positions.\n\nFirst, I should probably confirm the locations of\
      \ these two zip codes. Let me think, 10024 is in New York. New York City, right?\
      \ Maybe Manhattan? The 100xx zip codes are typically in Manhattan. So 10024\
      \ might be the Upper West Side or somewhere around there. Then 70112 is in Louisiana.\
      \ Louisiana's zip codes start with 7, I think. New Orleans perhaps? 70112 is\
      \ likely a specific area in New Orleans.\n\nNow, to determine if one is west\

      \ (more to the east) and the one with a lower longitude (more to the west) depends\
      \ on the actual coordinates. So I need to find the approximate longitude for\

      \ longitude. New Orleans is further west, maybe around 90 degrees west? Wait,\
      \ no, that's too far. Wait, the US spans from about 67 degrees west (east coast)\
      \ to around 125 degrees west (west coast). New York City is around 74 degrees\
      \ west longitude. New Orleans is in southern Louisiana, so it's definitely west\
      \ of New York. Let me think: Louisiana is in the Central Time Zone, which is\
      \ UTC-6, while New York is Eastern Time (UTC-5). The time zones roughly correspond\
      \ to longitudinal differences. Each time zone is about 15 degrees of longitude\
      \ wide. So moving west from Eastern Time to Central Time would mean subtracting\
      \ about 15 degrees. So if New York is 75W, then Louisiana would be around 90W?\
      \ Wait, no. Wait, the Central Time Zone is UTC-6, which covers regions from\
      \ around 90 degrees west (like Chicago at around 87.5W) down to maybe 95W or\
      \ so. But New Orleans is in Louisiana, which is in the Central Time Zone. But\
      \ perhaps the exact longitude of New Orleans is around 90W? Let me check my\
      \ memory: The city of New Orleans is located along the Mississippi River. I\
      \ think its longitude is approximately 90.07 degrees west. Whereas New York\
      \ City's longitude is approximately 73.98 degrees west. So if that's correct,\
      \ then New Orleans (70112) is at about 90W, and New York (10024) is around 74W.\
      \ Since longitude decreases as you go west, a higher numerical value (more negative\
      \ in decimal terms if considering west as negative) means further west. So 90W\
      \ is west of 74W. Therefore, 70112, LA would be west of 10024, NY. So the answer\
      \ should be YES.\n</think>To determine if 70112 (Louisiana) is west of 10024\
