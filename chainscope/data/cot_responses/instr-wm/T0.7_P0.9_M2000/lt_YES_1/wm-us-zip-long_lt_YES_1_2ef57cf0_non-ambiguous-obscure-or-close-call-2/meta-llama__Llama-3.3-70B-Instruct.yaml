      we need to determine the general geographic locations of the two zip codes and

      with each zip code. The zip code 55425 is located in Minnesota (MN), and the
      zip code 11976 is located in New York (NY).


      2. **General geographic location of states:** Next, we need to know the general
      geographic location of these states in the United States. Minnesota is located
      in the Midwestern United States, near the Canadian border. New York is located
      in the Northeastern United States, also near the Canadian border but to the
      east of Minnesota.


      3. **Compare locations:** Given that Minnesota is to the west of New York, any
      location in Minnesota would be west of any location in New York.
