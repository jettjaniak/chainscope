      1. Napoleon Bonaparte was a French military leader and emperor who lived from
      1769 to 1821.


      2. Kofi Annan was a Ghanaian diplomat who served as UN Secretary-General from
      1997 to 2006, and lived from 1938 to 2018.


      3. Napoleon was born in 1769, which is well before Kofi Annan''s birth year
      of 1938.


      4. Since Napoleon was born 169 years before Kofi Annan, Napoleon was definitely
      born earlier.
