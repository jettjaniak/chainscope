    f371599b-32e9-4696-bfd7-d1d8f0ea3afc: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s find the release date of "Morning Has Broken" by Cat Stevens:

      - This song was originally released in 1971 on the album "Teaser and the Firecat"


      2. Next, let''s find the release date of "Bleeding Love" by Leona Lewis:
