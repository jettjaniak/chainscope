    5445eccf-9475-42dd-8f9c-7e0ec0388d2d: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, recall that zip codes are assigned roughly based on population density
      and geographic area.


      2. Lower zip code numbers in a given state/area typically indicate more densely
      populated urban centers.


      3. 10014 and 10011 are both in New York City, specifically in Manhattan.


      4. 10011 covers the Chelsea and West Village neighborhoods.


      5. 10014 covers the West Village and part of Greenwich Village.


      6. Both are in very dense, populated parts of Manhattan.


      7. However, 10014 has a slightly higher number, which might suggest it could
      be slightly less dense.


      8. But zip code numbers aren''t a precise population indicator, so we can''t
      definitively conclude population from the number alone.


      9. To know for certain, we would need actual population data for these specific
      zip codes.


      10. Without that precise data, I cannot confidently state whether 10014 is less
      populous than 10011.
