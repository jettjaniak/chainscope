      \n3. **Compare the longitudes of the two cities:**  \n   Longitude measures\
      \ how far east or west a location is. The higher the longitude value, the further\
      \ west the location.  \n   - The longitude of Philadelphia, PA, is approximately\
      \ **-75.1652\xB0**.  \n   - The longitude of Boston, MA, is approximately **-71.0589\xB0\
      **.  \n\n4. **Determine which location is further west:**  \n   Since **-75.1652\xB0\
      ** (Philadelphia) is a lower (more negative) number than **-71.0589\xB0** (Boston),\
      \ Philadelphia is further west than Boston.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**  \n   Therefore,\
