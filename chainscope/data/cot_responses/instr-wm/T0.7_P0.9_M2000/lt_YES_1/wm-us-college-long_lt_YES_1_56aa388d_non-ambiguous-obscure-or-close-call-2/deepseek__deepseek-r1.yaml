    0311b4fb-06f0-4953-8c9f-89f44bfee193: "<think>Okay, let's figure this out. The\
      \ question is whether the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) is\
      \ located west of Boston University in Massachusetts. \n\nFirst, I need to know\
      \ the locations of both universities. Boston University is in Boston, MA. UCSF\
      \ is in San Francisco, CA. Now, I should compare their geographical positions,\
      \ specifically their longitudes because east and west directions are determined\
      \ by longitude.\n\nI remember that in the United States, the eastern states\
      \ like Massachusetts are on the East Coast, so Boston would have a higher longitude\
      \ (more east) compared to California, which is on the West Coast. Wait, no.\
      \ Actually, longitude increases as you go east from the prime meridian. Since\
      \ the US is west of the prime meridian, all longitudes are west. But when comparing\
      \ positions within the US, San Francisco is further west than Boston. \n\nTo\
      \ confirm, let's think about the map. California is on the west coast, and Massachusetts\
      \ is on the east coast. So, any city in California, like San Francisco, should\
      \ be west of Boston. But maybe I should check the approximate longitudes. \n\
      \nBoston's longitude is around 71 degrees west. San Francisco's longitude is\
      \ approximately 122 degrees west. Wait, higher longitude west means further\
      \ west. So 122\xB0W is more west than 71\xB0W. Therefore, San Francisco is west\
      \ of Boston. Since UCSF is in San Francisco, it would be west of Boston University.\
      \ \n\nSo the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES. The University of California,\
      \ San Francisco (UCSF) is located in San Francisco, CA, which has a longitude\
      \ of approximately 122\xB0W, while Boston University is in Boston, MA, at around\
      \ 71\xB0W. Since lower numerical values (east being closer to 0\xB0) denote\
      \ more easterly locations, San Francisco's higher longitude (further west) confirms\
      \ UCSF is west of Boston University."
    08321dc5-5007-4cdc-ae42-5d3f735daea8: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) is located west\
      \ of Boston University in Massachusetts. Hmm, I need to figure out the geographical\
      \ locations of both universities and compare their longitudes. \n\nFirst, I\
      \ should recall where each university is. Boston University is in Boston, MA.\
      \ That's on the east coast of the United States. San Francisco is in California,\
      \ which is on the west coast. But wait, UCSF is specifically in San Francisco,\
      \ right? So San Francisco is a city in Northern California. \n\nNow, thinking\
      \ about the map of the US, the west coast is obviously to the west of the east\
      \ coast. But to be precise, I should check the longitudes. Places further west\
      \ have higher longitude values if we're using the convention where longitude\
      \ increases as you go west from the prime meridian, but actually, in the US,\
      \ longitude is measured west of the prime meridian, so it's negative degrees.\
      \ Wait, no, longitude east of the prime meridian is positive, and west is negative.\
      \ So for example, Boston is around 71 degrees west longitude, and San Francisco\
      \ is around 122 degrees west longitude. Wait, but since west longitude is negative,\
      \ Boston would be approximately -71, and San Francisco around -122. But when\
      \ comparing west longitudes, the more westward location has a more negative\
      \ value. So San Francisco, being further west, would have a longitude that's\
      \ more negative than Boston's. \n\nBut maybe I should get the exact coordinates.\
      \ Let me think. Boston University's coordinates: Boston is in Massachusetts,\
      \ and the approximate longitude is about 71 degrees west. San Francisco's longitude\
      \ is around 122 degrees west. Wait, but that can't be right because 122 degrees\
      \ west would be further west than, say, Los Angeles, which is around 118 degrees\
      \ west. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me correct that. San Francisco's\
      \ longitude is approximately 122 degrees west? Wait, no. Let me recall: The\
      \ prime meridian is 0, going east to 180 and west to -180. The US is in the\
      \ western hemisphere, so all longitudes are west, hence negative. For example,\
      \ New York is around -74 degrees, Boston is about -71 degrees. San Francisco\
      \ is around -122 degrees. Wait, that seems too far. Wait, no. Let me check:\
      \ Los Angeles is approximately 118 degrees west, which is -118. San Francisco\
      \ is a bit north of LA, so maybe around -122.5 longitude. Yes, I think that's\
      \ correct. So San Francisco is at approximately 37.7749\xB0 N latitude, 122.4194\xB0\
      \ W longitude. Boston University is in Boston, MA, which is at approximately\
      \ 42.3505\xB0 N, -71.1053\xB0 W. \n\nSo comparing the longitudes: Boston is\
      \ at -71.1053, and San Francisco is at -122.4194. Since longitude is measured\
      \ west, the more negative the value, the further west it is. So -122 is more\
      \ west than -71. Therefore, UCSF in San Francisco is indeed west of Boston University.\
      \ \n\nWait, but wait a second. If you have two points, the one with the more\
      \ negative (i.e., smaller) longitude is further west. For example, -120 is further\
      \ west than -70. So yes, San Francisco's longitude is more negative (smaller\
      \ number) than Boston's, so it's further west. Therefore, the answer should\

      \ (in the western hemisphere, longitude increases as you go west, but actually,\
      \ longitude is measured from 0\xB0 at the Prime Meridian, going east to 180\xB0\

      \ would be negative numbers when expressed in decimal degrees, like -71\xB0\
      \ for Boston and -122\xB0 for San Francisco). Wait, actually, more west means\
      \ more negative in decimal terms. So San Francisco would have a more negative\
      \ longitude than Boston, meaning it's further west.\n\nBut maybe I should check\
      \ approximate longitudes. Let me think. Boston is on the east coast. Its longitude\
      \ is roughly around 71 degrees west (so -71\xB0). San Francisco is in California,\
      \ which is much further west. San Francisco's longitude is about 122 degrees\
      \ west (-122\xB0). Since the more west you go, the higher the numerical value\
      \ in west longitude (but more negative in decimal), but when comparing east\
      \ vs. west, any point in California would be west of any point in Massachusetts.\
      \ Because the entire state of California is west of Massachusetts. The US stretches\
      \ from the Atlantic to the Pacific, with Massachusetts on the east and California\
      \ on the west. So any city in California would be west of any city in Massachusetts.\n\
      \nWait, but maybe someone might think, \"Is there any part of Massachusetts\

      \ be sure.\n\nLongitude measures how far east or west a location is. Places\
      \ with higher west longitude (more negative in the Western Hemisphere) are further\
      \ west. Let me recall that Boston's longitude is around 71 degrees west (but\

    83b539f6-d0c8-4599-b769-bf0d644800e4: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, we need to determine if the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)\
      \ is located west of Boston University in Massachusetts. \n\nFirst, I should\
      \ figure out the locations of both universities. Let's start with Boston University.\
      \ I know Boston is in Massachusetts, which is on the east coast of the United\
      \ States. Boston University's main campus is in Boston, MA. Now, where is UCSF?\
      \ The University of California, San Francisco is in San Francisco, California.\
      \ California is on the west coast. \n\nBut wait, I should verify the exact locations.\
      \ Let me think: Boston, MA is on the eastern side, while San Francisco, CA is\
      \ on the western side. So, just geographically, California is west of Massachusetts.\
      \ But longitude must be the key here. The further west the longitude, the more\
      \ west the location.\n\nI remember that the prime meridian is 0 degrees, and\
      \ longitude increases as you go west in the Western Hemisphere (but actually,\
      \ longitude west is measured from 0 to 180 degrees west). Wait, no, longitude\
      \ can be east or west. For the US, all locations are west of the prime meridian,\
      \ so they have west longitude values. So, a higher degree of west longitude\
      \ means further west. Wait, no, if you go west from the prime meridian, longitude\
      \ increases up to 180\xB0W. For example, New York is around 74\xB0W, and Los\
      \ Angeles is around 118\xB0W. So Los Angeles has a higher longitude in the west\
      \ direction, meaning it's further west.\n\nSo, Boston, MA: let me recall its\
      \ approximate longitude. Boston is on the east coast; maybe around 71 degrees\
      \ west longitude. San Francisco is in California, which is on the west coast,\
      \ so its longitude should be around 122 degrees west. Let me check that. Wait,\
      \ San Francisco's longitude is approximately 122.4\xB0W, and Boston's longitude\

      \ UCSF, being in San Francisco, would be west of Boston University, which is\
      \ in Boston. \n\nSo, the answer should be YES. But wait, just to be thorough,\
      \ maybe there's a trick here. Is there any chance that Boston University's campus\
      \ is in a different location? I don't think so. The main campus is in Boston,\

      \ of roughly 71.06\xB0W. Since lower numerical values in **west** longitude\
      \ indicate positions further east, San Francisco's higher west longitude (122.4\xB0\
      W vs. 71.06\xB0W) confirms it is west of Boston. Thus, UCSF is indeed west of\
      \ Boston University.  \n\nANSWER: YES"

      \ San Francisco is around -122 degrees. Wait, but lower numbers (more negative)\
      \ would mean further west. So San Francisco has a longitude of approximately\
      \ -122.4 degrees, and Boston is around -71.06 degrees. Since -122.4 is less\

      \ it's in the western hemisphere relative to the prime meridian. But when comparing\
      \ two places in the western hemisphere, the one with the higher longitude number\
      \ (more west) is further west. So yes, 122\xB0W is further west than 71\xB0\
      W. So UCSF is west of Boston University. \n\nI think that's right. Let me double-check\
      \ by maybe visualizing the US map. The west coast is definitely to the west\
      \ of the east coast. California is west of Massachusetts. So San Francisco is\
      \ west of Boston. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step\
      \ Explanation:**  \n1. **Locate the Cities:** Boston University is in Boston,\
      \ MA (east coast), while UC San Francisco is in San Francisco, CA (west coast).\
      \  \n2. **Compare Longitudes:** Boston\u2019s longitude is approximately 71\xB0\
      W, and San Francisco\u2019s is ~122\xB0W.  \n3. **Determine Direction:** Higher\
      \ west longitude (122\xB0W) means San Francisco is farther west than Boston\
      \ (71\xB0W). Thus, UC San Francisco is west of Boston University.  \n\n**Answer:**\

      \ whether the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) is located west\
      \ of Boston University in Massachusetts. Hmm, I need to figure out the geographic\
      \ locations of both universities and compare their longitudes. \n\nFirst, I\
      \ should recall where each university is. Boston University is in Boston, MA,\
      \ which is on the east coast of the United States. San Francisco, where UCSF\
      \ is located, is in California, on the west coast. But I need to be precise.\
      \ \n\nI know that the United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east\
      \ to the Pacific Ocean on the west. Boston is a major city in the northeast,\
      \ so its longitude would be in the eastern part. San Francisco is in northern\
      \ California, so its longitude would be much further west. \n\nBut to be accurate,\
      \ I should probably look up the approximate longitudes of both cities. Let me\
      \ think: Boston's longitude is around 71 degrees west, right? Because I remember\
      \ that the prime meridian is 0 degrees, and moving west into the Americas, the\
      \ longitude increases in the west direction. Wait, no, longitude west is measured\
      \ as degrees west of the prime meridian, so Boston is at about 71 degrees west\
      \ longitude. San Francisco, on the other hand, is around 122 degrees west longitude.\
      \ \n\nWait, no, actually, longitude for places in the US are west of the prime\
      \ meridian, so they are measured as negative degrees if using the convention\
      \ where east is positive. But sometimes they're just stated as degrees west.\
      \ For example, Boston is approximately 71\xB0W, and San Francisco is around\
      \ 122\xB0W. Since higher degrees west mean further west, San Francisco's longitude\
      \ is more west than Boston's. Therefore, UCSF would be west of Boston University.\n\
      \nBut let me double-check. If I think about the map, Boston is on the east coast,\
      \ and San Francisco is on the west coast. So moving from east to west across\
      \ the US, San Francisco is definitely west of Boston. So the answer should be\
      \ YES. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a trick here. Are there any exceptions? For\
      \ example, does Boston University have a campus somewhere else? No, I think\
      \ Boston University is solely in Boston, MA. And UCSF is in San Francisco, CA.\
      \ So their locations are as per their names. Therefore, since San Francisco\
      \ is west of Boston, UCSF is west of Boston University. So the answer is YES.\n\
      </think>The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) is located in San\
      \ Francisco, CA, which has a longitude of approximately 122\xB0W. Boston University\

    36473346-9883-426b-b71a-bdc116c03d1e: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the University of Michigan College of Engineering in Michigan is located west\
      \ of Duke University in North Carolina. Let me break this down step by step.\n\
      \nFirst, I should probably find the locations of both universities. The University\
      \ of Michigan's main campus is in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Duke University is in\
      \ Durham, North Carolina. Now, I need to determine their geographic positions\
      \ relative to each other, specifically their longitude, because longitude determines\
      \ east-west positioning.\n\nI remember that places with higher longitude values\
      \ are further west if we're talking about the eastern hemisphere, but in the\
      \ US, which is in the western hemisphere, the longitude values are west of the\
      \ prime meridian. So, the larger the longitude (more negative in some systems,\
      \ but in the US, it's typically stated as degrees west), the further west a\
      \ location is. Wait, actually, longitude is measured from 0\xB0 at the prime\
      \ meridian (Greenwich, UK) going east to 180\xB0 and west to -180\xB0. In the\
      \ US, all longitudes are west, so they would be negative when expressed in decimal\
      \ degrees, like -83 for Michigan and -78 for Duke. But when comparing, the more\
      \ western a location is, the more negative (lower) the longitude number. Wait,\
      \ no\u2014that's a common confusion. Let me think again. For example, New York\
      \ is around 74\xB0W, and Los Angeles is around 118\xB0W. So Los Angeles is further\
      \ west, and its longitude is a larger number when measured in degrees west (but\
      \ as a negative in decimal, like -118 vs -74). So, higher numerical value (more\
      \ west) means further west. Wait, no: if you consider longitude as positive\
      \ west, then 118\xB0W is 118, which is larger than 74\xB0W. But in decimal degrees,\
      \ west longitudes are negative. So, for example, New York is about -74\xB0,\
      \ and LA is -118\xB0. In that case, LA has a smaller longitude value (more negative)\
      \ than NY. But when comparing east-west positions, the one with the more negative\
      \ (smaller) longitude is further west. So, if Michigan's longitude is, say,\
      \ -83.7\xB0, and Duke's is -78.9\xB0, then Michigan (-83.7) is west of Duke\
      \ (-78.9) because -83.7 is less than -78.9. Wait, yes, because when you go west\
      \ from the prime meridian, the longitude becomes more negative. So a lower (more\
      \ negative) longitude means further west.\n\nSo, now I need to check the exact\
      \ longitudes. Let me recall or look them up mentally. Ann Arbor, MI: I think\
      \ it's approximately 83.7 degrees West, which would be -83.74 in decimal. Durham,\
      \ NC: Duke University is in Durham, which is around 78.9 degrees West, so -78.89.\
      \ Comparing those, -83.74 is more west than -78.89. So, yes, University of Michigan\
      \ (Ann Arbor) is west of Duke University (Durham). Therefore, the answer would\
      \ be YES. But wait, let me confirm the exact coordinates to make sure I'm not\
      \ mixing up anything. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the states: Michigan\
      \ is to the north and west of North Carolina. But geographically, Michigan's\
      \ lower peninsula is to the west of North Carolina? Let's visualize a map. North\
      \ Carolina is on the East Coast, south of Virginia. Michigan is in the Great\
      \ Lakes region. So, Michigan is northwest of North Carolina. So, yes, Ann Arbor,\
      \ MI would be west of Durham, NC. Therefore, the University of Michigan College\

      \ A higher longitude (more west) means a location is further west.\n\nLet me\
      \ recall: the United States uses negative longitudes for locations west of the\

      \ longitude. Wait, actually, in standard terms, locations in the western hemisphere\
      \ (like the US) have negative longitudes when using the decimal system where\
      \ east is positive. But sometimes people just refer to degrees west as positive.\
      \ Maybe I should look up the exact coordinates.\n\nAnn Arbor, MI: According\

      \ -83.74\xB0 W longitude. Durham, NC: I think it's around 35.99\xB0 N, -78.90\xB0\
      \ W. Wait, but longitude is measured from 0\xB0 (Prime Meridian) going west\
      \ to -180\xB0 and east to +180\xB0. So the more negative the longitude, the\

      \ each university is located. The University of Michigan's main campus is in\
      \ Ann Arbor, Michigan. The College of Engineering is part of that main campus,\
      \ so it's in Ann Arbor. Duke University is in Durham, North Carolina. So the\
      \ question is comparing the longitude of Ann Arbor, MI, and Durham, NC to see\
      \ which is further west.\n\nLongitude is the key here because west and east\
      \ are determined by how far a location is from the prime meridian. The more\
      \ west (lower longitude in the Western Hemisphere), the further west a place\
      \ is. Wait, actually, in the Americas, longitude is measured west from the prime\
      \ meridian (0\xB0), so higher longitude values would be further east, and lower\
      \ values further west. For example, the west coast of the US has a longitude\
      \ around 120\xB0W, while the east coast is around 75\xB0W. So a lower longitude\
      \ (closer to 0) is more east, higher (more negative in the Western Hemisphere)\
      \ would be further west? Wait, no. Wait, longitude in the Western Hemisphere\
      \ is measured as degrees west of the prime meridian, so it's expressed as negative\
      \ numbers. For example, New York is around 74\xB0W, which is -74 in decimal\
      \ degrees. So a larger negative number (like -120 for California) is further\
      \ west. So the lower the numerical value (more negative), the further west.\
      \ So comparing two longitudes, the one with the more negative (lower) value\
      \ is further west.\n\nSo I need to find the approximate longitude of Ann Arbor,\
      \ MI, and Durham, NC.\n\nLet me start with Ann Arbor. Michigan is in the Midwest,\
      \ and Ann Arbor is in the southeastern part of Michigan, near Detroit. Detroit's\
      \ longitude is around 83\xB0W (I think). Let me check that. Wait, from memory,\
      \ Detroit is roughly 83\xB0W. So Ann Arbor is just west of Detroit. Maybe around\
      \ 83.5\xB0W to 84\xB0W? Wait, maybe I should look up approximate coordinates.\
      \ Alternatively, I can think of other cities. Chicago is around 87.6\xB0W. So\
      \ if Detroit is 83\xB0W, then Ann Arbor, being west of Detroit, might be closer\
      \ to 84\xB0W. Wait, but actually, Ann Arbor is west of Detroit? Or east? Wait,\
      \ Detroit is on the eastern edge of Michigan, bordering Canada. So Ann Arbor\
      \ is west of Detroit. So Detroit is at about 83\xB0W, so Ann Arbor would be\
      \ a bit further west, maybe around 83.7\xB0W? Let's say approximately 83.7\xB0\
      W longitude.\n\nNow for Durham, NC. North Carolina is on the east coast. Durham\
      \ is in the central part of the state, near Raleigh. Raleigh's longitude is\
      \ around 78.6\xB0W. Durham is nearby, so perhaps around 78.9\xB0W? Wait, maybe\
      \ I'm mixing up. Let me think. If Durham is near Raleigh, which is the capital,\
      \ then Raleigh is at approximately 78.6\xB0W, so Durham might be slightly west\
      \ of that? Or east? Wait, I think Durham is west of Raleigh. Let me check. If\
      \ Raleigh is at 78.6\xB0W, and Durham is about 20 miles northwest of Raleigh,\
      \ then Durham's longitude might be around 78.9\xB0W. Wait, but I'm not sure.\
      \ Alternatively, maybe Duke University's coordinates are approximately 36.0\xB0\
      N, 78.9\xB0W. Let me confirm. Suppose Durham is around 78.9\xB0W.\n\nSo Ann\
      \ Arbor, MI is approximately 83.7\xB0W, and Durham, NC is approximately 78.9\xB0\
      W. Comparing these longitudes, since 83.7\xB0W is more west than 78.9\xB0W (because\
      \ 83.7 is a larger number west), that means Ann Arbor is further west than Durham.\
      \ Wait, but since longitude is measured in degrees west, a higher numerical\
      \ value (like 83.7 vs 78.9) means further west. So yes, University of Michigan\
      \ in Ann Arbor would be west of Duke University in Durham, NC.\n\nWait, but\
      \ wait\u2014if Durham is at 78.9\xB0W and Ann Arbor at 83.7\xB0W, then 83.7\
      \ is further west. Because each degree west increases as you go west. So yes,\

      \ I know Stanford is in California, right? Specifically, I think it's in the\
      \ northern part, near San Francisco. Maybe Palo Alto? Yeah, Palo Alto rings\
      \ a bell. That's in the Bay Area. Now, California is on the west coast of the\
      \ US, so that's pretty far west.\n\nThen there's Johns Hopkins University. The\
      \ question mentions Maryland, so Johns Hopkins is in Maryland. Where in Maryland?\
      \ I believe the main campus is in Baltimore. Maryland is on the east coast,\
      \ part of the Mid-Atlantic states. So, Baltimore is on the east side of the\
      \ US.\n\nNow, to determine if Stanford is west of Johns Hopkins, I need to compare\
      \ their longitudes. Places further west have higher longitude values if we're\
      \ using the convention that longitude increases as you go west, but wait, actually,\
      \ longitude is measured from the prime meridian, which is 0 degrees. Going west\
      \ from the prime meridian, longitude increases up to 180 degrees west, and east\
      \ increases up to 180 degrees east. But in the US, all longitudes are west,\
      \ so higher longitude numbers (more negative in the decimal system where west\
      \ is negative) would be further west. Wait, no, in the standard decimal system,\
      \ longitude for the US is negative because it's west of the prime meridian.\
      \ So, for example, California would have a more negative longitude than Maryland.\
      \ So, the more west you go in the US, the more negative the longitude becomes.\
      \ Wait, no, actually, longitude is measured as degrees west or east. But in\
      \ decimal terms, locations in the western hemisphere (like the US) are negative\
      \ when using the standard format where east is positive. So, for example, New\
      \ York might be around -74 degrees, and California around -122 degrees. So,\
      \ the more negative the longitude, the further west it is. So, if Stanford has\
      \ a longitude of, say, -122 degrees, and Johns Hopkins in Baltimore is around\
      \ -76 degrees, then Stanford is further west because -122 is less than -76.\
      \ Wait, but in terms of absolute direction, west is left on the map, so yes,\
      \ California is west of Maryland. \n\nBut maybe I should just think geographically.\
      \ The US map: Maryland is on the east coast, between Virginia and Pennsylvania.\
      \ California is on the west coast. So, any point in California is definitely\
      \ west of any point in Maryland. Because the entire state of California is west\
      \ of the entire state of Maryland. So, regardless of where exactly in each state\
      \ the universities are, Stanford in CA is west of Johns Hopkins in MD. \n\n\
      Wait, but could there be a case where a university in eastern California is\
      \ east of a university in western Maryland? Probably not, because California's\
      \ eastern border is still west of Maryland's western border. Let me visualize\
      \ the US map. The contiguous US states from west to east: California is on the\
      \ west coast, then you have Nevada, Utah, Colorado, etc., moving east. Maryland\
      \ is on the east coast, near the Atlantic. So, the entire state of Maryland\
      \ is east of the entire state of California. Therefore, any point in California\
      \ is west of any point in Maryland. \n\nTherefore, Stanford University, being\
      \ in California, is west of Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. So the answer\
      \ should be YES.\n</think>YES  \nStanford University is located in California,\
      \ which is on the West Coast of the United States, while Johns Hopkins University\

      W. So, if Stanford has a higher west longitude than Johns Hopkins, then it's\
      \ further west.\n\nSo, I need to find the approximate longitudes of both universities.\

      \ is approximately 37.7749\xB0 N, 122.4194\xB0 W. So Stanford, being in Palo\
      \ Alto, which is about 37.4295\xB0 N, 122.1621\xB0 W. So longitude is around\
      \ 122\xB0W.\n\nJohns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland. Baltimore's coordinates\
      \ are approximately 39.2904\xB0 N, 76.6122\xB0 W. So longitude is about 76.6\xB0\
      W.\n\nComparing the two: Stanford at ~122\xB0W vs. Johns Hopkins at ~76\xB0\
      W. Since 122 is a larger number than 76 in the west longitude, that means Stanford\
      \ is further west. Therefore, the answer should be YES, Stanford is west of\

      \ If a place has a higher degree in west longitude, it's further west. For example,\

      \ west, Stanford is indeed west of Johns Hopkins. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    a42e8502-71c3-4396-9df7-c45862c247da: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure this\
      \ out. The question is whether Stanford University in California is located\
      \ west of Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. Hmm, first, I need to know where\
      \ each university is located.\n\nSo, starting with Stanford University. I remember\
      \ that Stanford is in California, specifically in the northern part near San\
      \ Francisco. I think it's in Palo Alto or somewhere around there in the Bay\
      \ Area. California is on the west coast of the United States, so that's pretty\
      \ far west.\n\nNow, Johns Hopkins University is in Maryland. Maryland is on\
      \ the east coast, right? Like near Washington D.C., maybe in Baltimore? I think\
      \ Johns Hopkins' main campus is in Baltimore. So Maryland is one of the Mid-Atlantic\
      \ states, definitely on the eastern side of the US.\n\nNext, I need to compare\
      \ their longitudes. The further west a location is, the higher its longitude\
      \ value (in the Western Hemisphere, longitude is measured as west from the prime\
      \ meridian, so it's a negative number in the US). Wait, no, actually, in terms\
      \ of west longitude, higher numerical value (more west) would actually be a\
      \ more negative number if we're using the standard where the prime meridian\
      \ is 0, and moving west it goes to -180. So, for example, California has a more\
      \ negative longitude than Maryland.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms\
      \ of their actual longitudes. Let me recall or figure out approximate longitudes\
      \ for both. \n\nStanford University's coordinates: I think Palo Alto is around\
      \ 37.4\xB0 N latitude, 122.1\xB0 W longitude. So longitude is about 122 degrees\
      \ west.\n\nJohns Hopkins in Baltimore: Baltimore's coordinates are approximately\
      \ 39.3\xB0 N latitude, 76.6\xB0 W longitude. So longitude is around 76.6 degrees\
      \ west.\n\nComparing the two, Stanford is at 122\xB0W, and Johns Hopkins is\
      \ at 76.6\xB0W. Wait, but since longitude west is measured from 0 to 180 west,\
      \ the higher number means further west. So 122\xB0W is further west than 76.6\xB0\
      W. Therefore, Stanford, being at a more westerly longitude, is west of Johns\
      \ Hopkins.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm confused about east vs. west longitudes,\
      \ another way is to visualize the US map. California is on the west coast, Maryland\
      \ on the east coast. So any point in California is definitely west of Maryland.\
      \ Unless there's a specific location in Maryland that's further west, but Maryland\
      \ is a relatively small state on the east coast. The entire state is in the\
      \ Eastern Time Zone, while California is in the Pacific Time Zone. So the time\
      \ zones also indicate that California is west.\n\nTherefore, the answer should\
      \ be YES, Stanford University, CA is located west of Johns Hopkins University,\
      \ MD.\n</think>YES  \nStanford University in California (longitude approx. 122\xB0\
      W) is west of Johns Hopkins University in Maryland (longitude approx. 76.6\xB0\
      W). California's position on the Pacific coast and Maryland's location on the\
      \ East Coast confirm this directional relationship."

      \ Stanford University in California is west of Johns Hopkins University in Maryland.\
      \ I need to compare their geographic locations, specifically their longitudes\
      \ because west-east direction is determined by longitude.\n\nFirst, I should\
      \ recall where each university is located. Stanford is in California, which\
      \ is on the West Coast of the US. Johns Hopkins is in Maryland, which is on\
      \ the East Coast. But I need to be more precise since states can span multiple\
      \ longitudes.\n\nI think Stanford University is near Palo Alto, CA. Let me check\
      \ the approximate longitude for that. California's longitude ranges roughly\
      \ from about 114\xB0W to 124\xB0W, but specific cities might vary. For example,\
      \ Los Angeles is around 118\xB0W, and San Francisco is approximately 122\xB0\

      Johns Hopkins University is in Baltimore, Maryland. Maryland is on the East\

      \ comparing 122\xB0W (Stanford) to 76\xB0W (Johns Hopkins), the more westward\

    cd7d6811-a2a9-4297-94a3-2b8ef6a2f8cb: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ asking if Stanford University in California is located west of Johns Hopkins\
      \ University in Maryland. Hmm, I need to figure out the geographic locations\
      \ of both universities and then compare their longitudes to determine which\
      \ one is further west.\n\nFirst, I know that Stanford is in California, which\
      \ is on the west coast of the US. Johns Hopkins is in Maryland, which is on\
      \ the east coast. So generally, west coast states are further west than east\
      \ coast states. But I should check specific cities or locations to be sure.\n\
      \nStanford University's main campus is in Stanford, California. Let me think\
      \ where exactly that is. I recall it's near Palo Alto, which is in the San Francisco\
      \ Bay Area. So that's Northern California. Now, Johns Hopkins University's main\
      \ campus is in Baltimore, Maryland. Baltimore is on the eastern side of Maryland,\
      \ near the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nNow, to compare their longitudes. Since the Earth's\
      \ longitude lines run from north to south, with higher values going east and\
      \ west from the Prime Meridian. But in the US, all longitudes are west of the\
      \ Prime Meridian, so they are negative numbers. The more west a location is,\
      \ the more negative (lower) its longitude value. Wait, no, actually, in the\
      \ western hemisphere, longitude is measured as degrees west, so it's from 0\
      \ to 180 degrees West, but when expressed as a decimal, it's negative (e.g.,\
      \ 120\xB0W is -120 degrees). So, a place further west would have a smaller (more\
      \ negative) longitude value compared to a place further east. Wait, no, actually,\
      \ higher numerical value when considering negative numbers. For example, -80\
      \ is greater than -120. So, a location with longitude -122 (like San Francisco)\
      \ is further west than a location at -76 (like Baltimore). So, Stanford's longitude\
      \ would be more west (more negative) than Johns Hopkins', meaning Stanford is\
      \ west of Johns Hopkins.\n\nBut let me get exact coordinates. Let me recall:\
      \ Stanford University is at approximately 37.43\xB0 N latitude, 122.16\xB0 W\
      \ longitude. Johns Hopkins in Baltimore is around 39.33\xB0 N, 76.58\xB0 W.\
      \ Comparing the longitudes: Stanford is at 122.16\xB0W and Johns Hopkins at\
      \ 76.58\xB0W. Since 122.16\xB0W is further west than 76.58\xB0W (because 122\
      \ is a larger number west of the Prime Meridian), that means Stanford is indeed\
      \ west of Johns Hopkins. Yes, because the more west you go in the US, the higher\
      \ the longitude value in degrees west. Wait, wait, no. Wait, longitude increases\
      \ as you go east. Wait, no. Wait, longitude is measured from the Prime Meridian\
      \ (0\xB0), going east to 180\xB0E and west to 180\xB0W. So, in the US, which\
      \ is west of the Prime Meridian, all longitudes are in the west. So, for example,\
      \ New York is around 74\xB0W, Los Angeles is around 118\xB0W. The higher the\
      \ number in degrees west, the further west the location. So 118\xB0W is further\
      \ west than 74\xB0W. So Stanford at 122\xB0W is further west than Johns Hopkins\
      \ at 76\xB0W. Therefore, yes, Stanford is west of Johns Hopkins.\n</think>YES\
      \  \nStanford University in California (longitude ~122\xB0W) is located west\

      \ So a lower number (like 76\xB0W) is actually further east than a higher number\
      \ (like 122\xB0W). Because if you go west from the prime meridian, the longitude\

    408ebb33-7ff6-4e3e-abc4-1a9305feb8b6: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure out whether\
      \ the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in California is west of\
      \ the University of Chicago in Illinois.\n\nFirst, I need to know where each\
      \ of these schools is located. Caltech is in Pasadena, California. The University\
      \ of Chicago is in Chicago, Illinois. So I should compare their geographic locations,\
      \ specifically their longitudes because longitude determines east-west positioning.\n\
      \nI remember that in the United States, the further west a location is, the\
      \ higher its longitude value (in the Western Hemisphere, longitudes are negative,\
      \ so actually, a smaller negative number means more east, and a larger negative\
      \ number means more west. Wait, let me get that straight. Longitude is measured\
      \ from the prime meridian, which is 0 degrees. Going west from there, the longitude\
      \ becomes negative in the Western Hemisphere. So, for example, New York is around\
      \ -74 degrees, and Los Angeles is around -118 degrees. So the more negative\
      \ (lower) the longitude, the further west it is. So lower numbers (more negative)\
      \ mean more west, higher numbers (closer to zero) mean more east.\n\nSo, let's\
      \ find the longitudes of both cities. Pasadena, CA is part of the Los Angeles\
      \ area. I think Los Angeles is approximately at 118 degrees West longitude,\
      \ so that's -118 degrees. Chicago, Illinois is in the Midwest. Chicago's longitude\
      \ is around 87 degrees West, which is -87 degrees. Comparing -118 (Caltech)\
      \ and -87 (UChicago), since -118 is more negative (further west) than -87, that\
      \ means Caltech is west of Chicago. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>The\

      \ (more negative) than -87.6\xB0, Caltech is indeed located west of the University\
      \ of Chicago. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    4f24497b-093a-4fdb-8d2f-b18e253d2311: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user is asking if the California Institute of Technology (Caltech)\
      \ in California is located west of the College of the University of Chicago\
      \ in Illinois. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure out the locations of both\
      \ institutions.\n\nLet me start with Caltech. I know that Caltech is in Pasadena,\
      \ California. California is on the west coast of the United States. Now, the\
      \ University of Chicago is in Chicago, Illinois, which is in the Midwest. So,\
      \ I need to compare their longitudes because east and west positions are determined\
      \ by longitude. The further west a location is, the higher its longitude value\
      \ in the western hemisphere (since longitude increases as you go east, but west\
      \ longitudes are negative in some systems). Wait, actually, in the standard\
      \ longitude system, the prime meridian is 0\xB0, with longitudes increasing\
      \ eastward up to 180\xB0 and westward down to -180\xB0. So, places in the western\
      \ US would have more negative longitudes (if using the -180 to 180 system) or\
      \ higher values west of the prime meridian. \n\nWait, maybe I should just look\
      \ up the approximate longitudes. Let me recall: Chicago is around 41.8781\xB0\
      \ N latitude, 87.6298\xB0 W longitude. Caltech in Pasadena is approximately\
      \ 34.1478\xB0 N, 118.1445\xB0 W. So, comparing the longitudes: Chicago is about\
      \ 87.6\xB0 W, and Caltech is 118.1\xB0 W. Since longitude west is measured from\
      \ 0\xB0 to 180\xB0 west, the higher the number, the further west. So 118.1\xB0\
      \ W is further west than 87.6\xB0 W. Therefore, Caltech is indeed west of the\
      \ University of Chicago. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me confirm. If a location\
      \ has a more westerly longitude (i.e., a larger number when considering west\
      \ as positive), then yes. For example, Los Angeles is around 118\xB0 W, and\
      \ Chicago is around 88\xB0 W. So LA is further west. Therefore, Caltech (in\
      \ Pasadena, near LA) is west of Chicago. So the answer should be YES. \n\nBut\
      \ let me make sure I didn't mix up the directions. Sometimes people get confused\
      \ between east and west. If a place is west of another, its longitude is more\
      \ to the west, which in terms of numerical value (assuming west longitudes are\
      \ negative in a -180 to 180 system), a more negative number would be further\
      \ west. Wait, but in the decimal system, Chicago is at -87.6298 (since west\
      \ longitudes are negative), and Caltech is at -118.1445. Since -118 is more\
      \ negative than -87, that means it's further west. So yes, Caltech is west of\
      \ Chicago. \n\nTherefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine if Caltech\

      \ (Chicago, IL): ~87.6\xB0 W  \n\nSince 118.1\xB0 W is farther west than 87.6\xB0\

      \ New York is around 74\xB0W, Chicago is around 87\xB0W? Wait, no, maybe I have\
      \ that backwards. Let me think. The prime meridian is 0\xB0, going west, the\
      \ longitude is measured in degrees west, so Chicago is in the central time zone,\
      \ which is UTC-6, while California is Pacific time, UTC-8. But time zones are\
      \ rough indicators. \n\nAlternatively, I can recall that the approximate longitude\
      \ of Chicago is about 87.6\xB0 West. For example, the coordinates of the University\

      \ Caltech in Pasadena is around 34.14\xB0 N, 118.13\xB0 W. So comparing the\

    e40511b0-d6f9-49a1-9f98-7cb7aedb4525: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in California is located\
      \ west of the University of Chicago in Illinois. Let me start by recalling what\
      \ I know about these two institutions. \n\nFirst, Caltech is in Pasadena, California.\
      \ I remember that Pasadena is near Los Angeles, which is on the west coast of\
      \ the United States. On the other hand, the University of Chicago is in Chicago,\
      \ Illinois, which is a major city in the Midwest. \n\nNow, I need to compare\
      \ their longitudinal positions because longitude determines east-west placement.\
      \ The further west a location is, the higher its longitude value (in the Western\
      \ Hemisphere, since west longitudes are negative when using the standard -180\
      \ to 180 system). Wait, no, actually in terms of standard longitude measurements,\
      \ locations in the western part of the US have more negative longitude values.\
      \ For example, California is around -118 degrees, while Chicago is around -87.6\
      \ degrees. Wait, that's confusing. Let me make sure.\n\nLongitude is measured\
      \ from the prime meridian (0 degrees) in Greenwich, England. Moving west from\
      \ there, the longitude becomes negative up to -180 degrees. So cities in the\
      \ western US like Los Angeles have a longitude that's more negative (i.e., a\
      \ larger absolute value west) than cities in the Midwest like Chicago. So for\
      \ example, Los Angeles is approximately 118 degrees west, which is -118 degrees.\
      \ Chicago is around 87.6 degrees west, or -87.6 degrees. So since -118 is less\
      \ (more negative) than -87.6, that means Los Angeles (and thus Caltech in Pasadena)\
      \ is indeed west of Chicago.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check the exact\
      \ coordinates. Let me recall: Pasadena, CA is at approximately 34.1478\xB0 N,\
      \ 118.1445\xB0 W. The University of Chicago is located in Chicago, IL, which\
      \ is approximately 41.7897\xB0 N, 87.5997\xB0 W. So comparing the longitudes:\
      \ Caltech is at about 118.1445\xB0 W, and UChicago is at 87.5997\xB0 W. Since\
      \ 118.1445 is further west (higher in numerical value when considering west\
      \ as positive, but in terms of the decimal system, the more west you go, the\
      \ more negative the longitude is in the standard -180 to 180 system. Wait, no.\
      \ Wait, longitude can be expressed as either east or west. So 118 degrees West\
      \ is equivalent to -118 degrees. So when comparing degrees west, higher numbers\
      \ mean further west. So 118\xB0W is further west than 87\xB0W. Therefore, Caltech\
      \ is west of UChicago.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer is YES, because\

      \  \nCalifornia Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, CA, has a longitude\

      \ right? I remember that Nashville is the capital of Tennessee. And Virginia\
      \ Tech, I think that's in Blacksburg, Virginia. Okay, so now I need to compare\
      \ their geographic positions. \n\nLet me visualize a map of the United States.\
      \ Virginia is on the East Coast, right next to the Atlantic Ocean. Tennessee\
      \ is just west of North Carolina, which is south of Virginia. Wait, no, Tennessee\
      \ shares a border with Virginia? Let me check that. Actually, looking at the\
      \ map mentally, Tennessee is south of Kentucky and north of Mississippi, Alabama,\
      \ and Georgia. Virginia is to the east of Tennessee. So the western part of\
      \ Virginia might be near the border with Tennessee. \n\nWait, Virginia's western\
      \ border is with West Virginia and Kentucky, right? Because West Virginia split\
      \ off from Virginia during the Civil War. So Virginia's western border is touching\
      \ Kentucky. Then Tennessee is south of Kentucky. So Blacksburg, VA, which is\

      \ Virginia, and Nashville is in central Tennessee, which is west of the Tennessee-Virginia\
      \ border? Wait, Tennessee is to the west of Virginia. So if you go from Virginia\
      \ into Tennessee, you're moving west. Therefore, Nashville, being in Tennessee,\
      \ should be west of Blacksburg, Virginia. \n\nBut I should confirm the exact\
      \ longitudes. Latitude and longitude might give a precise answer. Let me recall\
      \ that longitude determines east-west position. The higher the longitude (more\
      \ west) if you're in the US. Wait, no, actually, the US is in the western hemisphere,\
      \ so longitude is measured west of the prime meridian. So cities in the eastern\
      \ US have lower longitude (more negative when west of the prime meridian). Wait,\
      \ maybe I should think in terms of actual coordinates. \n\nBlacksburg, VA: Let\
      \ me try to remember or estimate. I think that Virginia's longitude is around\
      \ -78 to -83 degrees maybe? Let's see, Washington, D.C. is around -77.0 longitude.\
      \ Richmond, VA is about -77.4. Blacksburg is further west in Virginia, so maybe\
      \ around -80.3 or something? Or perhaps even more west. Let me check mentally.\

      \ key here. Places with higher longitude numbers (more west) are further west.\
      \ Let me recall the approximate longitudes. \n\nNashville, TN: I think it's\
      \ around 86 degrees West longitude. Blacksburg, VA: I'm not exactly sure, but\
      \ Virginia is on the East Coast, further east than Tennessee. Maybe Blacksburg\
      \ is around 80 degrees West? Wait, Tennessee is west of Virginia as a state.\
      \ So if the entire state of Tennessee is west of Virginia, then Nashville should\

      \ So, we need to determine if Vanderbilt University in Tennessee is located\
      \ west of Virginia Tech in Virginia. Hmm, let's start by recalling where these\
      \ two states are. Tennessee is south of Kentucky and bordered by eight states,\
      \ including Virginia to the northeast. Wait, no, actually, Virginia is to the\
      \ east of Tennessee? Let me think. Tennessee's eastern border is with North\
      \ Carolina, right? And Virginia is north of North Carolina. So Virginia is northeast\
      \ of Tennessee.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the geographical locations more\
      \ precisely. Let me visualize a map. Virginia Tech is in Blacksburg, Virginia.\
      \ And Vanderbilt is in Nashville, Tennessee. So where are these cities exactly?\n\
      \nVirginia is on the East Coast, stretching from the Atlantic inland. Virginia\
      \ Tech's location, Blacksburg, is in the southwestern part of Virginia. Nashville,\
      \ Tennessee, is in the central part of Tennessee. Now, looking at the longitude.\
      \ Longitude determines east-west position. The more west the longitude (higher\
      \ negative number in the western hemisphere), the further west it is.\n\nSo\
      \ I need to find the longitude coordinates of both cities. Let's see. Blacksburg,\
      \ VA: I think its longitude is around -80.4 degrees. Nashville, TN: I believe\
      \ that's around -86.8 degrees. Wait, but longitude lines decrease as you go\
      \ west. So a more negative longitude means further west. So if Nashville is\
      \ at -86.8 and Blacksburg is at -80.4, then Nashville is west of Blacksburg.\
      \ So yes, Vanderbilt (Nashville) would be west of Virginia Tech (Blacksburg).\
      \ \n\nWait, let me confirm those longitudes. Maybe I'm mixing up the numbers.\
      \ For Blacksburg, VA: Coordinates are approximately 37.2296\xB0 N, 80.4139\xB0\
      \ W. So longitude is -80.4139. For Nashville, TN: 36.1627\xB0 N, 86.7816\xB0\
      \ W. So longitude is -86.7816. Comparing the two, -86.7816 is more west than\
      \ -80.4139. Because in terms of absolute values, 86 is larger than 80, but since\
      \ they're west longitudes, the more negative number is further west. So yes,\

      \ be further east, and the one with the lower longitude (more to the west) would\
      \ be further west. \n\nWait, but actually, in terms of longitude, the further\
      \ west a place is, the lower (more negative if in the western hemisphere) its\
      \ longitude. Since both Tennessee and Virginia are in the eastern part of the\
      \ US, let me look up their exact coordinates.\n\nLet me recall: Nashville, TN\

      \ longitude is approximately -86.8 degrees. If that's the case, then -86.8 is\
      \ more west than -80.4, which would mean Nashville (Vanderbilt) is west of Blacksburg\

      \ the approximate longitudes. I think Nashville, TN is around 86.8\xB0 West.\
      \ And Blacksburg, VA is somewhere like 80.4\xB0 West. Wait, wait, that can't\
      \ be right. Because 80.4\xB0W would be like around West Virginia or maybe eastern\

      \ right? So maybe its longitude is more like 78.4\xB0W? Let me think. For example,\
      \ Roanoke, VA is around 79.9\xB0W, and Blacksburg is a bit west of there. Maybe\
      \ around 80.4\xB0W? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall that the longitude\
      \ for Blacksburg, VA is approximately 80.4 degrees West. Wait, wait, no. Let\
      \ me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the relative\
      \ positions. Tennessee is to the west of Virginia, right? Because looking at\
      \ a US map, Virginia is on the East Coast, and Tennessee is west of Virginia,\
      \ bordering North Carolina to the south. Wait, no, Tennessee is directly south\
      \ of Kentucky and north of Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. Wait, Virginia\
      \ is east of Tennessee? No. Let me visualize the map. Virginia is along the\
      \ Atlantic coast, and Tennessee is to the southwest of Virginia. For example,\
      \ North Carolina is south of Virginia, and Tennessee is west of North Carolina.\
      \ So Tennessee is west of Virginia, but maybe not directly west; it's more southwest.\
      \ But in terms of east-west, is the entirety of Tennessee west of Virginia?\
      \ Probably not, because Virginia stretches quite far west. The western part\
      \ of Virginia is the panhandle, which borders West Virginia and Kentucky. So,\
      \ for example, the city of Bristol is in both Virginia and Tennessee. So there's\
      \ a point where Virginia and Tennessee meet. So depending on where exactly the\
      \ universities are, one could be west or east.\n\nBut Vanderbilt is in Nashville,\
      \ which is in central Tennessee. Virginia Tech is in Blacksburg, which is in\
      \ southwestern Virginia. So I need to compare the longitudes of these two cities.\
      \ Let me look up the approximate coordinates. If I recall, Nashville, TN is\
      \ around 36.1627\xB0 N, 86.7816\xB0 W. Blacksburg, VA is approximately 37.2296\xB0\
      \ N, 80.4139\xB0 W. Wait, so Blacksburg's longitude is 80.41\xB0W and Nashville's\
      \ is 86.78\xB0W. Since longitude west is measured as negative degrees, a higher\
      \ numerical value (more west) would mean a lower longitude. Wait, no. Wait,\
      \ longitude is measured from 0\xB0 at the prime meridian (Greenwich) and increases\
      \ going west up to 180\xB0W, which is the same as 180\xB0E. So, in the US, all\
      \ longitudes are west, so they are in the range of about 67\xB0W (east coast)\
      \ to 125\xB0W (west coast). So, a higher degree value in the west direction\
      \ means a location is further west. So, for example, a longitude of 80\xB0W\
      \ is east of 86\xB0W. So if Nashville is at 86.78\xB0W and Blacksburg is at\
      \ 80.41\xB0W, then Nashville is further west because 86.78 is a larger number\

      \ out where exactly each of these universities is located.\n\nStarting with\
      \ Vanderbilt University. I know Vanderbilt is in Nashville, Tennessee. Let me\
      \ confirm that... Yes, Vanderbilt's main campus is in Nashville, TN. Now, Virginia\
      \ Tech\u2014Virginia Tech is a public university in Blacksburg, Virginia. So\
      \ Virginia Tech is in Blacksburg, VA.\n\nNext, I need to compare their geographic\
      \ locations, specifically their longitude because the question is about east-west\
      \ positioning. Places with higher longitude (more west) have a higher numerical\
      \ value in the west-east direction. Wait, no\u2014longitude increases going\
      \ east from the prime meridian. So actually, a location with a higher longitude\
      \ would be further east, not west. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think\
      \ again. The prime meridian is 0 degrees, and as you go west from there into\
      \ the Americas, the longitude becomes negative (in the western hemisphere).\
      \ For the United States, all longitudes are west of the prime meridian, so they\
      \ are negative values. So a more westerly location would have a more negative\
      \ (lower) longitude. For example, California has a longitude around -120, while\
      \ New York is around -74. So, California is west of New York. So the key is\
      \ to compare the longitudes of the two universities: whichever has a more negative\
      \ (smaller) longitude is further west.\n\nNow I need to find the exact longitudes\
      \ of Nashville, TN and Blacksburg, VA. Let me recall or estimate. Nashville\
      \ is in central Tennessee. Blacksburg is in southwestern Virginia, near the\
      \ border with West Virginia. Let me visualize a map. Tennessee is west of Virginia,\
      \ so Tennessee as a state is west of Virginia. But Blacksburg is in the southwestern\
      \ part of Virginia, so maybe it's closer to the Tennessee border? But Nashville\
      \ is in the middle of Tennessee. So perhaps Nashville is west of Blacksburg.\
      \ But I should confirm with coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think\
      \ of the approximate positions. Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA: the coordinates\
      \ are approximately 37.2296\xB0 N, 80.4139\xB0 W. Vanderbilt in Nashville, TN:\
      \ approximately 36.1447\xB0 N, 86.8027\xB0 W. Wait, let me check those numbers.\
      \ If I recall, Nashville's longitude is around 86.8\xB0 W, and Blacksburg is\
      \ around 80.4\xB0 W. Since longitude west is measured as negative numbers, but\
      \ in terms of absolute degrees, the higher the number, the further west. Wait,\
      \ but in terms of numerical value (since they're both west, so negative), a\
      \ longitude of -86.8 (Nashville) is more negative than -80.4 (Blacksburg). So\
      \ Nashville's longitude is -86.8, Blacksburg's is -80.4. Since -86.8 is less\
      \ than -80.4, that means Nashville is west of Blacksburg. Therefore, Vanderbilt\
      \ University in Nashville is west of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. So the answer\
      \ would be YES.\n</think>To determine if Vanderbilt University (TN) is west\
      \ of Virginia Tech (VA):  \n1. **Locations**: Vanderbilt is in Nashville, TN;\

    fe77043a-eb58-4ec2-9869-5a145be5686b: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Vanderbilt University in Tennessee is located west of Virginia Tech\
      \ in Virginia. I need to figure out the answer step by step.\n\nFirst, I should\
      \ probably find the locations of both universities. Vanderbilt is in Tennessee,\
      \ and Virginia Tech is in Virginia. Now, I need to determine their geographical\
      \ positions relative to each other, specifically their longitude, since longitude\
      \ determines east-west positioning.\n\nI know that states to the west have lower\
      \ longitudes if we're talking about the US, but wait, actually, longitude increases\
      \ as you go east. So a place further west would have a lower longitude (more\
      \ negative if using the western hemisphere's standard). Let me confirm that.\
      \ For example, California is west of Texas, so California has a more negative\
      \ longitude.\n\nSo, I need to find the longitudes of both universities. Let\
      \ me recall or approximate. Virginia Tech is in Blacksburg, VA. Vanderbilt is\
      \ in Nashville, TN. \n\nBlacksburg, VA: I think it's in the western part of\
      \ Virginia, but still within the state. Virginia's longitude ranges approximately\
      \ from -75 to -83 degrees. Blacksburg being in the southwest, maybe around -80\
      \ degrees. Wait, actually, Virginia's western border is around -83 degrees.\
      \ Let me check mentally. The westernmost point of Virginia is near the border\
      \ with Kentucky, which is around -82.5 degrees. So Blacksburg, being in the\
      \ southwestern part, maybe around -80.4 degrees longitude? I might be off here.\
      \ Alternatively, I remember that Roanoke, VA is around -79.9, and Blacksburg\
      \ is a bit west of Roanoke. Maybe around -80.4?\n\nNashville, TN: Tennessee\
      \ is west of Virginia. Nashville is in middle Tennessee. The longitude for Nashville\
      \ is approximately -86.8 degrees. So if Blacksburg is around -80.4, and Nashville\
      \ is -86.8, then Nashville is further west (since -86.8 is more negative than\
      \ -80.4). Therefore, Vanderbilt would be west of Virginia Tech.\n\nWait, but\
      \ let me make sure. Maybe I should think about the states. Tennessee is directly\
      \ west of Virginia? No, actually, Tennessee is southwest of Virginia. But in\
      \ terms of longitude, the western border of Virginia is around 82.5 degrees\
      \ west, and Tennessee starts at around 81.7 degrees west (eastern border). Wait,\
      \ no\u2014that's getting confusing. Maybe better to think in terms of cities.\
      \ For example, Knoxville, TN is in eastern Tennessee, which is at around -83.9\
      \ longitude. Blacksburg, VA is around -80.4. So Knoxville is at a more western\
      \ longitude (more negative) than Blacksburg. But Nashville is even further west\
      \ than Knoxville. So yes, Nashville is further west. Thus, Vanderbilt in Nashville\
      \ would be west of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA.\n\nAlternatively, if I recall\
      \ that the Mississippi River is at about 90 degrees west, so Tennessee is east\
      \ of that, but still, Nashville is around -86.8, which is definitely west of\
      \ -80. So yes, Vanderbilt is west of Virginia Tech.\n</think>Vanderbilt University\
      \ is located in Nashville, Tennessee, while Virginia Tech is in Blacksburg,\
      \ Virginia. Comparing their longitudes: Nashville, TN is approximately 86.8\xB0\
      W, and Blacksburg, VA is approximately 80.4\xB0W. Since a lower (more westward)\
      \ longitude value indicates a location further west, **Nashville (Vanderbilt)\
      \ is west of Blacksburg (Virginia Tech)**. \n\nANSWER: YES"

      \ whether Northwestern University in Illinois is located west of the University\
      \ of Georgia in Georgia. Hmm, I need to figure out the longitudes of both places\
      \ because longitude determines east-west positioning. \n\nFirst, I should recall\
      \ where these universities are. Northwestern University is in Evanston, Illinois,\
      \ which is a suburb just north of Chicago. The University of Georgia is in Athens,\
      \ Georgia. \n\nNow, I need to find the longitude coordinates for both cities.\
      \ For Evanston, IL, I think Chicago is around 87\xB0 West longitude. Let me\
      \ check that. Wait, Chicago's coordinates are approximately 41.8781\xB0 N latitude\
      \ and 87.6298\xB0 W longitude. Since Evanston is just north of Chicago, its\
      \ longitude should be very close, maybe around 87.7\xB0 W.\n\nThen, Athens,\
      \ GA. The University of Georgia is there. Athens is in northeastern Georgia.\
      \ I believe Atlanta is around 84.3880\xB0 W. Athens is east of Atlanta, so its\
      \ longitude should be a bit more east, which would mean a smaller number in\
      \ west longitude. Let me confirm. Looking it up, Athens, GA has coordinates\
      \ approximately 33.9519\xB0 N, 83.3576\xB0 W. So that's around 83.36\xB0 W longitude.\n\
      \nComparing the two: Evanston, IL is at about 87.7\xB0 W, and Athens, GA is\
      \ at 83.36\xB0 W. Since longitude increases as you go west, a higher west longitude\
      \ value means further west. So 87.7\xB0 W is west of 83.36\xB0 W. Therefore,\
      \ Northwestern University in Illinois is indeed west of the University of Georgia\

      \ increases the west longitude, but the actual direction on the map\u2014if\

    18047181-1512-4549-8e95-c5c651b75f3c: "<think>Okay, let me figure out if Northwestern\
      \ University in Illinois is located west of the University of Georgia in Georgia.\
      \ \n\nFirst, I need to recall the geographic locations of both states. Illinois\
      \ is in the Midwest, right? Chicago is a major city there. Georgia, on the other\
      \ hand, is in the southeastern part of the US. So, the first thought is that\
      \ Illinois might be more to the north and west compared to Georgia.\n\nBut wait,\
      \ states can have varying longitudes. For example, even though Georgia is in\
      \ the southeast, maybe parts of Illinois are further east than parts of Georgia?\
      \ Hmm. I should check the longitude coordinates of both universities.\n\nNorthwestern\
      \ University is in Evanston, Illinois, which is a suburb just north of Chicago.\
      \ Let me recall that Chicago's longitude is around 87.6\xB0 West. So Evanston\
      \ would be around that area, maybe 87.7\xB0W or so.\n\nThe University of Georgia\
      \ is in Athens, Georgia. What's the longitude there? I think Athens is northeast\
      \ of Atlanta. Atlanta's longitude is about 84.4\xB0W. So maybe Athens is a bit\
      \ further east, like 83.4\xB0W or something close? Wait, no, Atlanta is at 84.4\xB0\
      W, and Athens is to the east of Atlanta. So if you go east from Atlanta, the\
      \ longitude decreases (since west longitude is measured as degrees west from\
      \ the prime meridian). So Athens would be, say, 83.3\xB0W? Let me double-check\
      \ that. For example, Athens, GA's coordinates are approximately 33.95\xB0 N,\
      \ 83.37\xB0 W. So 83.37\xB0W.\n\nMeanwhile, Evanston, IL is at 42.05\xB0 N,\
      \ 87.69\xB0 W. So comparing the longitudes: Northwestern is at 87.69\xB0W, UGA\
      \ is at 83.37\xB0W. Since longitude west values increase as you go west, a higher\
      \ number means further west. So 87.69 is west of 83.37. Therefore, Northwestern\
      \ in IL is indeed west of UGA in GA.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake with\
      \ the direction. Let me confirm: longitude lines run north-south, but measure\
      \ east-west position. The prime meridian is 0\xB0, and as you go west from there,\
      \ the longitude increases up to 180\xB0W. So, for example, New York is around\
      \ 74\xB0W, and Los Angeles is around 118\xB0W. So higher numbers are further\
      \ west. Therefore, 87.69\xB0W is west of 83.37\xB0W. So that means Northwestern\
      \ (87.69) is west of UGA (83.37). So the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step\
      \ Explanation:**  \n1. **Locations**: Northwestern University is in Evanston,\
      \ IL (longitude ~87.69\xB0W), while the University of Georgia (UGA) is in Athens,\
      \ GA (longitude ~83.37\xB0W).  \n2. **Longitude Comparison**: Higher west longitude\
      \ values indicate a location further west.  \n3. **Conclusion**: Since 87.69\xB0\
      W (Northwestern) is greater than 83.37\xB0W (UGA), Northwestern University is\
      \ indeed located west of the University of Georgia.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    1c21facf-2074-4202-b99a-c4b11485d3b5: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Northwestern University in Illinois is located west of the University\
      \ of Georgia in Georgia. I need to figure out the approximate longitudes of\
      \ both institutions to determine which one is further west.\n\nFirst, I'll start\
      \ by recalling that longitude measures east-west position. The higher the longitude\
      \ (in the western hemisphere), the further west a location is. But wait, in\
      \ the US, all longitudes are west of the Prime Meridian, so they're all negative\
      \ when expressed in decimal degrees. For example, Chicago is around -87.6, and\
      \ Atlanta might be around -84.3. Wait, actually, the more negative the longitude,\
      \ the further west it is because you're moving left on the map (westward) from\
      \ the Prime Meridian.\n\nSo Northwestern University is in Evanston, Illinois,\
      \ which is just north of Chicago. The University of Georgia is in Athens, Georgia.\
      \ Let me get the exact coordinates or at least approximate longitudes.\n\nI\
      \ remember that Chicago, IL is around 41.8781\xB0 N, 87.6298\xB0 W. Evanston\
      \ is nearby, so maybe similar longitude. Let's check that. Northwestern's main\
      \ campus in Evanston would have a longitude close to Chicago's, maybe around\
      \ -87.7.\n\nUniversity of Georgia in Athens, GA. Athens is northeast of Atlanta.\
      \ Atlanta's coordinates are about 33.7490\xB0 N, 84.3880\xB0 W. Athens might\
      \ be a bit east of Atlanta? Wait, but actually, Atlanta is in the northwest\
      \ part of Georgia. Athens is to the east of Atlanta. Wait, no, wait: If you\
      \ look at a map, Atlanta is in the north-central part of Georgia. Athens is\
      \ to the east-northeast of Atlanta. So if Atlanta is around 84.38\xB0 W, then\
      \ Athens might be slightly further east (which would mean a less negative longitude)\
      \ or west? Hmm, maybe I need to check specific coordinates.\n\nLooking up University\
      \ of Georgia's coordinates: The University of Georgia is in Athens, GA. Let\
      \ me recall or estimate. Athens is about 70 miles east of Atlanta. Since Atlanta\
      \ is at approximately 84.4\xB0 W, moving east would make the longitude less\
      \ negative. For each degree of longitude, the distance is about 69 miles (at\
      \ the equator, less as you go north). But since both are in similar latitudes,\
      \ maybe around 33-34\xB0 N. So moving 70 miles east from Atlanta would be roughly\
      \ a change in longitude. Let me calculate: 1 degree \u2248 69 miles * cos(latitude).\
      \ Latitude for Atlanta is ~33.75\xB0, so cos(33.75) \u2248 0.83. So 1 degree\
      \ \u2248 69 * 0.83 \u2248 57 miles per degree. So 70 miles east would be 70\
      \ / 57 \u2248 1.23 degrees. So if Atlanta is 84.388\xB0 W, then moving east\
      \ 1.23 degrees would take it to 84.388 - 1.23 = 83.158\xB0 W. Wait, but longitude\
      \ west is negative, so adding eastward (decreasing the numerical value, since\
      \ W is negative). So perhaps the University of Georgia (Athens) is around 83.37\xB0\
      \ W? I might be off here. Alternatively, maybe I should look up the actual coordinates.\n\
      \nBut since I can't look things up, I'll have to go by memory. Another approach:\
      \ Major cities in Georgia. Savannah is on the coast, which is further east.\
      \ Athens is inland, but still east of Atlanta. So if Atlanta is ~84.4\xB0 W,\
      \ then Athens is maybe ~83.3\xB0 W. So 83.3\xB0 W longitude.\n\nNorthwestern\
      \ University in Evanston, IL: Chicago is at 87.6298\xB0 W, so Evanston is just\
      \ north of there, so longitude is approximately 87.7\xB0 W. Since 87.7\xB0 W\
      \ is more west (more negative) than 83.3\xB0 W, Northwestern would indeed be\

      Now, to determine if Northwestern is west of UGA, I need to compare their longitudes.\

    9dd11def-94cc-4047-b83b-0bac808dc9da: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Northwestern University in Illinois of Georgia in of Georgia in of\
      \ Georgia in Georgia. Hmm, I need to figure out the geographic locations of\
      \ both universities and compare their longitudes. \n\nFirst, I should recall\
      \ where each university is situated. Northwestern University is in Illinois,\
      \ right? Specifically, I think it's in Evanston, which is a suburb just north\
      \ of Chicago. So Chicago is in the northeastern part of Illinois, near Lake\
      \ Michigan. That would place Northwestern in the northern part of Illinois,\
      \ near the eastern border of the state since Lake Michigan is to the east.\n\
      \nOn the other hand, the University of Georgia is in Athens, Georgia. Georgia\
      \ is a state in the southeastern United States. Athens is northeast of Atlanta,\
      \ the capital of Georgia. So, Athens is in the northern part of Georgia, but\
      \ still in the southeastern US region.\n\nNow, to determine which is further\
      \ west, I need to look at the longitude. Places with a higher longitude (more\
      \ west) have a more negative value if we're using the convention that west longitude\
      \ is negative. Wait, no, longitude is measured from the prime meridian, with\
      \ degrees west being negative and east being positive, but when comparing west/east\
      \ positions in the US, all locations are west of the prime meridian, so their\
      \ longitudes are negative. The further west a place is, the more negative (lower)\
      \ the longitude. Wait, no, actually, longitude increases as you go east. So,\
      \ for example, the US is in the western hemisphere, so longitude is measured\
      \ as west, which is negative. But when comparing two places in the US, the one\
      \ with a more westerly (further west) location would have a longitude that's\
      \ more to the west, which would be a lower numerical value if we're considering\
      \ negative numbers. For example, California is west of Texas, so California's\
      \ longitude is more negative (like -120) compared to Texas's -100. So, the more\
      \ west you go, the more negative the longitude becomes.\n\nSo, I need to find\
      \ the longitude of Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, and the University\
      \ of Georgia in Athens, GA. Let me try to recall approximate longitudes. Chicago\
      \ is around 87.6\xB0 W. Evanston is just north of Chicago, so probably similar\
      \ longitude, maybe 87.7\xB0 W. Athens, GA, I think Atlanta.3.3\xB0 W. Since\
      \ Athens is northeast of Atlanta, maybe its longitude is a bit east of Atlanta?\
      \ Wait, northeast would mean moving both north and east. So if Atlanta is at\
      \ 84.3\xB0 W, moving east would decrease the longitude (since east is towards\
      \ lower negative numbers). Wait, longitude west is negative, so moving east\
      \ would make the longitude less negative, i.e., higher numerical value. For\
      \ example, moving from 84.3\xB0 W (which is -84.3) eastward would go to -84.0,\
      \ -83.5, etc. So Athens, being northeast of Atlanta, might be around 83.3\xB0\
      \ W? Let me check approximate coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think\
      \ of major cities. Chicago is at about 87.6\xB0 W. Atlanta is at about 84.3\xB0\
      \ W. So Chicago is west of Atlanta. Since Evanston is near Chicago, it's around\
      \ 87.7\xB0 W. Athens, GA, being east of Atlanta, would be around 83.3\xB0 W.\
      \ Therefore, Northwestern (87.7\xB0 W) is west of UGA (83.3\xB0 W). Wait, but\
      \ wait, longitude west is measured as negative, so 87.7\xB0 W is -87.7, and\
      \ 83.3\xB0 W is -83.3. Since -87.7 is less than -83.3, that means Evanston is\
      \ further west. So yes, Northwestern University in IL is west of the University\
      \ of Georgia in GA.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should confirm the exact coordinates.\
      \ Let me think. Northwestern University's coordinates: Evanston, IL. A quick\
      \ search in my mind would say Evanston is at approximately 42.05\xB0 N, 87.68\xB0\
      \ W. University of Georgia in Athens, GA: Athens is around 33.96\xB0 N, 83.38\xB0\
      \ W. So comparing the longitudes: Evanston is at 87.68\xB0 W, Athens at 83.38\xB0\
      \ W. Since 87.68 is further west (more negative) than 83.38, Northwestern is\
      \ indeed west of UGA. Therefore, the answer is YES.</think>To determine if Northwestern\

    a870f081-c7aa-4c00-aefc-9b4e7ef7378a: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user is asking if Northwestern University in Illinois is located west\
      \ of the University of Georgia in Georgia. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure\
      \ out the locations of both universities. \n\nLet me start with Northwestern.\
      \ I know that Northwestern University is in Evanston, Illinois. Evanston is\
      \ a suburb just north of Chicago, right? So, Chicago is in the northeastern\
      \ part of Illinois, near Lake Michigan. That would place Northwestern in the\
      \ northern part of Illinois, close to the lake.\n\nNow, the University of Georgia.\
      \ That's in Athens, Georgia, I believe. Athens is northeast of Atlanta, which\
      \ is the capital of Georgia. Georgia is in the southeastern United States. So,\
      \ Athens would be in the northern part of Georgia, but still in the southeast\
      \ region of the country.\n\nNext, I need to compare their longitudes because\
      \ the question is about east-west positioning. The further west a location's\
      \ longitude, the more west it is. Longitude coordinates are measured in degrees\
      \ west or east of the prime meridian. So, if Northwestern has a more western\
      \ longitude (i.e., a higher degree in the west or a lower degree in the east),\
      \ then it would be west of the University of Georgia.\n\nLet me look up the\
      \ approximate longitudes. For Northwestern University in Evanston, IL: I think\
      \ Chicago is around 87.6\xB0 West. Evanston is just north, so maybe similar.\
      \ Let's say approximately 87.7\xB0 West. \n\nFor the University of Georgia in\
      \ Athens, GA: Atlanta is around 84.4\xB0 West. Athens is a bit east of Atlanta,\
      \ so maybe around 83.4\xB0 West. Wait, actually, I should check that. If Atlanta\
      \ is 84.4\xB0 W, then moving east from there would decrease the longitude. So\
      \ Athens, being northeast of Atlanta, might be around 83.3\xB0 W. \n\nSo comparing\
      \ 87.7\xB0 W (Northwestern) to 83.3\xB0 W (UGA). Since 87.7 is further west\
      \ than 83.3, that means Northwestern is indeed west of the University of Georgia.\
      \ \n\nWait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing up east and west. Lower longitude\
      \ numbers (more negative when expressed as negative degrees in the western hemisphere)\
      \ are further east. So, for example, 80\xB0 W is further east than 90\xB0 W.\
      \ So in this case, 83.3\xB0 W is east of 87.7\xB0 W. Therefore, Northwestern\
      \ at 87.7\xB0 W is west of UGA at 83.3\xB0 W. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So\
      \ the answer should be YES. But let me double-check the coordinates to be sure.\
      \ Maybe I can recall that Illinois is to the west of Georgia. Looking at a map,\
      \ Illinois is in the Midwest, while Georgia is in the Southeast. So moving from\
      \ Georgia to Illinois would be going northwest. Therefore, Illinois is west\
      \ of Georgia. So any university in Illinois would be west of one in Georgia,\
      \ assuming they're not in the extreme eastern parts. But Evanston is near Chicago,\
      \ which is in northeastern Illinois. Wait, but even northeastern Illinois is\
      \ still west of Georgia. Because Georgia is on the East Coast side. \n\nFor\
      \ example, the longitude of Atlanta, GA is about 84.388\xB0W, and Chicago, IL\
      \ is about 87.629\xB0W. Since 87.6 is west of 84.3, Chicago is west of Atlanta.\
      \ Therefore, Evanston, being just north of Chicago, is also west of Atlanta.\
      \ And since the University of Georgia is in Athens, which is east of Atlanta,\
      \ that would make Evanston even further west compared to Athens. \n\nSo yes,\
      \ Northwestern University in Illinois is located west of the University of Georgia\
      \ in Georgia.\n</think>To determine if Northwestern University (IL) is west\

      \ is slightly west of Dallas, so maybe around 97.7\xB0W? Or maybe I'm mixing\
      \ that up. Alternatively, I can think of major cities. For example, San Antonio\
      \ is about 98.5\xB0W, and Austin is a bit east of San Antonio. So maybe Austin\
      \ is around 97.7\xB0W.\n\nDuke University in Durham, NC: North Carolina is on\
      \ the east coast. Durham is in the central part of NC, near Raleigh. The longitude\

      \ about 78.6\xB0W, and Durham is nearby, so maybe 78.9\xB0W or something like\
      \ that. \n\nSo comparing the two: Austin, TX at approximately 97.7\xB0W and\
      \ Durham, NC at around 78.9\xB0W. Since longitude decreases as you go east,\
      \ the more westward location has a higher degree in the west. So 97.7\xB0W is\

      \ I should make sure I'm not mixing up the directions. The prime meridian is\
      \ 0\xB0, and as you go west from there, the longitude increases in the western\
      \ hemisphere. So yes, a higher number in west longitude means further west.\

      \ The College of Liberal Arts is part of that university, so its location is\
      \ the same as the main campus. Then Duke University's Graduate School is in\
      \ Durham, North Carolina, right? So the question boils down to whether Austin,\
      \ TX is west of Durham, NC.\n\nNow, I should check the geographic coordinates\
      \ of both cities. Let me recall: Austin is the capital of Texas, located in\
      \ the central part of the state, but more towards the east compared to, say,\
      \ El Paso. Durham is in North Carolina, which is on the East Coast. So intuitively,\
      \ Texas is west of the East Coast states, but I need to confirm the exact longitudes.\n\
      \nAustin's longitude is approximately 97.7431\xB0 West. Durham, NC is around\
      \ 78.8986\xB0 West. Wait, longitude lines run from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0\
      ) going west and east up to 180\xB0. So a higher degree West means further west.\
      \ For example, 97\xB0W is further west than 78\xB0W. So Austin at 97.7\xB0W\
      \ is indeed west of Durham at 78.9\xB0W. \n\nLet me double-check the longitudes\
      \ to be sure. Quick search in my mind: yes, Texas is in the Central Time Zone,\
      \ which is UTC-6, while North Carolina is in Eastern Time, UTC-5. This also\
      \ makes sense because the time zones shift every 15 degrees of longitude. Since\
      \ Texas is in a time zone one hour behind North Carolina, it's further west.\

      \ Wait, longitude is measured from the prime meridian, so lower numbers (more\

      \ and then you get to Mississippi, Alabama, and then Florida. Tallahassee is\
      \ in the Florida Panhandle, which is the part of Florida that's closest to the\
      \ west. But Phoenix is definitely further west. For example, the longitude of\
      \ Phoenix is around 112 degrees West, and Tallahassee is around 84 degrees West.\
      \ Wait, no, wait. Wait, longitude for the US is all west of the prime meridian,\
      \ so Phoenix is approximately 112\xB0W, and Tallahassee is around 84\xB0W. Wait,\
      \ but that can't be right because 84\xB0W would be further east. Wait, no, higher\
      \ numbers west mean further west. Wait, no, longitude decreases as you go east.\
      \ So, for example, New York is around 74\xB0W, Chicago around 87\xB0W, Denver\
      \ around 105\xB0W, and Los Angeles around 118\xB0W. So Phoenix, being in Arizona,\
      \ is around 112\xB0W. Tallahassee, Florida, is in the eastern time zone, which\
      \ is around 75\xB0W to 90\xB0W. Let me check exact coordinates.\n\nLooking up,\
      \ Tallahassee's coordinates are approximately 30.4383\xB0 N, 84.2807\xB0 W.\
      \ Phoenix, AZ is approximately 33.4484\xB0 N, 112.0740\xB0 W. So Phoenix's longitude\
      \ is 112.074\xB0W, and Tallahassee's is 84.2807\xB0W. Since 112 is west of 84,\
      \ that means Phoenix is west of Tallahassee. Therefore, the University of Phoenix,\
      \ AZ is located west of Florida State University, FL. So the answer should be\
      \ YES.\n</think>The University of Phoenix is based in Phoenix, Arizona, with\

      \ is located in Tallahassee, Florida, at approximately 30.4383\xB0 N, 84.2807\xB0\
      \ W. Since Phoenix's longitude (112.074\xB0 W) is farther west than Tallahassee's\
      \ (84.2807\xB0 W), the University of Phoenix is indeed west of Florida State\
      \ University. \n\nANSWER: YES"

      \ but Phoenix is a city in Arizona, so that's the main campus probably. Then\
      \ Florida State University is in Tallahassee, Florida, right? Now, I need to\
      \ determine the longitude of both cities because longitude determines east-west\
      \ positioning. The further west a location is (lower longitude in the western\
      \ hemisphere), the more west it is. Wait, no, in the US, longitude is measured\
      \ west from the prime meridian. So higher longitude (more west) would be further\
      \ west. For example, the west coast has higher longitude values (like 120\xB0\
      W) compared to the east coast (around 75\xB0W to 80\xB0W). \n\nWait, actually,\
      \ when you're in the western hemisphere, the longitude is west, so higher numbers\
      \ as you go west. So, for example, California is around 120\xB0W, Arizona is\
      \ around 112\xB0W, and Florida is around 80\xB0W to 85\xB0W. So, Phoenix, AZ\
      \ should be around 112\xB0W longitude, and Tallahassee, FL would be around 84.28\xB0\
      W (I think I've heard that before). So comparing the two: 112\xB0W vs 84\xB0\
      W. Since 112 is west of 84, that means Phoenix is west of Tallahassee. Therefore,\

      \ The exact longitude is what matters here.\n\nLet me think about the approximate\

      Now, the University of Phoenix. Wait, the University of Phoenix is an online\

      \ YES"
    aa38a2ac-b7d8-4190-8b9e-aeba70829f21: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ The user wants to know if the University of Phoenix in Arizona is located\
      \ west of Florida State University in Florida. Hmm, first, I need to figure\
      \ out where each of these universities is located.\n\nStarting with the University\
      \ of Phoenix. I know that Phoenix is the capital city of Arizona. Arizona is\
      \ a state in the southwestern United States. So the University of Phoenix is\
      \ in Phoenix, AZ. Now, Florida State University is in Florida. Florida is the\
      \ southeasternmost state, right? The university's main campus is in Tallahassee,\
      \ which is the capital of Florida.\n\nNext, I need to determine the longitudinal\

      \ west a location is. The further west a place is (higher longitude in the western\
      \ hemisphere), the more west it is compared to another location. Wait, no, actually,\
      \ in the context of the US, since all longitudes are west of the prime meridian,\
      \ a higher numerical value (more negative when expressed as degrees west) means\
      \ further west. But sometimes longitude is given as degrees west, so a larger\
      \ number would mean further west. For example, if Phoenix is at, say, 112 degrees\
      \ west longitude, and Tallahassee is at 84 degrees west, then Phoenix would\
      \ be west of Tallahassee because 112 is greater than 84. Wait, but longitude\
      \ west is measured from 0 at the prime meridian going west to 180. So a place\
      \ with a longitude of 112\xB0W is further west than 84\xB0W. So yes, higher\
      \ number (more west) means further west.\n\nLet me check approximate longitudes.\
      \ Phoenix, AZ: I think Phoenix is around 112 degrees west longitude. Tallahassee,\
      \ FL: Florida's panhandle, so maybe around 84 degrees west. Let me verify. \n\
      \nChecking in my mind, Phoenix is indeed in the Mountain Time Zone, which is\
      \ UTC-7, while Tallahassee is in the Eastern Time Zone, UTC-5. Time zones can\
      \ give a rough idea. The US time zones from east to west are Eastern (UTC-5),\

      \ Time, but actually, most of Arizona doesn't observe daylight saving time,\
      \ but that's aside. The key point is that Mountain Time is west of Central,\
      \ which is west of Eastern. So geographically, Arizona is west of Florida.\n\
      \nBut to get precise, let's think about actual longitudes. The approximate longitude\
      \ of Tallahassee, FL is about 84.28\xB0W. Phoenix, AZ is around 112.07\xB0W.\
      \ Since 112.07\xB0W is further west than 84.28\xB0W, Phoenix is indeed west\

      \ confusing. Let me think again. If you go west from the prime meridian (0\xB0\
      ), the longitude becomes negative in the western hemisphere. So a place at -112\xB0\
      \ is further west than one at -84\xB0, because -112\xB0 is more west (more negative).\
      \ So the more negative the longitude, the further west the location. \n\nSo\

      \ Tallahassee's coordinates are approximately 30.4383\xB0 N, 84.2807\xB0 W.\
      \ So longitude is -84.2807\xB0.\n\nNow the University of Phoenix. Wait, the\

      .\n\nComparing the two longitudes: Florida State is at -84.28\xB0, University\
      \ of Phoenix is at -112.07\xB0. Since -112.07 is more negative (further west)\

      \ right? I think they do have some physical locations, though they are known\
      \ for online programs.\n\nThen Florida State University is in Florida. Specifically,\
      \ the main campus is in Tallahassee, which is the capital of Florida. So FSU\
      \ is in Tallahassee, FL. Now, I need to compare the longitudes of Phoenix, AZ\

      \ west longitudes are negative numbers (like in the US). Wait, actually, in\
      \ the US, the longitude is measured west from the Prime Meridian, so locations\
      \ in the US have negative longitude values. For example, California is around\

      \ The more negative the longitude (the smaller the number, but in negative terms,\

      \ the longitude becomes negative, and each degree west is a more negative number.\
      \ So Phoenix, AZ is further west than Tallahassee, FL. Because Arizona is in\
      \ the Mountain Time Zone or maybe Pacific sometimes, while Florida is in the\
      \ Eastern Time Zone. The further west a location is in the US, the more negative\
      \ its longitude. So Phoenix is around -112 degrees longitude, and Tallahassee\

      \ system. For example, Phoenix is around 112\xB0W, and Tallahassee is around\
      \ 84.28\xB0W. Wait, but longitude west is typically expressed as a negative\
      \ number when using the coordinate system where east is positive. So Phoenix,\
      \ AZ has a longitude of approximately -112\xB0 (or 112\xB0W), and Tallahassee,\
      \ FL is around -84.28\xB0 (84.28\xB0W). \n\nSince longitude measures how far\
      \ west a location is, a more negative (or higher in degrees west) value means\
      \ it's further west. So Phoenix at around 112\xB0W is further west than Tallahassee\
      \ at 84.28\xB0W. Therefore, Phoenix, AZ is west of Tallahassee, FL. Therefore,\
      \ the University of Phoenix, AZ is located west of Florida State University,\
      \ FL.\n\nWait, but I should double-check the exact longitudes. Let me think.\
      \ Phoenix, Arizona's coordinates are approximately 33.45\xB0N latitude, 112.07\xB0\
      W longitude. Florida State University in Tallahassee is at about 30.44\xB0N,\
      \ 84.28\xB0W. Comparing the longitudes: 112.07\xB0W vs. 84.28\xB0W. Since 112.07\
      \ is a larger number west, that means Phoenix is further west. So yes, University\
      \ of Phoenix is west of Florida State University.\n</think>The University of\

    841bb986-a66e-4bfc-8697-ab284e04e32a: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Arizona State University in Arizona is located west of Harvard Summer School\

      \ \n\nFirst, I know that Arizona State University (ASU) is in Arizona. The main\
      \ campus is in Tempe, which is part of the Phoenix metropolitan area. Arizona\
      \ is in the southwestern part of the United States. Harvard Summer School, on\
      \ the other hand, is part of Harvard University, which is located in Cambridge,\
      \ Massachusetts. Cambridge is near Boston, so that's in the northeastern US.\
      \ \n\nNow, the question is about their relative west-east positions. To determine\
      \ if ASU is west of Harvard, I need to compare their longitudes. Places with\
      \ higher longitude values are further east if we're using the convention that\
      \ longitude increases eastward. Wait, actually, in the context of the Earth's\
      \ coordinates, longitude is measured east or west from the prime meridian. So,\
      \ a location in the western hemisphere (like the US) would have a west longitude\
      \ if it's west of the prime meridian, but in the US, all longitudes are west\
      \ of the prime meridian, so they are typically expressed as degrees west, which\
      \ could be represented as negative numbers in decimal degrees (e.g., -75 degrees\
      \ is 75 degrees west).\n\nBut maybe I can think in terms of absolute longitude\
      \ values. The further west a place is, the more negative its longitude (if using\
      \ the Prime Meridian as 0). Alternatively, in the US, moving from east to west,\
      \ the longitude becomes more negative. For example, the east coast (like Massachusetts)\
      \ is around -70 to -73 degrees, while Arizona is around -111 to -112 degrees\
      \ longitude. Since lower longitude values (more negative) are further west,\
      \ Arizona would indeed be west of Massachusetts.\n\nBut let me confirm the actual\
      \ coordinates. I'll try to remember or estimate. Harvard in Cambridge, MA: Cambridge\
      \ is near Boston. The longitude of Boston is approximately 71.06\xB0 W, which\
      \ is -71.06 in decimal. Arizona State's Tempe campus: Phoenix area's longitude\
      \ is about 111.5\xB0 W, which is -111.5. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait,\
      \ wait, no. Phoenix, Arizona is actually around 112 degrees West longitude.\
      \ Wait, but I might be confusing. Let me think again. The US uses degrees west,\
      \ so Boston is around 71\xB0W, and Phoenix is around 112\xB0W. Since higher\
      \ numerical value in degrees west means further west. So 112\xB0W is further\
      \ west than 71\xB0W. Therefore, Arizona State, being at 112\xB0W, is west of\
      \ Harvard at 71\xB0W. Wait, but wait, longitude west is measured as 0 to 180\
      \ degrees west. So 112\xB0W is indeed west of 71\xB0W. Therefore, the answer\
      \ would be yes.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check specific coordinates. For\
      \ example, Harvard Summer School's location in Cambridge, MA: let's say the\
      \ exact coordinates are approximately 42.3736\xB0 N, 71.1097\xB0 W. Arizona\
      \ State University in Tempe, AZ: approximately 33.4255\xB0 N, 111.9400\xB0 W.\
      \ Comparing the longitudes: 71.1097\xB0 W vs. 111.9400\xB0 W. Since 111.94 is\
      \ a larger number than 71.1097 when considering west longitude, which means\
      \ it's further west. So ASU's longitude is more west than Harvard's. Therefore,\
      \ Arizona State University is indeed located west of Harvard Summer School.\

      \ so that's a 2-hour difference. Each hour corresponds to roughly 15 degrees,\
      \ so 2 hours would be about 30 degrees. But wait, actually, the time zones are\
      \ not perfectly aligned by every 15 degrees, but it's a rough estimate.\n\n\
      Alternatively, perhaps I can remember approximate longitudes. For example, Massachusetts\
      \ is on the east coast. Boston, which is near Cambridge, is around 71 degrees\
      \ west longitude. Arizona is further west. Tempe, AZ, is near Phoenix. Phoenix's\
      \ longitude is about 112 degrees west. Wait, that can't be right because 112\
      \ would be way west, like near Utah maybe? Wait, no. Let me check mentally.\
      \ The continental US spans from approximately 67 degrees west (east coast, like\
      \ Maine) to around 125 degrees west (west coast, like Washington state). So,\
      \ Boston is around 71\xB0W, and Phoenix, AZ is around 112\xB0W? Wait that seems\
      \ too far. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me correct.\n\nWait, Phoenix, AZ is\
      \ actually at about 112 degrees west longitude? Wait, no. Let me see: California\
      \ is around 120\xB0W, so Arizona, being east of California, should be less than\
      \ that. Maybe around 112\xB0W for Phoenix. Then Boston (Cambridge) is around\
      \ 71\xB0W. So 112\xB0W is west of 71\xB0W. Wait, no. Wait, longitude west increases\
      \ as you go west. So a higher numerical value in the west direction. So if Phoenix\
      \ is at 112\xB0W and Cambridge at 71\xB0W, then Phoenix is west of Cambridge\
      \ because 112 is a higher number west. Wait, but longitude west is measured\
      \ as degrees from the prime meridian increasing westward. So yes, a higher degree\
      \ in the west direction means further west. So 112\xB0W is west of 71\xB0W.\
      \ So, Arizona State University in Tempe, AZ (around 112\xB0W) would be west\
      \ of Harvard in Cambridge, MA (around 71\xB0W). Therefore, the answer is YES.\
      \ \n\nWait, but let me double-check the exact coordinates to be sure. Maybe\
      \ I made a mistake. Suppose Harvard is in Cambridge, MA, which is near Boston.\
      \ Boston's coordinates are approximately 42\xB0N, 71\xB0W. Phoenix, AZ is at\
      \ approximately 33\xB0N, 112\xB0W. Comparing the longitude: 112\xB0W vs. 71\xB0\
      W. Since 112 is greater than 71, it's further west. Therefore, Arizona State\
      \ University is west of Harvard Summer School. So the answer should be YES.\n\

      \ question is whether Arizona State University in Arizona is located west of\
      \ Harvard Summer School in Massachusetts.\n\nFirst, I need to know where each\
      \ of these places is. Arizona State University is in Arizona, which is in the\
      \ southwestern part of the US. Harvard Summer School is part of Harvard University,\
      \ which is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Cambridge is near Boston, so in the\
      \ northeastern US.\n\nNow, I remember that the US states are laid out with the\
      \ western states like California, Arizona, Nevada, etc., being on the west coast\
      \ or southwest, while the northeastern states like Massachusetts, New York,\
      \ etc., are on the east coast.\n\nBut to be precise, I should think about the\
      \ longitude. The further west a location is, the higher its longitude value\
      \ (in the western hemisphere, longitude is measured as west from the prime meridian).\
      \ So if Arizona State has a higher west longitude than Harvard, then it's further\

      \ you go west). Wait, actually, no. Longitude in the western hemisphere is measured\
      \ as west longitude, so for example, Arizona would be around 110-112 degrees\
      \ west, while Massachusetts is around 71 degrees west. Wait, no, that doesn't\
      \ make sense. Let me clarify. \n\nThe prime meridian is 0 degrees, and as you\
      \ go west from there up to 180 degrees (the international date line). So locations\
      \ in the US have west longitude, meaning their longitude is measured in degrees\

      \ west, while Los Angeles is around 118 degrees west. The higher the number,\
      \ the further west. So if Arizona State has a higher longitude (more west) than\

      \ Phoenix, AZ is approximately at 112 degrees west. Harvard in Cambridge, MA\
      \ is around 71 degrees west. So comparing 112 (ASU) and 71 (Harvard). Since\
      \ 112 is greater than 71, that means ASU is further west. So yes, Arizona State\

      \ So, the user is asking if Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine\

      \ out where each of these schools is located. Let's start with Cornell. I know\
      \ Cornell University is in Ithaca, NY. But wait, the College of Veterinary Medicine\
      \ is part of Cornell, so it should be on their main campus in Ithaca. Right?\
      \ Ithaca is in upstate New York, kind of in the central part of the state, near\
      \ the Finger Lakes. \n\nNow, Columbia University's School of International and\
      \ Public Affairs (SIPA) is in New York City, specifically in Manhattan. Columbia's\
      \ main campus is in Morningside Heights, which is on the west side of Manhattan.\
      \ So SIPA is part of that campus. \n\nNext, I need to determine the geographical\

      \ N, 73.9626\xB0 W. Comparing the longitude: the more negative the longitude,\

      \ Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine in NY is west of Columbia\
      \ University's School of International and Public Affairs, also in NY. \n\n\
      First, I need to know where each of these schools is located. I know that Columbia\
      \ University is in New York City, specifically in Manhattan. The School of International\
      \ and Public Affairs (SIPA) is part of Columbia, so it's definitely in Manhattan.\
      \ Manhattan's coordinates are roughly around 40.7128\xB0 N, 74.0060\xB0 W.\n\
      \nCornell University is in Ithaca, NY. Ithaca is upstate, so I think it's north\
      \ of NYC. But the question is about east or west. The coordinates for Cornell\
      \ are approximately 42.4485\xB0 N, 76.4782\xB0 W. \n\nNow, comparing the longitudes:\
      \ Columbia is at about 74.0060\xB0 W, and Cornell is at 76.4782\xB0 W. Since\
      \ longitude increases as you go west, a higher number means further west. So\
      \ 76.4782 is west of 74.0060. Therefore, Cornell's Vet Med college is west of\
      \ Columbia's SIPA. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. Sometimes people\
      \ get confused with east vs. west in longitude. The prime meridian is 0\xB0\
      , and as you go west from there, the longitude becomes west (negative in some\
      \ systems). So higher west longitude means further west. So yes, 76\xB0W is\
      \ west of 74\xB0W. So Cornell is indeed west of Columbia. \n\nBut wait, Ithaca\
      \ is in upstate New York, which is generally considered to be north and west\
      \ of NYC. So that makes sense. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \n\
      **Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Locate Columbia University (SIPA):** Situated\
      \ in Manhattan, NYC, with approximate coordinates 40.7128\xB0 N, 74.0060\xB0\
      \ W.  \n2. **Locate Cornell Vet Med:** In Ithaca, NY, with coordinates ~42.4485\xB0\
      \ N, 76.4782\xB0 W.  \n3. **Compare Longitudes:** Cornell\u2019s longitude (76.4782\xB0\
      \ W) is numerically higher than Columbia\u2019s (74.0060\xB0 W). Since higher\
      \ west longitude = farther west, Cornell Vet Med is west of Columbia SIPA. \

      \ The question is whether Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine\

      \ check their locations relative to each other.\n\nFirst, I know that Columbia\
      \ University is in New York City. Specifically, the main campus is in Manhattan,\
      \ right? The School of International and Public Affairs would be part of that\
      \ main campus. So SIPA's address is probably in Morningside Heights, Manhattan.\
      \ \n\nNow, Cornell University's main campus is in Ithaca, NY. But wait, does\
      \ the College of Veterinary Medicine have a different location? I think Cornell's\
      \ Vet Med school is also in Ithaca. Ithaca is in upstate New York, which is\
      \ northwest of New York City. But wait, directions can be tricky. Let me confirm.\n\
      \nLooking at a map, Manhattan (where Columbia is) is on the eastern side of\
      \ New York state, along the Hudson River. Ithaca, on the other hand, is in the\
      \ Finger Lakes region, which is more towards the central-western part of New\
      \ York state. So, from Manhattan, Ithaca is to the northwest. But the question\
      \ is whether Cornell Vet Med is west of Columbia SIPA. If Ithaca is northwest\
      \ of NYC, then yes, it is west relative to Manhattan. Because Manhattan is east,\
      \ Ithaca is west of it.\n\nBut wait, directions: When comparing two points,\
      \ west or east depends on their longitudes. The location with the more western\
      \ longitude is further west. So, let's think about coordinates. Columbia University\
      \ in NYC is at approximately 40.8075\xB0 N, 73.9626\xB0 W. Cornell's Vet School\
      \ in Ithaca is around 42.4485\xB0 N, 76.4759\xB0 W. Wait, longitude: the higher\
      \ the number west, the further west it is. So 76.4759\xB0W is more west than\
      \ 73.9626\xB0W. Therefore, Ithaca (Cornell Vet Med) is west of NYC (Columbia\
      \ SIPA). So the answer should be YES.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure there\
      \ isn't another campus. Does Cornell have any facilities in NYC? The main campus\
      \ is Ithaca, and the Vet Med is part of that. So unless the Vet Med is in another\
      \ location, which I don't think it is, then the answer is yes. Therefore, Cornell\
      \ Vet Med is west of Columbia SIPA.\n</think>YES  \nCornell University's College\

      \ Affairs is part of Columbia, so it's likely situated on their main campus\
      \ in Morningside Heights, which is in the Upper West Side of Manhattan. \n\n\
      Cornell University is a bit trickier because it's part of the Ivy League but\
      \ isn't in NYC. I remember that Cornell's main campus is in Ithaca, New York,\
      \ which is upstate. However, the question specifically mentions the College\
      \ of Veterinary Medicine. I think the vet school is part of the main campus\
      \ in Ithaca. But wait, maybe they have another location? Let me confirm. \n\n\
      Quick check: Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine is indeed located in Ithaca,\
      \ NY. So Ithaca is in upstate New York, while Columbia's SIPA is in Manhattan.\
      \ Now, to determine their relative positions: is Ithaca west of Manhattan?\n\
      \nI need to think about the geography of New York State. Manhattan is on the\
      \ southern part of the state, along the Hudson River. Ithaca is in the Finger\
      \ Lakes region, which is more towards the central-western part of the state.\
      \ So, in terms of longitude, Ithaca would be west of Manhattan. \n\nBut to be\
      \ precise, I should maybe look up the exact coordinates or at least the general\
      \ direction. Let me recall that New York City is around 74 degrees west longitude.\
      \ Ithaca, NY, I believe, is around 76 degrees west longitude. Wait, no, longitude\
      \ increases as you go west, but actually, the more westward a location is, the\
      \ higher the longitude value (in the western hemisphere). So if Ithaca is west\
      \ of NYC, its longitude would be a higher number (more west). \n\nNew York City's\
      \ longitude is approximately 74.0060\xB0 W. Ithaca, NY's longitude is about\
      \ 76.5000\xB0 W. Since 76.5 is greater than 74.006, that means Ithaca is indeed\
      \ west of NYC. Therefore, Cornell's vet school in Ithaca is west of Columbia's\
      \ SIPA in Manhattan. \n\nSo the answer should be YES.\n</think>The College of\

      \ Cornell University is in Ithaca, NY. But wait, the College of Veterinary Medicine\
      \ is part of Cornell, so it should be in Ithaca as well. Ithaca is in upstate\
      \ New York, right? It's in the central part of the state, near the Finger Lakes\

      \ centrally located in the state, but in terms of longitude, is it west of NYC?\
      \ \n\nNew York City is at approximately 74\xB0W longitude. Ithaca, NY, is around\
      \ 76.5\xB0W. Wait, no, actually, let me check that. Wait, longitude decreases\

      \ Hmm, let's start by recalling the locations of these two states. Texas is\
      \ in the southern part of the US, and Virginia is on the East Coast. So, generally,\
      \ I think Texas is to the west of Virginia. But wait, Texas is a big state.\
      \ Where exactly is Texas A&M located? I remember that Texas A&M is in College\
      \ Station, Texas. And the University of Virginia is in Charlottesville, Virginia.\
      \ \n\nNow I need to check the longitudes of both cities because longitude determines\
      \ east-west position. The further west a place is, the higher its longitude\
      \ value (in the western hemisphere, longitude is measured as west from the prime\
      \ meridian, but I think in the US, it's all west longitude, so higher numbers\
      \ mean further west). \n\nLet me look up the approximate longitudes. From memory,\
      \ Charlottesville, VA is around 78 degrees west longitude. College Station,\
      \ TX is around 96 degrees west longitude. Wait, no, 96 might be too far west.\
      \ Let me think. Austin, Texas is around 97 degrees west. College Station is\

      \ 96\xB0W is further west than 78\xB0W. Yes, because as you go west from the\

    29e4d928-b846-47cb-93d7-5379076ade2d: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Texas A&M University in Texas is located west of the University of Virginia\
      \ in Virginia. Let me start by recalling where these two states are. \n\nFirst,\
      \ Texas is a big state in the southern part of the United States, right? It's\
      \ known for being pretty large, and I think it's more towards the central and\
      \ southwestern areas. Virginia is on the East Coast, part of the original 13\
      \ colonies. So I'm guessing Virginia is further east than Texas. But wait, Texas\
      \ does have a panhandle and extends pretty far west, but how does its longitude\
      \ compare to Virginia's?\n\nLet me think about the capitals. The capital of\
      \ Texas is Austin, and the University of Virginia is in Charlottesville. Wait,\
      \ but Texas A&M is actually in College Station, Texas. So I should check the\
      \ longitude of College Station, TX, and Charlottesville, VA. Longitude measures\
      \ east-west position, so if College Station's longitude is further west (i.e.,\
      \ a higher negative number if we're using the prime meridian as 0), then it\
      \ would be west of Charlottesville.\n\nWhat's the longitude of College Station,\
      \ TX? I remember that Texas generally is in the Central Time Zone, which is\
      \ UTC-6, while Virginia is in the Eastern Time Zone, UTC-5. But time zones are\
      \ rough guides. For example, parts of Texas might be in a different time zone,\
      \ but College Station is in Central Time. Eastern Time is further east than\
      \ Central, so places in Eastern Time are further east. So logically, if College\
      \ Station is in Central Time, and Charlottesville is in Eastern, then Charlottesville\
      \ is east of College Station. Wait, but that's not necessarily always true because\
      \ time zones can have irregular boundaries. For example, some areas might be\
      \ in a time zone that doesn't strictly follow the longitude lines.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe looking up the actual longitude coordinates would be better. Let me\
      \ try to recall approximate longitudes. The Eastern Time Zone is roughly between\
      \ 67.5\xB0W and 82.5\xB0W. Central Time is 82.5\xB0W to 97.5\xB0W. So if College\
      \ Station is in Central Time, its longitude is between 82.5\xB0W and 97.5\xB0\
      W. Charlottesville, being in Eastern Time, would be between 67.5\xB0W and 82.5\xB0\
      W. So the dividing line between Eastern and Central is around 82.5\xB0W. So\
      \ if College Station is west of 82.5\xB0W, and Charlottesville is east of that,\
      \ then College Station would be west of Charlottesville.\n\nBut does College\
      \ Station's longitude actually fall west of 82.5\xB0W? Let me try to remember.\
      \ For example, cities like Houston, Texas are around 95\xB0W. College Station\
      \ is near Houston, so maybe around 96.3\xB0W. Meanwhile, Charlottesville, VA\
      \ is in the eastern part of Virginia. Let's say Charlottesville's longitude\
      \ is around 78.5\xB0W. If that's the case, then College Station at 96\xB0W would\
      \ be west of Charlottesville's 78\xB0W. So the answer would be YES, Texas A&M\
      \ is west of UVA.\n\nBut wait, let me verify the coordinates. I might be mixing\
      \ up some numbers. For example, the approximate longitude for Charlottesville,\
      \ VA is about 78 degrees west. For College Station, TX, it's approximately 96.3\
      \ degrees west. Since 96.3\xB0W is further west than 78\xB0W, that would mean\
      \ College Station is indeed west of Charlottesville. Therefore, Texas A&M is\
      \ located west of the University of Virginia. So the answer is YES.\n</think>To\
      \ determine if Texas A&M University (College Station, TX) is west of the University\
      \ of Virginia (Charlottesville, VA), we compare their longitudes:  \n- **College\
      \ Station, TX**: ~96.3\xB0W  \n- **Charlottesville, VA**: ~78.5\xB0W  \n\nSince\
      \ 96.3\xB0W is further west than 78.5\xB0W, Texas A&M lies west of the University\
      \ of Virginia.  \n\n**Answer**: YES."
    53aec98f-c1d0-40a7-935b-503e3bfa9aae: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Texas A&M University in Texas is located west of the University of\
      \ Virginia in Virginia. Hmm, I need to figure out the longitudes of both universities\
      \ to determine their east-west positions.\n\nFirst, I remember that Texas is\
      \ generally west of Virginia. But universities can be in different parts of\
      \ their states. For example, the University of Virginia is in Charlottesville,\
      \ VA. Where is Texas A&M located? I think it's in College Station, Texas. So\
      \ I need the longitude coordinates of both cities.\n\nLet me recall: Charlottesville,\
      \ VA. I think it's in the central part of Virginia. Texas is a big state, so\
      \ College Station might be in the eastern part? But Texas is definitely west\
      \ of Virginia overall. Wait, longitude is the key here. The further west a place\
      \ is, the higher its longitude value (in the western hemisphere, longitude is\
      \ measured as negative degrees west of the Prime Meridian). Wait no, actually,\
      \ in the US, longitudes are west, so they are negative numbers. So a more westerly\
      \ location would have a more negative longitude. For example, California is\
      \ around -120\xB0, whereas Virginia is around -78\xB0. So if Texas A&M is west\
      \ of UVA, its longitude would be more negative (i.e., lower numerical value\
      \ if we ignore the negative sign\u2014it's further west). Wait, but actually,\
      \ in terms of numerical value (since west longitudes are negative), if a place\
      \ is further west, its longitude is a smaller number. For example, New York\
      \ is around -74\xB0, and Los Angeles is -118\xB0, which is more west. So -118\
      \ is less than -74. So when comparing, the one with the more negative (smaller)\
      \ longitude is further west.\n\nSo, University of Virginia is in Charlottesville.\
      \ Let me check approximate longitude. Charlottesville, VA: I think it's around\
      \ 78 degrees west longitude. So approximately -78.4 degrees. Texas A&M in College\
      \ Station, TX: Texas is a big state, so College Station is east Texas? Or more\
      \ central? Let me think. College Station is north of Houston, which is in southeast\
      \ Texas. So College Station is east of central Texas but still in the eastern\
      \ half. The longitude for College Station is probably around -96.3 degrees.\
      \ Wait, Houston is around -95.3, so College Station might be similar? Maybe\
      \ a bit west? Let me confirm. Houston is approximately 29.7604\xB0 N, 95.3698\xB0\
      \ W. College Station is around 30.6280\xB0 N, 96.3344\xB0 W. So that longitude\
      \ is about -96.33. Whereas Charlottesville, VA is around 38.0293\xB0 N, 78.4767\xB0\
      \ W. So -78.4767.\n\nComparing the two longitudes: College Station is at approximately\
      \ -96.33\xB0, and Charlottesville is at -78.48\xB0. Since -96.33 is west of\
      \ -78.48 (because -96.33 is more negative), that means College Station, TX is\
      \ indeed west of Charlottesville, VA. Therefore, Texas A&M University (in College\
      \ Station) is west of the University of Virginia (in Charlottesville).\n</think>To\

      \ west (since west longitudes are negative in decimal degrees). Wait, maybe\
      \ I'm confusing this. Let me clarify.\n\nThe Prime Meridian is 0 degrees. Moving\
      \ west from there, the longitude becomes negative (in the decimal system). So,\
      \ for example, New York is around -74 degrees, and Los Angeles is around -118\
      \ degrees. So Los Angeles is further west, hence a more negative (lower) longitude.\
      \ So, to compare Texas A&M (College Station) and UVA (Charlottesville), I need\

      \ The University of Virginia is in Charlottesville, Virginia. Now, I need to\

      \ east-west positioning. The further west a location is (i.e., the more negative\
      \ its longitude if we're using the Western Hemisphere where the US is), the\
      \ further west it is.\n\nSo, let me think about the general locations. Texas\
      \ is a big state in the south-central part of the US, while Virginia is on the\
      \ East Coast. Texas is definitely further west than Virginia as a state. But\
      \ wait, College Station isn't in west Texas; it's more in the eastern part of\
      \ Texas. But Texas as a whole is west of Virginia. So maybe College Station,\
      \ even in east Texas, is still west of Charlottesville.\n\nBut maybe I should\
      \ get specific coordinates. Let me try to remember or estimate. Charlottesville,\
      \ VA, is in the eastern part of Virginia. The University of Virginia is there.\
      \ The approximate longitude for Charlottesville is around -78.4 degrees. Texas\
      \ A&M in College Station, TX\u2014College Station is near Houston, so Houston's\
      \ longitude is about -95.4, but College Station is a bit northwest of Houston.\
      \ Let me check\u2014maybe College Station's longitude is around -96.3 or something?\
      \ Wait, Houston is around -95.4, so College Station might be a bit west of that.\
      \ Wait, no\u2014if Houston is on the coast, then College Station is inland.\
      \ So moving northwest from Houston, longitude becomes more west (more negative).\
      \ So maybe College Station is around -96.3 degrees. Meanwhile, Charlottesville\
      \ is at approximately -78.4 degrees.\n\nComparing the two: -96.3 (Texas A&M)\
      \ vs. -78.4 (UVA). Since -96.3 is more west (because lower in value, i.e., more\
      \ negative) than -78.4, that would mean Texas A&M is west of UVA. So the answer\
      \ should be YES. Wait, but maybe I got the longitudes wrong. Let me try to recall\

    9a705256-d8c7-425d-b2c3-458b494e148d: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question:\
      \ Is Texas A&M University, TX located west of the University of Virginia, VA?\
      \ I need to figure out the answer step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably\
      \ determine the locations of both universities. Let's start with Texas A&M.\
      \ I know that Texas A&M is in Texas, but where exactly? I think the main campus\
      \ is in College Station, Texas. I remember hearing that College Station is in\
      \ the eastern part of Texas, maybe near Houston? Let me confirm. Yes, College\
      \ Station is indeed in eastern Texas, about halfway between Dallas and Houston,\
      \ but more to the east-central part of the state. Its coordinates are approximately\
      \ 30.6186\xB0 N, 96.3364\xB0 W.\n\nNow, the University of Virginia is in Virginia.\
      \ The main campus is in Charlottesville, Virginia. I need to check where Charlottesville\
      \ is located within Virginia. Virginia is on the east coast, so Charlottesville\
      \ is probably in the central part of the state. Let me get the coordinates.\
      \ Charlottesville's coordinates are around 38.0366\xB0 N, 78.4853\xB0 W.\n\n\
      Next, I need to compare the longitude of both places because longitude determines\
      \ east-west position. The further west a location is, the higher its longitude\
      \ value in the western hemisphere (since west longitude is measured as negative\
      \ degrees, but when considering numerical values without the sign, a higher\
      \ number in the west means further west). Wait, actually, in terms of absolute\
      \ position, a more westerly location would have a more negative longitude if\
      \ we're using the convention where west longitudes are negative. For example,\
      \ Texas A&M is at approximately 96.3364\xB0 W, and UVA is at 78.4853\xB0 W.\
      \ So, 96.3\xB0W is further west than 78.4\xB0W because 96 is a larger number\
      \ than 78 when both are west longitudes. Therefore, since College Station, TX\
      \ has a higher degree of west longitude than Charlottesville, VA, it is indeed\
      \ located further west.\n\nWait, just to double-check, sometimes I get confused\
      \ between east and west. Let me recall that in the United States, as you go\
      \ from the east coast to the west coast, the longitude becomes more west (i.e.,\
      \ the numbers increase going westward). So, for example, New York is around\
      \ 74\xB0W, Chicago is around 87\xB0W, Denver is about 105\xB0W, and Los Angeles\
      \ is around 118\xB0W. So, the higher the number (in terms of degrees west),\
      \ the further west the location. Therefore, since Texas A&M is at 96.3\xB0W\
      \ and UVA is at 78.4\xB0W, Texas A&M is indeed west of UVA.\n\nSo the answer\
      \ should be YES.\n</think>To determine if Texas A&M University (TX) is west\

      \ central Texas, maybe around 96 degrees west longitude. But wait, the negative\
      \ sign is because it's west of the prime meridian. So, for example, Charlottesville,\
      \ VA: I think it's approximately 78 degrees west, so -78.0. College Station,\
      \ TX: I think it's around 96 degrees west, so -96.3 or something like that.\
      \ \n\nBut wait, longitude for College Station, TX: Let me recall. Austin, TX\

      \ lower longitude value (more negative), it's further west. For example, California\

      \ the southeast part of the state, and as you go west from there, you get into\
      \ upstate New York. Syracuse is one of the major cities there. So Syracuse,\
      \ NY, is in central New York, probably west of Albany, which is the capital.\
      \ But how does that compare to MIT's location?\n\nMassachusetts is east of New\
      \ York state. So if MIT is in eastern Massachusetts, and Syracuse is in central\
      \ New York, then Syracuse would be west of MIT. Because New York state is to\
      \ the west of Massachusetts. Let me visualize a map. If you look at the US Northeast,\
      \ Massachusetts is to the east, and New York is to the west. So any point in\
      \ New York state would be west of any point in Massachusetts. Wait, is that\
      \ true? Because Massachusetts is to the east of New York, but the actual longitude\
      \ might vary. For example, the western part of Massachusetts might be further\
      \ west than parts of eastern New York. But MIT is in Cambridge, MA, which is\
      \ on the eastern side of Massachusetts. Syracuse is in central New York. So\
      \ the longitude of Syracuse would be west of the longitude of Cambridge, MA.\
      \ \n\nLet me check approximate longitudes. Cambridge, MA is around 71 degrees\
      \ west longitude. Syracuse, NY is around 76 degrees west longitude. Wait, no,\
      \ higher longitude west means further west. So 76W is west of 71W. So Syracuse\
      \ is at a more westerly longitude than MIT. Therefore, yes, Syracuse University\
      \ is located west of MIT. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should confirm the exact coordinates.\
      \ Let me think. MIT's coordinates are approximately 42.3601\xB0 N, 71.0921\xB0\
      \ W. Syracuse University is around 43.0379\xB0 N, 76.1317\xB0 W. Comparing the\
      \ longitudes: MIT is at 71.09\xB0W, Syracuse at 76.13\xB0W. Since longitude\
      \ increases as you go west, 76W is west of 71W. Therefore, Syracuse is indeed\
      \ west of MIT. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \nSyracuse University\
      \ in New York (longitude ~76.13\xB0W) is located west of MIT in Massachusetts\
      \ (longitude ~71.09\xB0W), as higher western longitude values indicate a more\
      \ westerly position."
    6517f681-4545-45cd-bd66-7da58131424b: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Syracuse University in New York is located west of MIT in Massachusetts.\
      \ Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where both universities are. MIT is in\
      \ Cambridge, Massachusetts. Syracuse University is in Syracuse, New York. So,\
      \ comparing their geographical positions. \n\nI know that Massachusetts is east\
      \ of New York state. Wait, no. Wait, New York is to the west of Massachusetts.\
      \ Because Massachusetts is on the east coast, and New York state is just to\
      \ the west of it. But wait, no, actually, Massachusetts is north of Connecticut\
      \ and Rhode Island, and New York state is to the west of Massachusetts. So,\
      \ Syracuse, being in upstate New York, would be west of Boston area where MIT\
      \ is. Let me think about the map.\n\nAlternatively, maybe check the longitude\
      \ coordinates. Places further west have higher longitude values (in the western\
      \ hemisphere, longitude is measured west from the prime meridian, which is negative\
      \ in the US). Wait no, longitude west of the prime meridian is measured in negative\
      \ degrees west? Wait, no, actually, in the US, longitude is west, so it's represented\
      \ as negative numbers. For example, New York City is around -74 degrees, while\
      \ Boston is around -71 degrees. So a more negative number (like -74) is further\
      \ west than -71. So Syracuse, NY would have a longitude. Let me check approximate\
      \ coordinates.\n\nMIT is in Cambridge, MA. Let's say Cambridge's coordinates\
      \ are approximately 42.36\xB0 N, 71.10\xB0 W. Syracuse University's coordinates\
      \ are around 43.04\xB0 N, 76.14\xB0 W. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, longitude for\
      \ Syracuse, NY is actually around 76.14\xB0 W, but wait, that can't be right\
      \ because New York City is about 74\xB0 W. Oh, wait, Syracuse is in upstate\
      \ New York, so it's actually more west than NYC. So if MIT is at 71.10\xB0 W,\
      \ and Syracuse is at 76.14\xB0 W, then Syracuse is further west. Because 76.14\
      \ is a larger number (more west) than 71.10. Wait, but since longitude west\
      \ is negative when using decimal degrees, so maybe that's a confusion. Wait,\
      \ no\u2014when we talk about longitude, 71.10\xB0 West is equivalent to -71.10\xB0\
      , and 76.14\xB0 West is -76.14\xB0. So, in terms of numerical value, -76.14\
      \ is less than -71.10 (since it's more negative). But when considering west\
      \ direction, the more westward location has a higher degree in the West. So,\
      \ 76\xB0W is further west than 71\xB0W, meaning Syracuse is west of MIT. Therefore,\
      \ the answer would be YES.\n</think>Syracuse University, NY (longitude ~76.14\xB0\
      W) is located west of MIT, MA (longitude ~71.10\xB0W), as a higher numerical\
      \ value in degrees West indicates a more westerly position. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    6d86fc2e-25ce-4df2-b1f6-9c8dd519038c: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user is asking if Syracuse University in New York is located west\
      \ of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Massachusetts. Hmm,\
      \ okay, first I need to figure out where each of these universities is situated\
      \ geographically.\n\nLet me start with Syracuse University. I know Syracuse\
      \ is a city in upstate New York. Upstate New York is generally the northern\
      \ part of the state, away from New York City. Syracuse is somewhere in the central\
      \ part of the state, I think. Maybe near the Finger Lakes region? I'm not exactly\
      \ sure of the exact coordinates, but I can recall that Syracuse is in central\
      \ New York State.\n\nNow, MIT is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Cambridge is right\
      \ next to Boston, which is on the eastern side of Massachusetts. Boston is a\
      \ major city on the coast, so Cambridge is going to be pretty far east in the\
      \ state. So MIT's location is in eastern Massachusetts, near the Atlantic Ocean.\n\
      \nThe next step is to compare their longitudes. Since the question is about\
      \ being west, longitude is key here. The further west a location is, the more\
      \ negative its longitude value (assuming we're using the standard where the\
      \ prime meridian is 0 degrees, and west longitudes are negative in the US).\
      \ \n\nLet me think... Syracuse, NY. Maybe I can approximate their longitudes.\
      \ Syracuse, NY's longitude is around 76 degrees west (I think it's approximately\
      \ -76.0). MIT in Cambridge, MA. Boston's longitude is about -71.06 degrees.\
      \ Let me confirm that. Wait, Boston is around 71 degrees west longitude. So\
      \ if Syracuse is at -76 and MIT is at -71, then Syracuse has a more negative\
      \ longitude, which means it's further west. Wait, no. Wait, longitude west is\
      \ measured as negative. So the more west you go, the more negative the number\
      \ becomes. So -76 is further west than -71 because -76 is smaller than -71.\
      \ Wait, numbers-wise, -76 is less than -71. So in terms of west, the longitude\
      \ becomes more negative as you go west. So yes, Syracuse being at around -76\
      \ would be west of MIT at -71. So Syracuse is west of MIT.\n\nBut I should verify\
      \ the exact coordinates. Let me check my memory. Syracuse University's coordinates:\
      \ According to a quick search, Syracuse, NY is at approximately 43.0389\xB0\
      \ N, 76.1353\xB0 W. MIT in Cambridge, MA is at 42.3601\xB0 N, 71.0942\xB0 W.\
      \ So Syracuse's longitude is -76.1353, and MIT's is -71.0942. Since -76.1353\
      \ is west of -71.0942 (because it's a lower number in the negative), that means\
      \ Syracuse is indeed west of MIT. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES\
      \  \nSyracuse University in New York has a longitude of approximately -76.1353\xB0\
      \ W, while MIT in Massachusetts is at -71.0942\xB0 W. Since lower (more negative)\
      \ longitude values indicate a location further west, Syracuse is west of MIT."
    818ea190-2aae-4b9f-9757-c6b7f144a5c6: "<think>Alright, let's see. The question\
      \ is asking if Syracuse University in New York is located west of the Massachusetts\
      \ Institute of Technology (MIT) in Massachusetts. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure\
      \ out the geographical locations of both places and determine which one is further\
      \ west.\n\nFirst, I should recall where these two universities are. Syracuse\
      \ University is in Syracuse, New York. MIT is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. So\
      \ I need to compare the longitude of Syracuse, NY, and Cambridge, MA. Since\
      \ the Earth is a sphere, longitude measures how far east or west a location\
      \ is. The higher the longitude (in the western hemisphere), the further west\
      \ it is.\n\nWait, but longitude can be a bit tricky. Let me remember that in\
      \ the United States, as you move from the east coast to the west coast, the\
      \ longitude becomes more negative if we're using the convention where the prime\
      \ meridian is 0\xB0, and west longitudes are negative. So, for example, New\
      \ York is around -73\xB0 longitude, and Massachusetts might be around -71\xB0\
      \ or something. If that's the case, a more negative longitude would mean further\
      \ west. So if Syracuse, NY has a longitude that's more west (more negative)\
      \ than Cambridge, MA, then the answer is yes.\n\nLet me check the approximate\
      \ coordinates. Syracuse, NY: I think it's in upstate New York, which is more\
      \ towards the western part of the state. Cambridge, MA is near Boston, which\
      \ is on the eastern side of Massachusetts. So maybe Syracuse is indeed west\
      \ of Boston. But I need to confirm the exact longitudes.\n\nLooking up Syracuse,\
      \ NY's longitude... according to my memory or general knowledge, Syracuse is\
      \ around 76\xB0 West longitude? Wait, or is that too far west? Wait, New York\
      \ City is about 74\xB0 W. Syracuse is further north and west in New York State.\
      \ So maybe around 76\xB0 W. And Cambridge, MA: Boston is around 71\xB0 W. So\
      \ Cambridge would be at approximately -71.1\xB0 longitude, and Syracuse at around\
      \ -76.2\xB0. Since -76.2 is more west (more negative) than -71.1, that means\
      \ Syracuse is west of MIT. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n\nBut wait,\
      \ let me make sure. Maybe I mixed up the numbers. Let me think again. For example,\
      \ Boston is at about 71\xB0W, so MIT in Cambridge is part of the Boston metro\
      \ area, so same longitude. Syracuse is in central New York, which is west of\
      \ Albany, which is the capital of NY. Albany is around 73.7\xB0W. So Syracuse\
      \ being further west than Albany would be around 76\xB0W. Therefore, Syracuse\
      \ is west of MIT. That makes sense because Massachusetts is east of New York\
      \ State, but Syracuse is in the western part of New York. Wait no, New York\
      \ State is to the west of Massachusetts. Wait, geographically, Massachusetts\
      \ is east of New York. So Boston (MIT) is in the eastern part of Massachusetts,\
      \ while Syracuse is in central New York, which is west of Massachusetts. So\
      \ yes, Syracuse would be west of MIT. So the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine\
      \ if Syracuse University, NY is west of MIT, MA:  \n1. **Locations**: Syracuse\

      \nWait, but wait, longitude in the US is measured in the western hemisphere,\

      \ west it is. Wait, no, actually, the more negative (i.e., the lower the numerical\

      \ are around 76 degrees west longitude. Maybe approximately 76.1\xB0 W. And\
      \ Cambridge, MA, where MIT is located, is near Boston. Boston's longitude is\
      \ around 71 degrees west. For example, Boston is roughly 71.06\xB0 W. So if\
      \ Syracuse is at 76\xB0 W and MIT is at 71\xB0 W, then Syracuse is further west\
      \ because 76 is more west than 71 (since the numbers are negative, -76 is less\

      \ coordinates are 42.3601\xB0 N, 71.0922\xB0 W. So Syracuse is at 76.1316\xB0\
      \ W and MIT at 71.0922\xB0 W. Since 76.1316 is a higher number than 71.0922\
      \ when both are west longitudes (which are negative, but in absolute terms),\
      \ Syracuse is further west. Because each degree of longitude west is moving\

      \ MIT.\n</think>Syracuse University, NY is located at approximately 76.13\xB0\

    f87a1759-b8f3-414e-925c-b82c1dc0ac11: "<think>Alright, let's see. The question\
      \ is whether Syracuse University in New York is located west of MIT in Massachusetts.\
      \ Hmm, okay, I need to figure out their geographical positions relative to each\
      \ other. \n\nFirst, I know that Syracuse University is in Syracuse, New York.\
      \ MIT is in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is part of the Boston area. So I\
      \ need to compare the longitudes of these two cities because longitude determines\
      \ east-west positioning. The further west a location is, the higher its longitude\
      \ value (in the western hemisphere). Wait, no, actually in the United States,\
      \ which is in the western hemisphere, longitude is measured west from the prime\
      \ meridian. So a higher longitude value (more west) would mean a location is\
      \ further west. \n\nLet me check the approximate longitudes. Syracuse, NY: I\
      \ think it's around 76\xB0W. For Cambridge, MA, which is near Boston, I believe\
      \ Boston's longitude is about 71\xB0W. If Syracuse is at 76\xB0W and MIT is\
      \ at 71\xB0W, then Syracuse is further west because 76 is greater than 71. So\
      \ yes, Syracuse would be west of MIT.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should confirm the\
      \ exact coordinates. Let me recall. Syracuse is in upstate New York, which is\
      \ to the west of Massachusetts. Massachusetts is east of New York state. So\
      \ Syracuse is in central New York, which is definitely west of Massachusetts.\
      \ Because Massachusetts is to the east of New York. Wait, no, Massachusetts\
      \ is to the east of New York State? Let me think. New York State is bordered\
      \ by Massachusetts to the east. Wait, actually, looking at a map, New York is\
      \ to the west of Massachusetts. For example, Albany, the capital of New York,\
      \ is east of Syracuse but still west of the Massachusetts border. So Syracuse\
      \ is in central New York, which is further west than the entire state of Massachusetts.\
      \ Therefore, yes, Syracuse University would be west of MIT in Massachusetts.\
      \ \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the cities. Cambridge, MA is near\
      \ Boston, on the east coast. Syracuse is in upstate New York, which is more\
      \ inland, so definitely west of Boston. So longitude-wise, Syracuse is west.\
      \ Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>To determine if Syracuse University,\

      \ So I need to find the longitude coordinates for both cities. \n\nI remember\
      \ that in the US, the western states have higher longitude values because longitude\

      \ bit west of Chicago maybe? Or east? Wait, no, Wisconsin is east of the Mississippi\
      \ River, but Madison is in southern Wisconsin. Let me check approximate coordinates.\n\
      \nFrom memory, UCLA's coordinates are approximately 34.05\xB0 N latitude, -118.25\xB0\
      \ W longitude. For the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, the College of\
      \ Engineering is part of the main campus in Madison. Madison's coordinates are\

      \ negative as you go west (because it's measured west from the prime meridian),\
      \ a more negative value means further west. So -118.25 is more west than -89.40.\
      \ Therefore, UCLA is indeed west of Madison, Wisconsin. \n\nWait, but let me\
      \ make sure I'm not mixing up the directions. If you have two points in the\

      \ by longitude. \n\nFirst, I know that UCLA is in Los Angeles, which is on the\
      \ west coast of the US. Wisconsin is in the Midwest, so Madison is probably\
      \ more to the east. But I should check the exact longitudes. \n\nLet me recall:\
      \ The US uses the western hemisphere longitudes, which are negative numbers.\
      \ The further west a location is, the more negative (or lower) its longitude.\

      \ think the state of Wisconsin is around 89\xB0 to 92\xB0 West longitude. For\
      \ example, Milwaukee is around 87\xB0 W, but Madison is a bit west of Milwaukee.\
      \ Wait, no, Milwaukee is on Lake Michigan, which is the eastern part of Wisconsin.\
      \ So Madison, being the state capital, is more inland. Let me think. Maybe Madison\
      \ is around 89\xB0 W? Or maybe 89.4\xB0 W? \n\nWait, I should be precise. Let\
      \ me recall: The University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison's coordinates. If I remember\
      \ correctly, the main campus is at approximately 43.0731\xB0 N, 89.4012\xB0\

      \ 34.0689\xB0 N, 118.4457\xB0 W. So that's around -118.45 degrees longitude.\
      \ \n\nComparing the two: UCLA is at -118.45, and UW-Madison is at -89.40. Since\
      \ longitude decreases as you go west, a more negative value means further west.\
      \ So -118 is more west than -89. Therefore, UCLA is indeed west of UW-Madison's\
      \ College of Engineering. \n\nWait, but the question specifies the College of\

      \ main university campus in Madison. So the coordinates would be the same. Therefore,\
      \ the answer should be yes. \n\nSo the steps are: check longitudes of both institutions.\
      \ UCLA is at around 118\xB0W, UW-Madison at 89\xB0W. Since 118 is west of 89,\
      \ the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \nThe University of California, Los Angeles\

      \ 89 degrees West. Wait, yes, because Chicago is around 87 degrees West, and\
      \ Madison is a bit west of Chicago. Maybe Madison is around 89\xB0W. If that's\
      \ the case, then Los Angeles at 118\xB0W would be west of Madison. \n\nBut wait,\
      \ I should double-check. Maybe I'm mixing up the exact numbers. Let me think.\
      \ The University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison's College of Engineering is part\
      \ of the main campus in Madison, WI. The coordinates for Madison, WI are approximately\
      \ 43.0731\xB0 N, 89.4012\xB0 W. And UCLA is in Los Angeles, CA, which has coordinates\
      \ around 34.0522\xB0 N, 118.2437\xB0 W. \n\nComparing the longitudes: UCLA is\
      \ at 118.2437\xB0 W, and Madison is at 89.4012\xB0 W. Since longitude increases\
      \ as you go west (but in negative degrees, so lower numbers are less west).\
      \ Wait, no, actually, when considering west longitude, a higher numerical value\
      \ (more negative) means further west. So 118\xB0W is further west than 89\xB0\
      W. Therefore, UCLA is indeed west of UW-Madison. \n\nSo the answer should be\
      \ YES, because UCLA's longitude is more west than that of the University of\

      \ question is asking if UCLA in Los Angeles, California is located west of the\
      \ University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison College of Engineering in Wisconsin.\n\
      \nFirst, I need to know where each of these universities is located. UCLA is\
      \ in Los Angeles, CA. The University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison is in Madison,\
      \ Wisconsin. The College of Engineering is part of UW-Madison, so it's in the\
      \ same city, Madison.\n\nNext, I should compare their longitudes because east\
      \ and west directions are determined by longitude. The further west a location\
      \ is (higher negative longitude if we're using the convention where west is\
      \ negative in the US), the more west it is.\n\nLet me recall the approximate\
      \ longitudes. Los Angeles is on the west coast. I think its longitude is around\
      \ -118.4 degrees. Madison, Wisconsin is in the Midwest. I'm not exactly sure\
      \ of its longitude, but maybe around -89.4 degrees. Wait, is that right? Let\
      \ me think. Chicago is around -87.6, so Madison being a bit west of Chicago\
      \ might be around -89.5. Let me confirm that. Yeah, Madison, WI's longitude\
      \ is approximately -89.4 degrees. So UCLA's longitude is -118.4, which is more\
      \ west than -89.4. So UCLA is indeed west of UW-Madison.\n\nWait, but longitude\
      \ lines go from 0 at the prime meridian, and west longitudes are negative. So\
      \ the more negative the number, the further west. So -118 is more west than\
      \ -89. Therefore, UCLA is west of Madison, WI. So the answer should be YES.\n\
      </think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Identify Locations:** \
      \ \n   - UCLA is in Los Angeles, California.  \n   - University of Wisconsin\u2013\

      \  \n\n3. **Conclusion:**  \n   Since -118.4\xB0 is west of -89.4\xB0, UCLA\

      \ UCLA in Los Angeles, CA is west of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison\
      \ College of Engineering in Wisconsin. Let me start by recalling where these\
      \ two places are located. \n\nFirst, UCLA is in Los Angeles, California. I know\
      \ that California is on the west coast of the United States. Los Angeles is\
      \ a major city there, so its longitude must be pretty far west. On the other\
      \ hand, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison is in Madison, Wisconsin. Wisconsin\
      \ is in the Midwest, north of Illinois and along Lake Michigan. Madison is the\
      \ capital city of Wisconsin.\n\nNow, I need to compare their longitudes because\
      \ that determines how far west they are. The further west the longitude (i.e.,\
      \ the higher the negative number if we're using the convention where west longitudes\
      \ are negative), the more west the location is. So I should find the approximate\
      \ longitudes of both universities.\n\nStarting with UCLA. Los Angeles is known\
      \ to be around 34 degrees latitude north and 118 degrees longitude west. Let\
      \ me verify that. A quick check in my mind: major cities in California like\
      \ LA, San Francisco. San Francisco is around 122\xB0W, LA is a bit east of that,\
      \ so maybe 118\xB0W. So UCLA would be approximately 118.4 degrees west longitude,\
      \ maybe? \n\nNow, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison's College of Engineering.\
      \ Madison, Wisconsin. The approximate coordinates for Madison, WI. I think Madison\
      \ is around 43 degrees north latitude, and longitude... maybe 89 degrees west?\
      \ Because Chicago is around 87\xB0W, so Madison being a bit west of Chicago\
      \ would be around 89\xB0W. Let me confirm that. Yes, Madison, WI is approximately\
      \ 43.07\xB0N, 89.40\xB0W. So the longitude is about -89.4 degrees.\n\nSo UCLA\
      \ is at around -118.4 degrees longitude, and UW-Madison's College of Engineering\
      \ is at around -89.4 degrees. Since longitude decreases as you go east, a more\
      \ negative number (like -118) is further west than a less negative one (like\
      \ -89). Therefore, UCLA is west of UW-Madison.\n\nWait, but let me make sure.\
      \ If you have two longitudes, say 118\xB0W and 89\xB0W, the one with the higher\
      \ numerical value west (i.e., 118 is more than 89) is further west. So yes,\
      \ 118\xB0W is west of 89\xB0W. Because each degree of longitude west adds as\
      \ you go west. So a place at 118W is further west than 89W. So UCLA is indeed\
      \ west of UW-Madison's College of Engineering.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step\
      \ Explanation:**  \n1. **Locations Identification:**  \n   - UCLA is in Los\
      \ Angeles, CA (approx. longitude 118.4\xB0W).  \n   - UW\u2013Madison College\
      \ of Engineering is in Madison, WI (approx. longitude 89.4\xB0W).  \n\n2. **Longitude\
      \ Comparison:**  \n   - A more westerly longitude (higher numerical value in\

      \ Boston. But wait, that seems correct because Boston is in the northeast, so\
      \ moving from Boston to Philadelphia you go southwest? Or maybe not. Let me\
      \ visualize a map.\n\nLooking at the US East Coast: Boston is in the far northeast\

      \ I go from Boston to NYC, that's southwest, and then from NYC to Philly, that's\

      \ east-west, longitude-wise, Boston is at approximately 71\xB0W, and Philadelphia\
      \ is around 75\xB0W. Wait, but longitude decreases as you go west? No, wait,\
      \ no. Longitude increases as you go east. Wait, no, longitude is measured from\
      \ the prime meridian (0\xB0), going east to 180\xB0E and west to 180\xB0W. But\
      \ in the US, all locations are west of the prime meridian, so they are in the\

      \ PA, with a longitude of approximately -75.1\xB0. Northeastern University is\
      \ in Boston, MA, with a longitude of approximately -71.0\xB0. Since -75.1\xB0\
      \ is further west than -71.0\xB0, **UPenn is indeed west of Northeastern University**.\n\
      \nANSWER: YES"
    a61c820c-e554-4229-b26e-f5627b5a4ccf: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ asking if the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) in Pennsylvania is located\
      \ west of Northeastern University in Massachusetts. Hmm, I need to figure out\
      \ the geographical locations of both universities and compare their longitudes.\
      \ Since the question is about east-west positioning, longitude is the key here.\
      \ Places with higher longitude (more to the east) are further east, while those\
      \ with lower longitude are further west.\n\nFirst, I should determine where\
      \ each university is located. The University of Pennsylvania is in Philadelphia,\
      \ PA. Northeastern University is in Boston, MA. So I need the coordinates for\
      \ Philadelphia and Boston. \n\nI remember that Philadelphia is in southeastern\
      \ Pennsylvania, near New Jersey and Delaware. Boston is on the coast of Massachusetts,\
      \ which is in the northeastern part of the US. Generally, I think Boston is\
      \ more to the east than Philadelphia because it's further north along the coast.\
      \ But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think about the approximate longitudes.\n\n\
      From what I recall, Boston's longitude is around -71 degrees west. Philadelphia\
      \ is around -75 degrees west. Wait, longitude lines run north to south, so a\
      \ more negative (lower) number would mean it's further west. For example, New\
      \ York City is around -74 degrees, so Philly at -75 would be just west of NYC.\
      \ Boston, being further east than NYC, has a longitude around -71. So if Philly\
      \ is -75 and Boston is -71, that means Philly is west of Boston? Wait, no. Because\
      \ lower longitude (more negative) actually is further west. So -75 is further\
      \ west than -71. So Philadelphia is west of Boston. Therefore, UPenn (in Philly)\
      \ would be west of Northeastern (in Boston). So the answer is YES.\n\nWait,\
      \ let me confirm. Let me look up the exact coordinates. Philadelphia, PA: Latitude:\
      \ 39.9526\xB0 N, Longitude: -75.1652\xB0 W. Boston, MA: Latitude: 42.3601\xB0\
      \ N, Longitude: -71.0589\xB0 W. Comparing the longitudes: Philadelphia is at\
      \ -75.1652, Boston at -71.0589. Since lower longitude (more negative) means\
      \ further west. So -75 is west of -71. Therefore, UPenn is indeed west of Northeastern\
      \ University. So the answer is YES.\n</think>The University of Pennsylvania\
      \ (Penn) is located in Philadelphia, PA, with a longitude of approximately -75.1652\xB0\
      \ W. Northeastern University is in Boston, MA, with a longitude of approximately\

      \ further west, Philadelphia (\u221275.1652\xB0 W) is west of Boston (\u2212\
      71.0589\xB0 W). \n\nANSWER: YES"
    aab695d9-15ad-40bf-9245-1a9a3d552ce8: "<think>Okay, let me see. The question is\
      \ whether the University of Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania is located west of\
      \ Northeastern University in Massachusetts. Hmm, I need to figure out their\
      \ geographic locations and compare their longitudes, because \"west\" would\
      \ mean a lower longitude (more to the left on a map).\n\nFirst, I should recall\
      \ where these universities are. The University of Pennsylvania, UPenn, is in\
      \ Philadelphia, PA. Northeastern University is in Boston, MA. So I need to compare\
      \ the locations of Philadelphia and Boston.\n\nWait, Philadelphia is a major\
      \ city in southeastern Pennsylvania, right? And Boston is in the eastern part\
      \ of Massachusetts. Both are on the East Coast, but I think Boston is more north\
      \ and east. But does that mean Philadelphia is west of Boston? Let me visualize\
      \ a map. If you look at the East Coast, Boston is in the northeast, like the\
      \ top right part of the US. Philadelphia is south of New York City, which is\
      \ south of Boston. But in terms of east-west direction, perhaps Philadelphia\
      \ is a bit to the west of Boston because Boston is more towards the east coast's\
      \ northern part, while Philadelphia is further south but maybe slightly west?\
      \ Or maybe they're both around the same longitude?\n\nI might need to check\
      \ their approximate longitudes. Let me think. Boston's longitude is around 71\
      \ degrees west, maybe. Philadelphia's longitude is around 75 degrees west? Wait,\
      \ longitude increases as you go west, but in the US, the eastern cities have\
      \ longitudes like 70s. Wait, no, longitude west of the prime meridian goes from\
      \ 0 to 180 west. So cities on the East Coast have lower longitudes (like 70s)\
      \ compared to cities further west. For example, New York City is about 74 degrees\
      \ west. Boston is more east, so maybe around 71 degrees west. Philadelphia is\
      \ in PA, which is south and west of New York. So Philadelphia's longitude might\
      \ be around 75 degrees west? Wait, wait, no. Wait, New York City is about 74\xB0\
      \ W. Philadelphia is slightly south and west of NYC. So maybe Philadelphia's\
      \ longitude is around 75.1\xB0 W, while Boston is around 71.0\xB0 W. If that's\
      \ the case, then Philadelphia is further west (higher longitude west) than Boston,\
      \ so UPenn would be west of Northeastern. But I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe I'm mixing up the directions. Since Boston is to the east, its longitude\
      \ would be a smaller number (since moving east from prime meridian towards the\
      \ US, the longitude becomes west but numerically lower). Wait, the Prime Meridian\
      \ is 0\xB0, going west, the longitude increases. So for example, London is around\
      \ 0\xB0, New York is around 74\xB0 W, which means 74 degrees west of the Prime\
      \ Meridian. Boston, being east of New York, would have a longitude of around\
      \ 71\xB0 W, right? And Philadelphia is west of NYC, so maybe 75\xB0 W. So yes,\
      \ in that case, Philadelphia would be west of Boston, meaning UPenn is west\
      \ of Northeastern U. So the answer would be YES.\n\nWait, but I should make\
      \ sure. Let me think again. If you look at a map of the US East Coast, Boston\
      \ is in Massachusetts, on the coast. Moving south along the coast, you hit New\
      \ York City (which is around 74\xB0 W), then further south is Philadelphia,\
      \ PA. But does moving south along the coast also mean moving west? For example,\
      \ Boston is at approximately 42\xB0 N, 71\xB0 W. New York City is around 40.7\xB0\
      \ N, 74\xB0 W. Philadelphia is around 39.9\xB0 N, 75.1\xB0 W. So Boston's longitude\
      \ is 71, NYC 74, Philly 75. So Philly is indeed west of Boston. Therefore, UPenn\
      \ (Philadelphia) is west of Northeastern (Boston). So the answer is YES.\n</think>The\
      \ University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA) is located at approximately\
      \ **75.2\xB0 W** longitude, while Northeastern University (Boston, MA) is around\
      \ **71.1\xB0 W** longitude. Since lower longitude values are further east, Philadelphia\
      \ (UPenn) lies west of Boston (Northeastern). \n\n**ANSWER: YES**"
    c9076c59-1455-4a34-8c1f-60a103d4e7b2: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the University of Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania is located west of\

      \ University is in Boston, MA. So I need to determine the longitude of both\
      \ cities. Since the question is about east-west positioning, longitude is the\
      \ key here. The further west a location is, the higher the Western the Western\
      \ the Western Hemisphere, but wait, longitude west is measured as negative in\
      \ some systems). Wait, actually, in the US, longitude is west of the Prime Meridian,\
      \ so higher numerical value (when considered as negative numbers) would mean\
      \ further west. For example, if one city is at -75 degrees and another at -71\
      \ degrees, the one at -75 is further west because -75 is less than -71, but\
      \ in terms of absolute position west, it's more west.\n\nWait, maybe I should\
      \ clarify. Let me recall: Longitude is measured from 0\xB0 at the Prime Meridian\
      \ (Greenwich, UK) going east to 180\xB0 and west to -180\xB0. So for locations\
      \ in the US, which are west of the Prime Meridian, their longitudes are negative\
      \ in the decimal system. So Philadelphia's longitude and Boston's longitude\u2014\
      I need to compare them. \n\nPhiladelphia, PA: I think it's around 75 degrees\
      \ west longitude. Let me check in my mind. Philadelphia is on the eastern part\
      \ of Pennsylvania, which is in the Eastern Time Zone. Boston is in Massachusetts,\
      \ also Eastern Time. But even within the same time zone, there can be differences\
      \ in longitude. For example, the Eastern Time Zone roughly spans from 67.5\xB0\
      W to 87.5\xB0W, I think. But cities on the east coast have more easterly longitudes.\
      \ So Boston is further east than Philadelphia? Wait, no. Wait, Boston is north\
      \ and east. Let me think: If you look at a map of the US east coast, Boston\
      \ is in the northeast, Massachusetts is north of Pennsylvania. But Philadelphia\
      \ is south of New York City, which is south of Boston. So geographically, Boston\
      \ is further east? Wait, maybe not. Let me visualize: New York City is around\
      \ 74\xB0W, Boston is around 71\xB0W, and Philadelphia is around 75\xB0W. Wait,\
      \ if that's the case, then Philadelphia (75\xB0W) is west of Boston (71\xB0\
      W). Because lower longitude (more negative) means further west. Wait, but longitude\
      \ west is often expressed as positive with a W suffix. So if Philadelphia is\
      \ 75\xB0W, that's equivalent to -75\xB0, and Boston is  (-71\xB0). (-71\xB0\
      ). So since -75\xB0 is west of -71\xB0, Philadelphia is indeed west of Boston.\
      \ Therefore, UPenn is west of Northeastern University. So the answer would be\
      \ YES.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm the actual longitudes. Let me recall specific\
      \ coordinates. Philadelphia's coordinates are approximately 39.95\xB0N latitude,\
      \ 75.15\xB0W longitude. Boston is approximately 42.36\xB0N, 71.06\xB0W. So Philadelphia's\
      \ longitude is 75.15\xB0W, Boston is 71.06\xB0W. Since 75.15\xB0W is further\
      \ west than 71.06\xB0W, UPenn is west of Northeastern. Therefore, the answer\
      \ is YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Identify Locations:**\

    cb53a4d5-e901-43fd-9fff-e18c858ed7ed: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the University of Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania is located west of\
      \ Northeastern University in Massachusetts. Hmm, I need to figure out the geographic\
      \ locations of both universities and compare their longitudes. Since west means\
      \ a lower longitude (more to the left on a map), whichever has a lower longitude\
      \ would be further west.\n\nFirst, I should recall where each university is.\
      \ The University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) is in Philadelphia, PA. Northeastern\
      \ University is in Boston, MA. Now, I need to find the approximate longitudes\
      \ of these two cities. \n\nPhiladelphia is in southeastern Pennsylvania. I remember\
      \ that Philadelphia is near the Delaware River, not too far from the Atlantic\
      \ coast, but maybe a bit inland. Boston is on the coast of Massachusetts, so\
      \ it's definitely on the eastern side. But how do their longitudes compare?\n\
      \nLet me think. The prime meridian is 0\xB0, and the US is in the western hemisphere,\
      \ so longitudes are negative. For example, New York City is around -74\xB0 longitude.\
      \ Boston is northeast of NYC, so its longitude should be a bit higher (less\
      \ negative) than NYC. Wait, no. Actually, moving east increases longitude. So\
      \ Boston is east of NYC, which would mean Boston's longitude is a bit more east\
      \ (closer to -71 or so), while Philadelphia is south of NYC. Wait, Philadelphia\
      \ is southwest of NYC. So maybe Philadelphia's longitude is a bit west of NYC's.\
      \ Let me check approximate coordinates.\n\nLooking up from memory: New York\
      \ City is approximately 40.7\xB0N, 74.0\xB0W. Philadelphia is around 39.95\xB0\
      N, 75.16\xB0W. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up. Let\
      \ me think again. If NYC is at about 74\xB0W, then Philadelphia, being to the\
      \ southwest, might be a bit further west. Wait, but Philadelphia is actually\
      \ south of NYC, but not necessarily west. Wait, maybe I should visualize a map.\
      \ NYC is on the east coast, and Philadelphia is a bit south along the coast.\
      \ So maybe their longitudes are similar. But Boston is north of NYC, so maybe\
      \ its longitude is a bit more east. Wait, no. Longitude lines run north-south.\
      \ So moving east or west affects longitude, not latitude. So if Boston is to\
      \ the east of NYC, its longitude would be a higher number (less negative). For\
      \ example, NYC is around 74\xB0W, Boston is around 71\xB0W. So Boston is at\
      \ a longitude of approximately -71.0\xB0, while Philadelphia is around -75.2\xB0\
      W. Wait, that would mean Philadelphia is west of Boston. But wait, I need to\
      \ confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should recall that the east coast cities\
      \ have longitudes decreasing as you go north. For example, Miami is around 80\xB0\
      W, Atlanta is around 84\xB0W (but that's inland). Wait, no, that's not right.\
      \ Wait, longitude decreases as you go west. So cities further east have higher\
      \ longitudes (closer to 0). So Boston is further east than Philadelphia. Therefore,\
      \ Boston's longitude is less negative (e.g., -71\xB0 vs. Philadelphia's -75\xB0\
      ). If that's the case, then Philadelphia is west of Boston. So UPenn (in Philly)\
      \ would be west of Northeastern (in Boston). Therefore, the answer is YES.\n\
      \nWait, but I need to make sure. Let me think of specific coordinates. Let me\
      \ check approximate coordinates for both cities. \n\nPhiladelphia, PA: Latitude:\
      \ 39.9526\xB0 N, Longitude: 75.1652\xB0 W.\n\nBoston, MA: Latitude: 42.3601\xB0\
      \ N, Longitude: 71.0589\xB0 W.\n\nSo comparing the longitudes: Philadelphia\
      \ is at 75.1652\xB0W, Boston at 71.0589\xB0W. Since 75.1652 is more west (higher\
      \ in negative terms), that means Philadelphia is west of Boston. Therefore,\
      \ UPenn is indeed west of Northeastern University. So the answer is YES.\n</think>The\
