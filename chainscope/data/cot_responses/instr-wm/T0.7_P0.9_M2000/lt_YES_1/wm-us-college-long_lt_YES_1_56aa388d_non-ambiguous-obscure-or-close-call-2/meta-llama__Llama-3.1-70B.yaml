    180b184f-171c-4d5c-9b79-a0baa7fb4ab0: 'To answer this question,
      let''s break down the locations of both universities.


      1. **University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)** is located in San Francisco,
      California. California is on the West Coast of the United States.


      2. **Boston University** is located in Boston, Massachusetts. Massachusetts
      is on the East Coast of the United States.


      Given these locations:

      - UCSF is on the West Coast (California).

      - Boston University is on the East Coast (Massachusetts).


      Considering the geographical layout of the United States:

      - The West Coast (where California is located) is west of the East Coast (where
      Massachusetts is located).


      Since UCSF is on the West Coast and Boston University is on the East Coast,
      we can conclude that UCSF is located west of Boston University.


      The final answer is: YES
