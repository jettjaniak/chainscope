    f3d32b94-2fc5-4a15-9db8-cef809241d55: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) UCLA is located in Los Angeles, California, on the west coast of the United
      States


      2) University of Wisconsin-Madison is located in Madison, Wisconsin, in the
      Midwest region of the United States


      3) Looking at a US map:

      - California is on the Pacific coast

      - Wisconsin is several states east of California, near the Great Lakes


      4) Therefore, UCLA (in California) must be west of UW-Madison (in Wisconsin)

      - University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

      - Northeastern University is in Boston, Massachusetts


      2. Now, let me consider the geographical positions:

      - Philadelphia is located west of Boston

      - Therefore, UPenn (in Philadelphia) is west of Northeastern (in Boston)


      NO is not the answer, because UPenn is indeed west of Northeastern.
