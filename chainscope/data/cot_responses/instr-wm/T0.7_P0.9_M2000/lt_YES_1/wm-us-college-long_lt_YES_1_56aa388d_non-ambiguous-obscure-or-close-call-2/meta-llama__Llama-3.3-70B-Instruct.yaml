      2. **Understand geographical locations**: Illinois is generally considered to
      be in the Midwest of the United States, while Georgia is in the Southeast.


      3. **Compare the locations**: When comparing their positions in the United States,

      University, NY is located west of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MA,
      let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Syracuse University is located in Syracuse, New
      York, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is located in Cambridge,
      Massachusetts.


      2. **Understand the geography**: Massachusetts is located east of New York.
      This is because the general geography of the United States has the states along
      the East Coast listed from north to south (or vice versa) as Maine, New Hampshire,
      Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, etc. Thus, Massachusetts
      is directly east of New York when considering their general positions.


      3. **Consider the specific cities**: Cambridge, MA (where MIT is located), and
      Syracuse, NY. Massachusetts is generally to the east of New York, and since
      Syracuse is in the central part of New York State, it is still west of the easternmost
      parts of Massachusetts.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given the general east-west positioning of the states (Massachusetts
      to the east of New York), and considering the locations of the two universities
      within their respective states, Syracuse University in New York would be west
      of MIT in Massachusetts.


      The final answer is: YES'

      of east-west orientation.

    d0eadb30-7ecf-4fff-a224-03029340393b: '<think></think>To answer this question,
      let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Identify the location of University of Pennsylvania (PA):** The University
      of Pennsylvania is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is considered
      part of the Northeastern United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Northeastern University (MA):** Northeastern University
      is located in Boston, Massachusetts. Massachusetts is also considered part of
      the Northeastern United States.


      3. **Compare the locations in terms of "west":** Since both universities are
      in the Northeast, we need to determine their relative positions. Pennsylvania
      is west of Massachusetts. Therefore, Philadelphia, PA (where the University
      of Pennsylvania is located) is west of Boston, MA (where Northeastern University
      is located).


      Based on the steps above, the answer to whether the University of Pennsylvania,
      PA is located west of Northeastern University, MA is: **YES**.'

      \ eastern part of Massachusetts, near the coast.\n\n4. **Compare the longitudes**\
      \ (since we are comparing east-west positions):\n   - Philadelphia, PA, has\
      \ a longitude of approximately 75.16\xB0 W.\n   - Boston, MA, has a longitude\
