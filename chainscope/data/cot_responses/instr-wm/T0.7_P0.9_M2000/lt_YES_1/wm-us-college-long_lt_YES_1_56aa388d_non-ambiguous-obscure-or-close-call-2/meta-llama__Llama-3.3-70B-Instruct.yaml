      2. **Understand geographical locations**: Illinois is generally considered to
      be in the Midwest of the United States, while Georgia is in the Southeast.


      3. **Compare the locations**: When comparing their positions in the United States,
      Georgia is east of Illinois. This is because the United States is often divided

      pass through the Southeast (where Georgia is) before reaching the Midwest (where

      4. **Determine the directional relationship**: Since Illinois is west of Georgia,

    d0eadb30-7ecf-4fff-a224-03029340393b: 'To answer this question,
      let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Identify the location of University of Pennsylvania (PA):** The University
      of Pennsylvania is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is considered
      part of the Northeastern United States.


      2. **Identify the location of Northeastern University (MA):** Northeastern University
      is located in Boston, Massachusetts. Massachusetts is also considered part of
      the Northeastern United States.


      3. **Compare the locations in terms of "west":** Since both universities are
      in the Northeast, we need to determine their relative positions. Pennsylvania
      is west of Massachusetts. Therefore, Philadelphia, PA (where the University
      of Pennsylvania is located) is west of Boston, MA (where Northeastern University
      is located).


      Based on the steps above, the answer to whether the University of Pennsylvania,
      PA is located west of Northeastern University, MA is: **YES**.'
