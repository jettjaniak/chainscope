      positions of University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and Boston University
      (BU).


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - UCSF is located in San Francisco, California, on the west coast of the United
      States.

      - Boston University is located in Boston, Massachusetts, on the east coast of
      the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their geographic positions.

      - The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic
      Ocean (east).

      - California is a west coast state, bordering the Pacific Ocean.

      - Massachusetts is an east coast state, bordering the Atlantic Ocean.

      - San Francisco is on the western edge of California.

      - Boston is on the eastern edge of Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      - Since San Francisco is on the west coast and Boston is on the east coast,
      San Francisco is west of Boston.

      - Therefore, UCSF (in San Francisco) is west of Boston University (in Boston).


      YES, University of California, San Francisco is located west of Boston University.'

      - New York state is generally west of Massachusetts

      - Massachusetts is on the eastern coast of the United States


      Step 3: Look more specifically at Syracuse and Cambridge.

      - Syracuse is in central/western New York state

      - Cambridge is in eastern Massachusetts, near Boston


      Step 4: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - Syracuse, NY is definitely west of Cambridge, MA

      - Syracuse is further inland, while Cambridge/MIT is closer to the Atlantic
      coast


      Therefore, YES, Syracuse University is located west of Massachusetts Institute

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
      (PA).

      - Northeastern University is located in Boston, Massachusetts (MA).


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions.

      - In the United States, Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts.

      - Specifically, Philadelphia (where UPenn is) is west of Boston (where Northeastern
      is).


      Step 3: Compare the locations on an east-west axis.

      - Moving from east to west across the US eastern seaboard: Boston comes before
      Philadelphia.

      - This means Philadelphia (and UPenn) is west of Boston (and Northeastern).


      NO.


      Wait, I made an error in my conclusion. Let me correct this:


      YES, University of Pennsylvania is located west of Northeastern University.'
