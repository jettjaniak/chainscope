      Bay Area. This places Stanford University on the west coast of the United States.


      Johns Hopkins University is in Maryland (MD), specifically in Baltimore, MD,
      which is on the east coast of the United States.


      The United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean
      (east). California is on the Pacific coast (west coast), while Maryland is on
      the Atlantic coast (east coast).


      Looking at a map of the United States:

      - California is on the far west of the country

      - Maryland is on the east of the country


      So geographically, Stanford University (in California) is located west of Johns
      Hopkins University (in Maryland).</think>To answer this question, I need to
      determine the geographic locations of both universities and compare them.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Stanford University is located in Stanford, California, which is in the San
      Francisco Bay Area on the west coast of the United States.

      - Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland, which is on the
      east coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare the relative positions.

      - California is on the western side of the United States, bordering the Pacific
      Ocean.

      - Maryland is on the eastern side of the United States, near the Atlantic Ocean.

      - The United States spans from west (Pacific Ocean) to east (Atlantic Ocean).


      Step 3: Make the determination.

      Since California is on the west coast and Maryland is on the east coast, Stanford
      University is indeed located west of Johns Hopkins University.


      YES'

      2. Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland (MD), which is

      3. In terms of US geography, the west coast (California) is west of the east

      4. Therefore, Stanford University (in California) is located west of Johns Hopkins
      University (in Maryland).</think>To determine if Stanford University is west

      - Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland (MD).


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the United States.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Maryland is on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis.

      - Moving from east to west across the US, you would encounter Maryland before
      California.

      - California is approximately 2,500 miles west of Maryland.


      Therefore, YES, Stanford University in California is located west of Johns Hopkins
      University in Maryland.'

      Now I need to consider their positions relative to each other on a map of the
      United States:


      - California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Maryland is on the east coast of the United States.

      - When traveling from east to west across the United States, you would encounter
      Maryland first, then California

      - Therefore, California is west of Maryland


      Step 4: Apply this to the universities.

      - Since Stanford is in California and Johns Hopkins is in Maryland, Stanford
      must be west of Johns Hopkins

      - Tennessee is west of Virginia

      - Virginia is on the eastern coast of the United States

      - Tennessee is more inland and further west


      Since Vanderbilt University is in Tennessee, and Virginia Tech is in Virginia,
      and Tennessee is west of Virginia, it follows that Vanderbilt University would
      be west of Virginia Tech.


      To be more specific:

      - Vanderbilt University is located in Nashville, Tennessee

      - Virginia Tech is located in Blacksburg, Virginia

      - Nashville, TN is definitely west of Blacksburg, VA on a map of the United

      - Vanderbilt University is located in Nashville, Tennessee

      - Virginia Tech is located in Blacksburg, Virginia


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - Tennessee lies to the west of Virginia on the US map

      - Virginia is on the eastern side of the United States, while Tennessee is more
      inland


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations within these states.

      - Nashville, TN (Vanderbilt) is in the central part of Tennessee

      - Blacksburg, VA (Virginia Tech) is in the western part of Virginia


      Step 4: Despite Blacksburg being in western Virginia, Tennessee as a whole state
      is still west of Virginia. Nashville, Tennessee is definitely west of Blacksburg,
      Virginia.


      YES, Vanderbilt University in Tennessee is located west of Virginia Tech in

      Step 1: Recall the locations

      - Vanderbilt University is in Nashville, Tennessee

      - Virginia Tech is in Blacksburg, Virginia


      Step 2: Recall the relative positions of Tennessee and Virginia

      Tennessee is west of Virginia in the United States. On a map of the US, Tennessee

      First, let me consider the locations:

      - Northwestern University is in Evanston, Illinois, which is in the midwestern
      United States

      - University of Georgia is in Athens, Georgia, which is in the southeastern
      United States


      Now I need to determine if Northwestern is west of the University of Georgia.
      On a map of the United States:

      - Illinois is generally west of Georgia

      - The midwest region (where Illinois is) is west of the southeast region (where
      Georgia is)


      Even though Northwestern is in the northern part of Illinois (Evanston, near
      Chicago), and the University of Georgia is in the eastern part of Georgia (Athens),
      the entire state of Illinois is west of the entire state of Georgia.


      So Northwestern University is indeed west of the University of Georgia.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative east-west positions of

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Northwestern University is located in Evanston, Illinois, which is in the
      Chicago metropolitan area.

      - University of Georgia is located in Athens, Georgia, which is in the eastern
      part of Georgia.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Illinois and Georgia.

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States.

      - Georgia is in the Southeast region of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes (east-west positions).

      - Illinois is positioned further west than Georgia on the US map.

      - Even though Northwestern is in the eastern part of Illinois (near Lake Michigan),
      Illinois as a whole is still west of Georgia.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - When comparing the actual longitude coordinates, Northwestern University is

      longitudes.


      Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States, while Georgia is in
      the Southeast region.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Illinois is roughly in the middle of the country, but more toward the eastern
      half

      - Georgia is on the eastern coast, in the southeast


      In terms of east-west positioning, Illinois is west of Georgia. Since Northwestern
      University is in Illinois and University of Georgia is in Georgia, Northwestern

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - Georgia is in the Southeast region, closer to the Atlantic coast


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - Illinois is positioned further west than Georgia

      - On a US map, Illinois sits to the west of Georgia


      Since Northwestern University is in Illinois, and University of Georgia is in
      Georgia, the former is located west of the latter.


      YES, Northwestern University, IL is located west of University of Georgia, GA.'

      To determine which is further west, I need to compare their approximate longitudes:

      - Illinois is generally around 87-91 degrees West longitude

      - Georgia is generally around 81-85 degrees West longitude


      Since lower numbers of West longitude indicate locations further east (and higher
      numbers indicate locations further west), Illinois is west of Georgia.


      More specifically:

      - Northwestern University in Evanston, IL is at approximately 87.7 degrees West
      longitude

      - University of Georgia in Athens, GA is at approximately 83.4 degrees West

      - Illinois is generally between 87-91 degrees West longitude.

      - Georgia is generally between 81-85 degrees West longitude.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since Illinois has a higher west longitude than Georgia, and Northwestern University

      Then I need to compare their geographic locations to determine if UT Austin
      is west of Duke.


      The University of Texas at Austin is located in Austin, Texas, which is in the
      central-south part of the United States. Texas is in the southwestern United
      States.


      Duke University is located in Durham, North Carolina, which is on the eastern

      North Carolina borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east, while Texas is several

      States


      Looking at a US map, Texas is positioned significantly west of North Carolina.
      North Carolina borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast, while Texas is
      much further inland and extends toward the central part of the country.

      immediately to the west of Massachusetts. However, I need to be careful because
      the specific locations within each state matter.


      Syracuse, NY is in the central part of New York state.

      MIT is in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is in the eastern part of Massachusetts
      near Boston.


      Given that New York is west of Massachusetts, and Syracuse is in central New
      York, while MIT is in eastern Massachusetts, it''s highly likely that Syracuse
      University is west of MIT.</think># Is Syracuse University, NY located west
      of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MA?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positions of these two universities.


      Let me think about their locations:


      1. Syracuse University is located in Syracuse, New York, which is in the central
      part of New York state.


      2. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
      which is in the eastern part of Massachusetts near Boston.


      3. Geographically, New York state is positioned west of Massachusetts.


      4. Since Syracuse is in central New York, and MIT is in eastern Massachusetts,
      Syracuse University must be further west than MIT.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      Syracuse University is located in Syracuse, New York.

      Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.


      To determine if Syracuse University is west of MIT, I need to consider their
      relative positions on a map of the United States.


      New York state is generally west of Massachusetts state. However, I need to
      be more precise about the specific locations of these cities.


      Syracuse is in central New York state.

      Cambridge is in eastern Massachusetts, near Boston.


      On a map of the northeastern United States, locations further west have lower

      Cambridge, Massachusetts.


      So Syracuse University is indeed west of MIT.</think>To determine if Syracuse
      University is west of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), I need to

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Syracuse University is located in Syracuse, New York

      - MIT is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts (near Boston)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic relationship between these locations.

      - New York state is generally west of Massachusetts

      - Syracuse is in central New York state

      - Cambridge/Boston is in eastern Massachusetts


      Step 3: Visualize their positions on a map of the northeastern United States.

      - Syracuse is significantly further west than Cambridge

      - Syracuse is approximately 250-300 miles west of Cambridge


      Based on this geographic analysis, Syracuse University is indeed located west
      of MIT.

      1. University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
      (PA).

      2. Northeastern University is located in Boston, Massachusetts (MA).

      3. To determine which is more west, I need to compare the geographic locations
      of Philadelphia and Boston.

      4. Philadelphia is located in the eastern part of Pennsylvania.

      5. Boston is located in the eastern part of Massachusetts.

      6. Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts in the United States.

      7. Therefore, Philadelphia (where UPenn is) is west of Boston (where Northeastern
      is).


      So the question is asking if UPenn in Philadelphia, PA is west of Northeastern
      University in Boston, MA. Based on my geographical knowledge, Philadelphia is
      indeed west of Boston, which means UPenn is west of Northeastern University.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

      - Northeastern University is located in Boston, Massachusetts.


      Step 2: Determine the east-west relationship between these cities.

      - Philadelphia is in eastern Pennsylvania.

      - Boston is in eastern Massachusetts.

      - On a map of the United States, Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts.

      - Specifically, Philadelphia is west of Boston.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Since Philadelphia is west of Boston, University of Pennsylvania is west of
      Northeastern University.


      YES'

      to determine the geographical locations of:

      1. University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) in PA (Pennsylvania)

      2. Northeastern University in MA (Massachusetts)


      Then I need to compare their east-west positions to determine which is further
      west.


      The University of Pennsylvania is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which
      is in the eastern part of Pennsylvania.


      Northeastern University is located in Boston, Massachusetts, which is in the
      eastern part of Massachusetts.


      Now I need to determine which is further west. The east coast of the United
      States generally runs from northeast to southwest, with Maine being the northeasternmost
      state and Florida being in the southeast.


      Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts. Philadelphia (where UPenn is) is west
      of Boston (where Northeastern is).


      So comparing their locations:

      - University of Pennsylvania: Philadelphia, PA

      - Northeastern University: Boston, MA


      Philadelphia is west of Boston, which means UPenn is west of Northeastern.</think>I

      - Philadelphia, PA is located in the eastern part of Pennsylvania

      - Boston, MA is located in the eastern part of Massachusetts


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positioning of these two cities.

      - Massachusetts is east of Pennsylvania on the US map

      - Boston is east of Philadelphia


      Step 4: Make the final determination about the universities.

      - Since University of Pennsylvania is in Philadelphia (PA) and Northeastern
      is in Boston (MA), and Philadelphia is west of Boston, UPenn is west of Northeastern
      University.


      YES, University of Pennsylvania, PA is located west of Northeastern University,
