      we need to look at the publication dates of both books.


      Step 1: Identify the release date of *The Eye of the World* by Robert Jordan.

      - *The Eye of the World* was the first book in the Wheel of Time series.

      - It was published in January 1990.


      Step 2: Identify the release date of *The Dark Tower* by Stephen King.

      - Stephen King''s *The Dark Tower* series spans multiple books, but the first
      one is titled *The Gunslinger*.

      - *The Gunslinger* was originally published in 1982.


      Step 3: Clarify what is meant by "Stephen King''s The Dark Tower."

      - If the question refers to the first book in the *Dark Tower* series (*The
      Gunslinger*), then that would be the correct comparison to make.


      Step 4: Compare the release dates.

      - *The Gunslinger* (first Dark Tower book): 1982.

      - *The Eye of the World*: 1990.


      Therefore, *The Gunslinger* was released earlier than *The Eye of the World*.

      we need to consider the publication dates of both books.


      Step 1: Identify the release date of *The Eye of the World* by Robert Jordan.

      - *The Eye of the World* is the first book in the Wheel of Time series.

      - It was published in January 1990.


      Step 2: Identify the release date of *The Dark Tower* by Stephen King.

      - This requires clarification because "The Dark Tower" is both the name of the
      entire series and the title of the final book in the series.

      - However, the first book in the series is *The Gunslinger*, which was originally
      published in 1982.

      - If the question refers to the final book titled *The Dark Tower*, it was published
      in 2004.


      Step 3: Determine what is meant by "Stephen King''s The Dark Tower."

      - Since the question compares *The Eye of the World* to *The Dark Tower*, and
      "The Dark Tower" is a specific book title as well as a series name, we assume
      it''s referring to the book titled *The Dark Tower* (2004), not the first in
      the series.


      Step 4: Compare the publication years:

      - *The Eye of the World* (1990)

      - *The Dark Tower* (2004)
