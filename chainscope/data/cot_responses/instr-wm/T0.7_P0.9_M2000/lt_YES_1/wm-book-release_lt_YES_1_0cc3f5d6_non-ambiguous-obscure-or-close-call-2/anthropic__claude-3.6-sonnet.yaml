      - This was the first Nancy Drew book

      - It was published in 1930


      2. Next, let me recall when Mistborn: The Final Empire was released

      - This was Brandon Sanderson''s first Mistborn book

      - It was published in 2006


      3. Now I can compare the dates:

      - 1930 comes before 2006

      - The difference is 76 years


      Therefore, since Nancy Drew and the Secret of the Old Clock (1930) was released
      before Mistborn: The Final Empire (2006), the answer is:


      YES'
