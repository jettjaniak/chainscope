      "The Magic School Bus at the Waterworks" was released earlier than Neil deGrasse
      Tyson''s "Astrophysics for People in a Hurry," let''s consider the publication
      dates of both books.


      1. **The Magic School Bus at the Waterworks** by Joanna Cole and Bruce Degen
      was published in 1986. This book is part of a popular series known for its educational
      content, focusing on science and learning through the adventures of Ms. Frizzle
      and her class.


      2. **Astrophysics for People in a Hurry** by Neil deGrasse Tyson was published
      in 2017. This book aims to explain astrophysics in an accessible way for a broad
      audience, reflecting Tyson''s commitment to making science more understandable
      and engaging for everyone.


      Given these publication dates, it''s clear that "The Magic School Bus at the
      Waterworks" (1986) was published significantly earlier than "Astrophysics for
      People in a Hurry" (2017).
