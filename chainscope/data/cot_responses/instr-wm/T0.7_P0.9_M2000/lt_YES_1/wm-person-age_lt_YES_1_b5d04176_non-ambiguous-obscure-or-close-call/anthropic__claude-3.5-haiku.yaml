      - Muhammad was born around 570 CE

      - He died in 632 CE

      - So he lived approximately 62 years


      2. Miguel de Cervantes'' lifespan:

      - Cervantes was born in 1547 CE

      - He died in 1616 CE

      - So he lived approximately 69 years


      3. Comparing their ages at death:

      - Muhammad died at about 62 years old

      - Cervantes died at about 69 years old


      4. Answering the specific question: "Did Muhammad die younger than Miguel de
      Cervantes?"

      - Since Muhammad was 62 and Cervantes was 69, Muhammad did indeed die at a younger
      age


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

    fde6abcc-a2f8-4ecf-8589-fa3da5b5fea7: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Alexander Hamilton:

      - Born: January 11, 1755

      - Died: July 12, 1804 (after being shot in a duel with Aaron Burr)

      - Age at death: 49 years old


      2. Lee Harvey Oswald:

      - Born: October 18, 1939

      - Died: November 24, 1963 (shot by Jack Ruby)

      - Age at death: 24 years old


      3. Comparing their ages at death:

      - Hamilton died at 49

      - Oswald died at 24

      - 24 is less than 49


      4. Therefore, Oswald did die younger than Hamilton.

      1. Alighiero di Bellincione:

      - He was an Italian from the medieval period (around the 14th century)

      - Life expectancy in medieval times was much shorter than in modern times

      - Typical lifespans were often around 40-50 years

      - Medieval people typically died much younger than modern people

      - Born: 1451

      - Died: 1506

      - Lived to be approximately 54-55 years old


      2. Emily Dickinson''s lifespan:

      - Born: 1830

      - Died: 1886

      - Lived to be approximately 55-56 years old


      3. Comparing their ages at death:

      - Columbus died at around 54-55 years old

      - Dickinson died at around 55-56 years old


      4. Determining who died younger:

      - Their ages at death are very close

      - Dickinson actually lived slightly longer than Columbus


      Therefore, the answer is:


      NO (Christopher Columbus did NOT die younger than Emily Dickinson)'
