    24b61f60-3912-4250-adfc-c34ad16f091d: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s locate the Statue of Liberty:

      - The Statue of Liberty is actually located on Liberty Island in New York Harbor

      - While technically part of Manhattan''s jurisdiction, it''s geographically
      south of Manhattan


      2. Next, let''s locate Father Duffy Square:

      - Father Duffy Square is located in Manhattan''s Times Square area

      - It is in Midtown Manhattan, which is in the central part of the island


      3. Comparing their locations:

      - The Statue of Liberty is south of Manhattan''s central area

      - Father Duffy Square is in central Manhattan

      - Therefore, the Statue of Liberty is indeed south of Father Duffy Square


      4. Checking the specific requirement of the question:

      - The question asks if the Statue of Liberty is south of Father Duffy Square

      - Based on our reasoning, this is true


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      - But the Statue of Liberty is not physically located on Manhattan island

      - So this specific location does not exist


      4. Given the precise wording of the question, this means we cannot definitively
      say whether the non-existent location is north or south of Father Duffy Square


      Since the premise involves a non-existent location, I cannot confidently answer
      YES or NO.


      However, if I must choose, I would say NO, because the Statue of Liberty is
      not located on Manhattan island.'

      - The Bronx Zoo is located in the Bronx

      - The Bronx Zoo''s Admin South is also located in the Bronx


      3. So the question becomes: Is Ellis Island south of the Bronx Zoo?

      - Yes, Ellis Island is geographically south of the Bronx Zoo


      4. However, the question specifically asks about "ELLIS ISLAND NATIONAL MONUMENT,
      Manhattan", which is technically incorrect because Ellis Island is not in Manhattan.


      Despite the geographical truth that Ellis Island is south of the Bronx Zoo,
      the specific location description in the question is incorrect.


      Therefore, the answer is: NO'

      \ specifically in Lower Manhattan\n\n2. To determine if JFK is south of NYU,\
      \ we need to compare their geographical positions:\n   - Manhattan is a northern\
      \ borough of NYC\n   - Queens is southeast of Manhattan\n   - JFK Airport is\
      \ located in the southern part of Queens, which is even further south\n\n3.\
      \ So if we draw a line from NYU to JFK Airport, the line would go south and\

      1. First, locate Nathan''s Famous Restaurant:

      - Nathan''s Famous is located in Coney Island, Brooklyn

      - Coney Island is in the southern part of Brooklyn


      2. Locate Central Park Lake 59th St Area:

      - This is in the middle of Manhattan
