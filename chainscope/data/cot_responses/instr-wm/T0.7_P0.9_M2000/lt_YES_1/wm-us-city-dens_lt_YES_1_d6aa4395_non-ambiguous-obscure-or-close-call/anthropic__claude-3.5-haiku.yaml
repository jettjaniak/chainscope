      1. First, let''s consider population density, which is people per square mile.


      2. Manhattan (New York City):

      - Manhattan is extremely dense

      - It''s about 23 square miles in area

      - Population is around 1.6 million people

      3. Miami Beach:

      1. First, I''ll find the population density of Compton, CA:

      - Compton''s area is about 10.1 square miles

      - Its population is around 96,000

      - Population density = 96,000 / 10.1 = approximately 9,505 people per square
