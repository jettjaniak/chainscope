    cfd7d8bc-7bf3-4362-8455-38bec5ffba15: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s find the population of Goa, India:

      - Goa is a small state in western India

      - According to the 2011 census, Goa''s population was about 1.4 million people


      2. Next, let''s find the population of Clark County, Nevada:

      - Clark County includes Las Vegas and is located in Nevada, USA

      - As of 2021 estimates, Clark County has approximately 2.3 million people


      3. Comparing the populations:

      - Goa: 1.4 million

      - Clark County: 2.3 million

      - 2.3 million is greater than 1.4 million


      4. The question asks: Is Goa less populous than Clark County, Nevada?

      - Since Clark County has more people than Goa, the answer is YES.

      1. First, let''s consider the population of Mumbai City district:

      - Mumbai City district is a dense urban area in India

      - It has a population of approximately 3.1 million people (as of recent census
      data)


      2. Now, let''s look at the Upper West Side in New York City:

      - The Upper West Side is a neighborhood in Manhattan

      - It typically has a population of around 200,000 to 250,000 people


      3. Comparing the two populations:

      - Mumbai City district: ~3.1 million

      - Upper West Side: ~200,000-250,000


      4. Conclusion:

      - Mumbai City district has significantly more people than the Upper West Side

      - Therefore, the Upper West Side is LESS populous than Mumbai City district


      The answer is: NO (Upper West Side is NOT less populous than Mumbai City district
      - in fact, Mumbai City district has many more people)'

    38f4c6d6-ff72-443b-a941-5f4ae45892a1: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll look up the population of the City of Sydney:

      - The City of Sydney itself (local government area) has around 200,000 people

      - The Greater Sydney metropolitan area has about 5.3 million people


      2. Next, I''ll check the population of Stockholm urban area:

      - The Stockholm urban area has around 1.6 million people


      3. Comparing the populations:

      - City of Sydney (local government area): ~200,000

      - Stockholm urban area: ~1.6 million

      - Greater Sydney metropolitan area: ~5.3 million


      4. Reasoning:

      - Even the City of Sydney''s local government area (200,000) is smaller than
      Stockholm''s urban area (1.6 million)

      - The metropolitan area is much larger, but the question specifies "City of
      Sydney"


      5. Conclusion:

      Since the City of Sydney has fewer people than the Stockholm urban area, the
      answer is:


      YES'
