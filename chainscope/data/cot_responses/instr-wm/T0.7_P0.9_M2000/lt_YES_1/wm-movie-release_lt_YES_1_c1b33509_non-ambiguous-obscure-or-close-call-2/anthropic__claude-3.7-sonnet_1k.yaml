      Since 2000 comes before 2019, "Meet the Parents" was released earlier than "Chhichhore."</think>To

      First, "Meet the Parents" directed by Jay Roach:

      Chhichhore is a Hindi-language comedy-drama film directed by Nitesh Tiwari.
      It was released in 2019. (I believe this is correct, as it''s a more recent
      Bollywood film starring Sushant Singh Rajput.)


      Now to compare:

      - Meet the Parents: released in 2000

      - Chhichhore: released in 2019


      Since 2000 comes before 2019, Meet the Parents was released earlier than Chhichhore.</think>To

      I need to determine when each was released to answer whether Aashiqui came out
      earlier than the Krrish series.


      Aashiqui was a Bollywood romantic drama film directed by Mahesh Bhatt. It was
      released in 1990. It became quite popular for its music.


      The Krrish series by Rakesh Roshan began with:

      - "Koi... Mil Gaya" (2003) - This was technically the first film in the franchise

      - "Krrish" (2006) - The first film actually titled "Krrish"

      - "Krrish 3" (2013) - The sequel

      The Krrish franchise started with "Koi... Mil Gaya" in 2003, followed by the
      first film actually titled "Krrish" in 2006, and then "Krrish 3" in 2013.

      1990 (Aashiqui) comes before 2003/2006 (beginning of Krrish series).

      So, Aashiqui (1990) was released earlier than the first movie in the Krrish

      - There were sequels: Krrish 3 was released in 2013 (Note: There was no "Krrish
      2" - they went straight to Krrish 3)


      So comparing the release dates:

      - Aashiqui: 1990

      - First film in Krrish series (Koi Mil Gaya): 2003

      - First film titled Krrish: 2006


      Since 1990 is earlier than both 2003 and 2006, Aashiqui was released earlier
      than the Krrish series.</think>I''ll solve this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify when Mahesh Bhatt''s "Aashiqui" was released.

      "Aashiqui" was released in 1990 and was a major musical hit starring Rahul Roy
      and Anu Aggarwal.


      Step 2: Identify when the Krrish series began.

      The Krrish series, directed by Rakesh Roshan, began with "Koi... Mil Gaya" in
      2003, followed by "Krrish" in 2006, and "Krrish 3" in 2013.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      "Aashiqui" (1990) was released before the first film in the Krrish series (2003).


      YES, Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui was released earlier than Rakesh Roshan''s Krrish
      series.'

      to determine the release years of Mahesh Bhatt''s "Aashiqui" and Rakesh Roshan''s
      "Krrish" series, and then compare them.


      First, let me recall when "Aashiqui" was released:

      Mahesh Bhatt directed "Aashiqui" which was released in 1990. It was a romantic
      musical film featuring Rahul Roy and Anu Aggarwal.


      Now for the "Krrish" series:

      The "Krrish" series began with "Koi... Mil Gaya" (2003), which was followed
      by:

      - "Krrish" (2006)

      - "Krrish 3" (2013)


      So comparing:

      "Aashiqui" - 1990

      "Krrish" series - started in 2003/2006


      Since 1990 comes before 2003/2006, "Aashiqui" was released earlier than the
      "Krrish" series.</think>To answer this question, I need to determine when each
      film/series was released and compare their timelines.


      Step 1: Identify when Mahesh Bhatt''s "Aashiqui" was released.

      "Aashiqui" was released in 1990 as a romantic musical film directed by Mahesh
      Bhatt.


      Step 2: Identify when Rakesh Roshan''s "Krrish" series began.

      The "Krrish" series technically began with "Koi... Mil Gaya" in 2003, followed
      by:

      - "Krrish" in 2006

      - "Krrish 3" in 2013


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      "Aashiqui" (1990) was released about 13 years before the first film in the Krrish
      universe (2003).

      need to determine the release years of both films.

      "The Waterboy" directed by Frank Coraci and starring Adam Sandler was released
      in 1998.


      Step 2: Identify when "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" was released.

      "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" directed by David Yates was released
      in two parts:

      - Part 1 was released in 2010

      - Part 2 was released in 2011


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      1998 (The Waterboy) comes before both 2010 and 2011 (Harry Potter and the Deathly
      Hallows).
