    d0e7a2b8-ce70-4f6e-91e3-a4ffc19fe7b5: 'To answer this question,
      we need to determine the release year of Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui and the release
      year of Rakesh Roshan''s Krrish series.


      1. Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui was released in 1990.

      2. Rakesh Roshan''s Krrish series started with the release of Koi... Mil Gaya
      in 2003, which is often considered the first part of the series, and then Krrish
      was released in 2006.


      Since 1990 (Aashiqui) is earlier than 2003 (Koi... Mil Gaya) and 2006 (Krrish),
      we can conclude that Aashiqui was released before the Krrish series.


      The answer is: YES'
    d7b8edb3-e741-4af9-bcc0-d231abed8a7f: 'To answer this question,
      let''s consider the release years of the mentioned movies.


      1. **Release Year of Aashiqui**: Mahesh Bhatt''s film "Aashiqui" was released
      in 1990. It was a romantic musical drama that became quite popular for its soundtrack.


      2. **Release Year of Krrish Series**: The Krrish series by Rakesh Roshan starts
      with "Koi... Mil Gaya" in 2003, which is often considered the first part of
      the series due to its storyline connection with the subsequent films. The first
      film directly titled "Krrish" was released in 2006, followed by "Krrish 3" in
      2013.


      Given these release years:

      - Aashiqui was released in 1990.

      - The first related film to the Krrish series, "Koi... Mil Gaya", was released
      in 2003, and the first titled "Krrish" in 2006.


      Since 1990 is earlier than both 2003 and 2006, we can conclude that Mahesh Bhatt''s
      Aashiqui was indeed released earlier than Rakesh Roshan''s Krrish series.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      we need to compare the release years of Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui and Rakesh

      1. **Identify the release year of Aashiqui**: Aashiqui, directed by Mahesh Bhatt,
      was released in 1990.


      2. **Identify the release year of the first film in the Krrish series**: The
      first film in the Krrish series, Koi... Mil Gaya, was released in 2003. It was
      directed by Rakesh Roshan and is considered the first part of the series, although
      it wasn''t titled "Krrish" directly. The film Krrish, which is the sequel to
      Koi... Mil Gaya, was released in 2006.


      3. **Compare the release years**: Since Aashiqui was released in 1990 and the
      first film related to the Krrish series (Koi... Mil Gaya) was released in 2003,
      Aashiqui was indeed released earlier than any film in the Krrish series.

      1. **Andaz Apna Apna** - This film was directed by Rajkumar Santoshi and released
      in 1994.

      2. **Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro** - This film was directed by Kundan Shah and released
      in 1983.


      Next, we compare the release years to determine which movie was released earlier:


      - **Andaz Apna Apna (1994)** vs. **Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro (1983)**


      Since 1983 is earlier than 1994, **Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro** was released earlier
      than **Andaz Apna Apna**.


      Given the question asks if **Andaz Apna Apna** was released earlier than **Jaane

      NO'

      directed by Rajkumar Santoshi, was released in 1994.


      2. Next, we need to find the release year of Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro. Jaane Bhi Do
      Yaaro, directed by Kundan Shah, was released in 1983.


      3. Now, we compare the release years. Since 1983 is earlier than 1994, Jaane
