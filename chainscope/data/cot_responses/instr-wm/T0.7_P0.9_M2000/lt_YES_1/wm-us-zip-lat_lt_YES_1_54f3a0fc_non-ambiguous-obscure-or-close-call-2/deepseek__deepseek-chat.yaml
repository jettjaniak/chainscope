      \ file for the backend:\n\n```bash\ntouch server.js\n```\n\nThen, add the following\

      \  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n\
      \n### 4. Run the Server\nMake sure you have `express` installed:\n\n```bash\n\
      npm install express\n```\n\nThen, run the server:\n\n```bash\nnode server.js\n\
      ```\n\n### 5. Add Frontend to Backend\nUpdate `server.js` to serve the `index.html`\
      \ file:\n\n```js\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\
      const port = 8000;\napp.use(express.json());\napp.use(express.urled( { extended:\
      \ true } ));\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n    res.sendFile( 'index.html',\

      \ () => {\n    console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:${port');\n\
      });\n```\n\n### 6. Update `index.html`\nUpdate `index.html` to send a POST request\
      \ to the backend:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Note App</>\n\
