      33139 in Florida (FL) and 11954 in New York (NY), and then compare their positions
      in terms of latitude to determine which one is south of the other.


      1. **Identify the States**: The zip code 33139 is located in the state of Florida
      (FL), and the zip code 11954 is located in the state of New York (NY).


      2. **General Geographic Location of States**: Florida is generally located in
      the southeastern part of the United States, known for being one of the southernmost
      states. New York, on the other hand, is located in the northeastern part of
      the United States, significantly farther north than Florida.


      3. **Latitude Comparison**: Without needing the exact latitudes, it''s known
      that Florida is south of New York. The general rule in the Northern Hemisphere
      is that as you move south, the latitude decreases. Thus, any location in Florida
      will have a lower latitude than any location in New York.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Florida is south of New York, any zip code in
      Florida, including 33139, will be south of any zip code in New York, including
      11954.

      we need to determine the geographical locations associated with the zip codes
      94027 and 11976.


      1. **Identify the states**: The first step is to recognize the states associated
      with these zip codes. The zip code 94027 is located in California (CA), and
      the zip code 11976 is located in New York (NY).


      2. **General geographical knowledge of the US**: California is on the West Coast
      of the United States, while New York is on the East Coast. Generally, California
      is south of New York in terms of latitude, as New York is located in the northeastern
      part of the country.


      3. **Latitude comparison**: Without needing the exact latitudes, we can infer
      from general geographical knowledge that California, being on the West Coast
      and generally at a lower latitude than New York, is south of New York.


      4. **Conclusion based on geographical location**: Given that California is south
      of New York, any location within California, including the area covered by the
      zip code 94027, would be south of any location in New York, including the area
      covered by the zip code 11976.
