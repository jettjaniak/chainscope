      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 33139 is in Miami Beach, Florida (FL)

      - 11954 is in Montauk, New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider their geographic positions.

      - Florida is located in the southeastern United States

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      - Florida extends much further south than New York

      - Miami Beach (33139) is near the southern tip of Florida

      - Montauk (11954) is on the eastern end of Long Island in New York
