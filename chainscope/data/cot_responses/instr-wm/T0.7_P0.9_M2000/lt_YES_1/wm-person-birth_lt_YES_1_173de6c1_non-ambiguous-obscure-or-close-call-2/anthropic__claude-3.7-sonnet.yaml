      Friedrich Nietzsche was born on October 15, 1844.

      Joseph Stalin was born on December 18, 1878 (though in the old Russian calendar
      it was December 6).

      not "Friedrich Nietzsche." If we''re referring to Friedrich Nietzsche, then
      YES, he was born earlier than Stalin. If "Friedrich Nitzsch" is a different
      historical figure I''m not familiar with, I would need more information.

      Isaac Newton was born on December 25, 1642 (or January 4, 1643, depending on
      calendar used) and died in 1727. He was a 17th-18th century physicist, mathematician,
      and scientist.


      Step 2: Determine when Andy Warhol lived.

      Andy Warhol was born on August 6, 1928, and died on February 22, 1987. He was
      a 20th century artist and leading figure in the pop art movement.


      Step 3: Compare their birth dates.

      Isaac Newton was born in 1642/1643, while Andy Warhol was born in 1928.

      1642 comes before 1928 chronologically.

      Genghis Khan was born around 1162 CE in Mongolia. (Some sources place his birth
      between 1155-1167, but 1162 is commonly accepted).

      1162 CE is approximately 773 years earlier than 1935 CE.
