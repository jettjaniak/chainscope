      2. Manfred von Richthofen, also known as the "Red Baron", was a famous German
      fighter pilot during World War I.


      3. Manfred von Richthofen lived from 1892 to 1918, which is much later in history.


      4. Since Columbus was born in 1451, and Richthofen was born in 1892, Columbus
      was indeed born earlier.


      5. Therefore, the answer is: YES, Christopher Columbus was born earlier than
      Manfred von Richthofen.
