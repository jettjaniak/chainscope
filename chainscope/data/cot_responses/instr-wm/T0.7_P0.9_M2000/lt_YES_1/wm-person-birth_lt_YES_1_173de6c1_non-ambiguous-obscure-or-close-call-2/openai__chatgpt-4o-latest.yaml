      individuals.


      1. Friedrich Nietzsche was born in the 19th century. Specifically, he was born
      in 1844.

      2. Joseph Stalin was also born in the 19th century, but later than Nietzsche.
      Stalin was born in 1878.


      Now, we compare the two years:

      - Nietzsche: 1844

      - Stalin: 1878


      Since 1844 is earlier than 1878, it follows that Friedrich Nietzsche was born
      earlier than Joseph Stalin.

      1. Peter I of Russia (Piotr I):

      - Born: June 9, 1672.


      2. William Wallace:

      - William Wallace was born around 1270.

      - Peter I was born in 1672.


      This means William Wallace was born approximately 400 years before Peter I.
