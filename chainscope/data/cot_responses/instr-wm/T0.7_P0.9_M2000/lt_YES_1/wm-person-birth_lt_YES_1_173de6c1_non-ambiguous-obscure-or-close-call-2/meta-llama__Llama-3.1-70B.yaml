      1. **Identify the birth date of Saint Patrick**: Saint Patrick is believed to
      have been born in the late 4th century, around 385 AD.


      2. **Identify the birth date of Pierre Trudeau**: Pierre Trudeau, a former Prime
      Minister of Canada, was born on October 18, 1919.


      3. **Compare the birth dates**: Since the birth date of Saint Patrick is around
      385 AD, which is significantly earlier than Pierre Trudeau''s birth date of
      1919, we can conclude that Saint Patrick was indeed born earlier than Pierre
      Trudeau.

      we need to compare the birth dates of Alexander the Great and Richard Nixon.


      1. First, identify the birth date of Alexander the Great. Alexander the Great
      was born in 356 BC.


      2. Next, identify the birth date of Richard Nixon. Richard Nixon was born on
      January 9, 1913.


      3. Compare the two birth dates. Since 356 BC is earlier than 1913 AD, we can
      conclude that Alexander the Great was indeed born before Richard Nixon.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: **YES**'
