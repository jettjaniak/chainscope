      around the late 15th and early 16th centuries. His birth year is estimated to
      be around 1460-1469.

      wife of King Henry VIII of England.  Her birth year is debated, but it is generally
      placed between 1501 and 1507.

      for da Gama''s birth (1469) and the earliest for Boleyn (1501), da Gama was
      born earlier.
