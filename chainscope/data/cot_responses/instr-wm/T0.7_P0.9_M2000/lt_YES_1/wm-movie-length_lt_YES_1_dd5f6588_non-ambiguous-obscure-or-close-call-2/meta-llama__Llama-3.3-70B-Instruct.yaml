      \ we need to compare the lengths of two movies: David Yates's \"Harry Potter\
      \ and the Deathly Hallows\" and Peter Jackson's \"The Hobbit\".\n\nFirst, let's\
      \ consider \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\". This movie was released\
      \ in two parts: \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1\" and \"\
      Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2\". However, for the sake\
      \ of comparison, we'll consider the combined version or the overall story as\
      \ one entity since \"The Hobbit\" is also a single story, albeit divided into\
      \ three parts for its film adaptation. The combined runtime of \"Harry Potter\
      \ and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1\" and \"Harry Potter and the Deathly\
      \ Hallows \u2013 Part 2\" is approximately 261 minutes (Part 1: 146 minutes,\
      \ Part 2: 115 minutes, but the extended versions can vary).\n\nNext, let's consider\
      \ Peter Jackson's \"The Hobbit\". This movie was also divided into three parts:\
      \ \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\", \"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug\"\
      , and \"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\". The runtime for these movies\
      \ is approximately 182 minutes for the first part, 161 minutes for the second,\
      \ and 144 minutes for the third, totaling about 487 minutes for the trilogy.\n\
      \nGiven these lengths, we can see that the total runtime of \"The Hobbit\" trilogy\
      \ far exceeds the combined runtime of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\"\
      \ parts 1 and 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether David Yates's \"Harry Potter\
      \ and the Deathly Hallows\" is shorter than Peter Jackson's \"The Hobbit\" is:\
      \ YES."

      \   - If we compare the runtime of the single film \"Don\" (1978) with each\

      \ (which would be 315 minutes or 5 hours 15 minutes), \"Don\" (1978) is significantly\
      \ shorter.\n\nGiven the question asks if \"Don\" is shorter than \"Gangs of\
      \ Wasseypur\" without specifying whether it's comparing to one part or the whole\
      \ series, the most logical interpretation is comparing the single film \"Don\"\

      \ we need to compare the runtime of the two movies: Chandra Barot's Don (1978)\

      2. Next, let's find the runtime of Anurag Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur. The\
      \ movie was released in two parts: Gangs of Wasseypur \u2013 Part 1 and Gangs\
      \ of Wasseypur \u2013 Part 2. The runtime of Part 1 is approximately 160 minutes\

      we''ll need to compare the runtime of two movies: Chandra Barot''s "Don" (1978)
      and Anurag Kashyap''s "Gangs of Wasseypur" (2012).


      1. **Identify the runtime of "Don" (1978):** The original film "Don" starring
      Amitabh Bachchan, directed by Chandra Barot, has a runtime. According to various
      sources, the runtime of "Don" (1978) is approximately 175 minutes (or 2 hours
      and 55 minutes).


      2. **Identify the runtime of "Gangs of Wasseypur":** Anurag Kashyap''s "Gangs
      of Wasseypur" is a two-part crime film. However, when considering its total
      runtime, both parts combined are usually what''s referred to. Part 1 runs approximately
      160 minutes (2 hours and 40 minutes), and Part 2 runs approximately 155 minutes
      (2 hours and 35 minutes). The combined runtime for both parts is about 315 minutes
      (or 5 hours and 15 minutes).


      3. **Compare the runtimes:** Comparing the total runtime of "Gangs of Wasseypur"
      (about 315 minutes for both parts) to the runtime of "Don" (about 175 minutes),
      it''s clear that "Don" is significantly shorter than the combined runtime of
      "Gangs of Wasseypur".


      Given these steps and comparisons, the answer to whether Chandra Barot''s "Don"
      is shorter than Anurag Kashyap''s "Gangs of Wasseypur" is: **YES**.'

      Step 1: Identify the runtime of "Don" (1978). The original runtime of "Don"
      starring Amitabh Bachchan is approximately 175 minutes (2 hours 55 minutes).

      runs for about 160 minutes (2 hours 40 minutes), and Part 2 runs for about 159
      minutes (2 hours 39 minutes).


      Step 3: Compare the runtime of "Don" (1978) with "Gangs of Wasseypur". Since
      "Gangs of Wasseypur" is often considered as a whole for its narrative, comparing
      the total runtime is more accurate for this context. However, if we consider

      we need to compare the running times of the two movies: Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui
      and Takashi Shimizu''s The Grudge.


      1. **Identify the Running Time of Aashiqui**: The 1990 Indian film Aashiqui,
      directed by Mahesh Bhatt, has a running time. According to various sources,
      Aashiqui''s running time is approximately 152 minutes (or 2 hours and 32 minutes).


      2. **Identify the Running Time of The Grudge**: The 2004 American supernatural
      horror film The Grudge, directed by Takashi Shimizu, is a remake of his own
      2002 Japanese horror film Ju-On: The Grudge. The running time of the 2004 version
      of The Grudge is approximately 91 minutes (or 1 hour and 31 minutes).


      3. **Compare the Running Times**: Comparing the two, Aashiqui has a running
      time of about 152 minutes, while The Grudge has a running time of about 91 minutes.


      Given these steps, we can conclude that Aashiqui is longer than The Grudge.
      Therefore, the answer to whether Aashiqui is shorter than The Grudge is:


      NO'

      let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Identify the movies**: We have two movies in question - "Aashiqui" directed
      by Mahesh Bhatt and "The Grudge" directed by Takashi Shimizu.


      2. **Aashiqui details**: "Aashiqui" is a 1990 Indian musical romance film. The
      runtime of "Aashiqui" is approximately 143 minutes (2 hours and 23 minutes).


      3. **The Grudge details**: "The Grudge" (also known as "Ju-On: The Grudge")
      is a 2004 supernatural horror film. The runtime of "The Grudge" is approximately
      91 minutes (1 hour and 31 minutes) for the American version. However, the original
      Japanese version "Ju-On" (2002), which "The Grudge" is based on, has a runtime
      of about 92 minutes. Since "The Grudge" is specified, we''ll consider the American
      version''s runtime for comparison.


      4. **Comparison**: Now, comparing the runtime of "Aashiqui" (143 minutes) with
      "The Grudge" (91 minutes), it''s clear that "Aashiqui" is longer than "The Grudge".


      Based on the above reasoning, the answer to whether "Aashiqui" is shorter than
      "The Grudge" is: **NO**.'
    ff31d94f-90bc-4fcd-88a9-02d36d3eabe1: 'To determine if Mahesh Bhatt''s
      Aashiqui is shorter than Takashi Shimizu''s The Grudge, let''s break down the
      steps:


      1. **Find the runtime of Aashiqui (1990)**: Aashiqui, directed by Mahesh Bhatt,
      has a runtime. According to various sources, including IMDb, Aashiqui (1990)
      has a runtime of approximately 152 minutes.


      2. **Find the runtime of The Grudge (2004)**: The Grudge, directed by Takashi
      Shimizu, also has a specified runtime. According to sources like IMDb, The Grudge
      (2004) has a runtime of approximately 91 minutes.


      3. **Compare the runtimes**: Now, we compare the runtime of Aashiqui (152 minutes)
      with that of The Grudge (91 minutes) to determine which film is shorter.


      Based on the comparison, since 91 minutes is less than 152 minutes, The Grudge
      is shorter than Aashiqui.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui is shorter than Takashi
      Shimizu''s The Grudge is: **NO**.'
