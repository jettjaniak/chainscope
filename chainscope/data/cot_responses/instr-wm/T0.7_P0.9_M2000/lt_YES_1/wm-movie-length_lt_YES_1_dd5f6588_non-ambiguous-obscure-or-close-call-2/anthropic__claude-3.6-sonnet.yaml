      3. Since 108 is less than 125, Meet the Parents is indeed shorter than Fifty
      Shades of Grey.


      YES'

    3997926e-a0d0-4afa-b0c9-e42e95cda87f: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. Aradhana (1969) is a Bollywood film directed by Shakti Samanta

      - Its runtime is approximately 169 minutes (2 hours and 49 minutes)


      2. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) directed
      by Andrew Adamson

      - Its runtime is 143 minutes (2 hours and 23 minutes)


      3. Comparing the runtimes:

      - Aradhana: 169 minutes

      - Chronicles of Narnia: 143 minutes

      - 169 > 143


      4. Since Aradhana is longer than The Chronicles of Narnia...


      NO'

      1. First, let me recall the runtimes of both films:

      - Aradhana (1969) has a runtime of 169 minutes

      - The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) has
      a runtime of 143 minutes


      2. To determine if Aradhana is shorter, I need to compare:

      169 minutes vs 143 minutes


      3. 169 is greater than 143, which means Aradhana is actually longer


      Therefore, since Aradhana is longer, not shorter, than The Chronicles of Narnia:


      NO'
