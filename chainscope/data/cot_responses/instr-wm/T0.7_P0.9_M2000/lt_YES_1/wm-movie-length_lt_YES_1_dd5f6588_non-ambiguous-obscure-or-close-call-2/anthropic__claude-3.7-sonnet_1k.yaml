    01ab08af-1277-4678-9419-36e3deabe143: '<think>Let me break this down:


      1. David Yates directed "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"

      2. Peter Jackson directed "The Hobbit"

      3. I need to determine which is shorter in terms of runtime


      First, I need to recall the facts about these films:


      Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was split into two parts:

      - Part 1 (2010): approximately 146 minutes (2 hours 26 minutes)

      - Part 2 (2011): approximately 130 minutes (2 hours 10 minutes)

      Total combined runtime: about 276 minutes (4 hours 36 minutes)


      The Hobbit was also split into three parts:

      - An Unexpected Journey (2012): approximately 169 minutes (2 hours 49 minutes)

      - The Desolation of Smaug (2013): approximately 161 minutes (2 hours 41 minutes)

      - The Battle of the Five Armies (2014): approximately 144 minutes (2 hours 24
      minutes)

      Total combined runtime: about 474 minutes (7 hours 54 minutes)


      So comparing the total runtimes:

      - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (both parts): ~276 minutes

      - The Hobbit (all three parts): ~474 minutes</think>To answer this question,
      I need to compare the runtime of both film series.


      First, let''s examine "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" directed by David
      Yates:

      - This was split into two parts

      - Part 1 runs approximately 146 minutes (2 hours 26 minutes)

      - Part 2 runs approximately 130 minutes (2 hours 10 minutes)

      - Combined runtime: about 276 minutes (4 hours 36 minutes)


      Next, let''s look at "The Hobbit" directed by Peter Jackson:

      - This was split into three films

      - "An Unexpected Journey" runs approximately 169 minutes

      - "The Desolation of Smaug" runs approximately 161 minutes

      - "The Battle of the Five Armies" runs approximately 144 minutes

      - Combined runtime: about 474 minutes (7 hours 54 minutes)


      Comparing these totals: 276 minutes vs. 474 minutes.


      YES, David Yates''s "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" is shorter than Peter
      Jackson''s "The Hobbit" film series.'

      First, I need to clarify some details:

      - David Yates directed Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, which was split
      into two parts: Part 1 and Part 2

      - Peter Jackson directed The Hobbit, which was split into three films: An Unexpected
      Journey, The Desolation of Smaug, and The Battle of the Five Armies


      To answer this question fairly, I should compare the total runtime of each series.


      For Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows:

      - Part 1: approximately 146 minutes

      - Part 2: approximately 130 minutes

      - Total: approximately 276 minutes (about 4 hours and 36 minutes)


      For The Hobbit trilogy:

      - An Unexpected Journey: approximately 169 minutes

      - The Desolation of Smaug: approximately 161 minutes

      - The Battle of the Five Armies: approximately 144 minutes

      two parts (Part 1 and Part 2)

      - "The Hobbit" directed by Peter Jackson was split into three films (An Unexpected
      Journey, The Desolation of Smaug, and The Battle of the Five Armies)


      Step 2: Calculate the total runtime for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

      - Part 1: approximately 146 minutes

      - Part 2: approximately 130 minutes

      - Total: approximately 276 minutes (4 hours and 36 minutes)


      Step 3: Calculate the total runtime for The Hobbit trilogy.

      - An Unexpected Journey: approximately 169 minutes

      - The Desolation of Smaug: approximately 161 minutes

      - The Battle of the Five Armies: approximately 144 minutes

      - Total: approximately 474 minutes (7 hours and 54 minutes)


      Step 4: Compare the two totals.

      276 minutes (Deathly Hallows) vs. 474 minutes (The Hobbit)


      YES, David Yates''s Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is shorter than Peter

      First, I need to identify what "David Yates''s Harry Potter and the Deathly

      2010) and Part 2 (released in 2011). So I need to consider the total runtime
      of both parts together.


      Second, I need to identify what "Peter Jackson''s The Hobbit" refers to. Peter
      Jackson directed "The Hobbit" trilogy, which consists of three films: "An Unexpected
      Journey" (2012), "The Desolation of Smaug" (2013), and "The Battle of the Five
      Armies" (2014). So I need to consider the total runtime of all three Hobbit
      films.


      Now, let me consider the approximate runtimes:

      - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1: ~146 minutes

      - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2: ~130 minutes

      - Total for Deathly Hallows: ~276 minutes


      - The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey: ~169 minutes

      - The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug: ~161 minutes

      - The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies: ~144 minutes

      - Total for The Hobbit trilogy: ~474 minutes


      Given these runtimes, The Hobbit trilogy is significantly longer than the two
      Deathly Hallows films combined.</think>To answer this question, I need to compare
      the total running times of both film adaptations.


      Step 1: Identify what "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" directed by David
      Yates refers to.

      - This was split into two parts: Part 1 (2010) and Part 2 (2011)

      - Part 1 runs approximately 146 minutes

      - Part 2 runs approximately 130 minutes

      - Total running time: about 276 minutes (4 hours and 36 minutes)


      Step 2: Identify what "The Hobbit" directed by Peter Jackson refers to.

      - This was a trilogy of films: "An Unexpected Journey" (2012), "The Desolation
      of Smaug" (2013), and "The Battle of the Five Armies" (2014)

      - The three films combined run approximately 474 minutes (nearly 8 hours)


      Step 3: Compare the total running times.

      276 minutes (Deathly Hallows) vs. 474 minutes (The Hobbit)


      YES, David Yates''s Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is shorter than Peter
      Jackson''s The Hobbit.'

      Barot''s "Don" is shorter than Anurag Kashyap''s "Gangs of Wasseypur" in terms
      of runtime.


      Let me recall what I know about these films:


      1. "Don" (1978) directed by Chandra Barot is a classic Bollywood film starring
      Amitabh Bachchan. I believe its runtime is around 2 hours and 45 minutes (approximately
      165 minutes).


      2. "Gangs of Wasseypur" directed by Anurag Kashyap is a two-part epic crime
      film released in 2012. The total runtime of both parts combined is quite substantial.
      Part 1 is approximately 2 hours and 40 minutes (160 minutes), and Part 2 is
      about 2 hours and 30 minutes (150 minutes). Combined, that''s about 5 hours
      and 10 minutes (310 minutes).


      If we''re comparing the original "Don" to the complete "Gangs of Wasseypur"
      (both parts), then "Don" is definitely shorter. However, if we''re comparing
      "Don" to just Part 1 or Part 2 of "Gangs of Wasseypur" individually, it might
      be closer, but I believe "Don" is still shorter than the combined film but longer
      than either individual part.


      To be precise: "Don" (165 min) is shorter than "Gangs of Wasseypur" total (310
      min), but "Don" (165 min) is slightly longer than either "Gangs of Wasseypur
      Part 1" (160 min) or "Part 2" (150 min) individually.


      Since the question doesn''t specify which part of "Gangs of Wasseypur," I will
      assume it refers to the complete film (both parts together).</think>To answer
      this question, I need to compare the runtimes of both films.

      approximately 165 minutes (2 hours and 45 minutes).


      Step 2: Identify Anurag Kashyap''s "Gangs of Wasseypur" (2012)

      This is a two-part epic crime film. The total combined runtime of both parts
      is approximately 320 minutes (5 hours and 20 minutes). Even if considering just
      Part 1 (about 160 minutes) or Part 2 (about 150 minutes) separately, the complete
      work is "Gangs of Wasseypur" in its entirety.


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes

      165 minutes (Don) vs. 320 minutes (complete Gangs of Wasseypur)


      Since 165 minutes is less than 320 minutes, Chandra Barot''s "Don" is indeed
      shorter than Anurag Kashyap''s "Gangs of Wasseypur" when considering the complete
      film.

      times of two Indian films:

      1. "Don" directed by Chandra Barot

      2. "Gangs of Wasseypur" directed by Anurag Kashyap


      Let me recall what I know about these films:


      Chandra Barot''s "Don" is a 1978 Bollywood crime thriller starring Amitabh Bachchan.
      I believe its runtime is approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes (around 165 minutes).


      Anurag Kashyap''s "Gangs of Wasseypur" was released in 2012. An important detail
      is that this film was released in two parts. If we consider both parts together,
      the total runtime is quite long - I believe around 5 hours and 20 minutes (approximately
      320 minutes). Part 1 alone is about 2 hours and 40 minutes, and Part 2 is about
      2 hours and 40 minutes as well.


      If we''re comparing the original "Don" to the complete "Gangs of Wasseypur"
      (both parts), then Don is shorter. If we''re comparing to just Part 1 or Part
      2 of Gangs of Wasseypur, they would be roughly similar in length.


      However, I believe the question is asking about the complete "Gangs of Wasseypur"
      as a single work, which is how it was conceived even though it was released
      in two parts.</think>To answer this question, I need to compare the running
      times of these two Indian films.


      Step 1: Identify the running time of Chandra Barot''s "Don" (1978)

      - "Don" starring Amitabh Bachchan has a running time of approximately 165-170
      minutes (about 2 hours and 45 minutes)


      Step 2: Identify the running time of Anurag Kashyap''s "Gangs of Wasseypur"
      (2012)

      - "Gangs of Wasseypur" was released as a two-part film

      - When considered in its entirety (both parts combined), it runs for approximately
      320 minutes (about 5 hours and 20 minutes)

      - Even if considering just Part 1 (about 160 minutes) or Part 2 (about 160 minutes)
      individually, the complete work is the two parts together


      Step 3: Compare the two running times

      - "Don" runs for approximately 170 minutes

      - "Gangs of Wasseypur" (complete film) runs for approximately 320 minutes

      - 170 minutes is less than 320 minutes


      YES, Chandra Barot''s "Don" is shorter than Anurag Kashyap''s "Gangs of Wasseypur."'

      First, let me identify the films:

      1. "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro" is a 1983 Indian satirical comedy film directed by Kundan
      Shah.

      2. "Fifty Shades" likely refers to "Fifty Shades of Grey" (2015) or one of its
      sequels ("Fifty Shades Darker" or "Fifty Shades Freed"), directed by James Foley.
      (Actually, the first film was directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, and James Foley
      directed the sequels.)


      Now I need to determine their runtimes:

      - "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro" has a runtime of approximately 132 minutes (2 hours and
      12 minutes).

      - "Fifty Shades of Grey" has a runtime of approximately 125 minutes (2 hours
      and 5 minutes).

      - "Fifty Shades Darker" has a runtime of approximately 118 minutes (1 hour and
      58 minutes).

      - "Fifty Shades Freed" has a runtime of approximately 105 minutes (1 hour and
      45 minutes).


      Since James Foley directed the sequels (not the first film), we should compare
      Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro (132 minutes) with either Fifty Shades Darker (118 minutes)
      or Fifty Shades Freed (105 minutes).


      In either case, Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro (132 minutes) is longer than both Fifty Shades

      - "Fifty Shades" refers to James Foley''s films in the Fifty Shades franchise.
      James Foley directed "Fifty Shades Darker" (2017) and "Fifty Shades Freed" (2018).

      - "Fifty Shades Freed" runs for approximately 105 minutes (1 hour and 45 minutes).

      Since both of James Foley''s Fifty Shades films (118 minutes and 105 minutes)

      Shades Darker" (2017) and "Fifty Shades Freed" (2018), which are part of the
      "Fifty Shades" trilogy. The first film, "Fifty Shades of Grey" (2015), was directed

      Now let me recall the runtimes of these films:


      "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro" (1983) is a Hindi comedy film with a runtime of approximately
      132 minutes (2 hours and 12 minutes).


      "Fifty Shades Darker" has a runtime of about 118 minutes (1 hour and 58 minutes).

      as there are multiple films in that series directed by James Foley:

      - "Fifty Shades Darker" (2017)

      - "Fifty Shades Freed" (2018)


      Either way, I''ll need to find the runtime of both films to compare.


      "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro" (1983) is a cult classic Hindi satirical comedy. Its runtime
      is approximately 132 minutes (2 hours and 12 minutes).


      As for James Foley''s "Fifty Shades" films:

      - "Fifty Shades Darker" has a runtime of approximately 118 minutes (1 hour and
      58 minutes)

      - "Fifty Shades Freed" has a runtime of approximately 105 minutes (1 hour and

      - The Chronicles of Narnia: 143 minutes


      169 minutes > 143 minutes, which means Aradhana is longer than The Chronicles
      of Narnia, not shorter.</think>I''ll think through this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the two movies being compared.

      - Shakti Samanta''s "Aradhana" (1969) - a classic Bollywood film

      - Andrew Adamson''s "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"
      (2005)


      Step 2: Determine the runtime of each movie.

      - "Aradhana" has a runtime of approximately 169 minutes (2 hours and 49 minutes)

      - "The Chronicles of Narnia" has a runtime of approximately 143 minutes (2 hours
      and 23 minutes)


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes.

      - Aradhana: 169 minutes

      - The Chronicles of Narnia: 143 minutes

      - 169 minutes is greater than 143 minutes


      Therefore, Aradhana is longer than The Chronicles of Narnia, not shorter.

      1. The question is asking about the lengths (durations) of two movies: "Aradhana"
      directed by Shakti Samanta and "The Chronicles of Narnia" directed by Andrew
      Adamson.


      2. I need to determine which movie is shorter in length.


      For Shakti Samanta''s "Aradhana":

      - This is a 1969 Bollywood film starring Rajesh Khanna and Sharmila Tagore.

      - Indian films from this era often had runtimes of approximately 2.5-3 hours
      (150-180 minutes).

      - Checking my knowledge, "Aradhana" has a runtime of about 169 minutes (2 hours
      and 49 minutes).


      For Andrew Adamson''s "The Chronicles of Narnia":

      - Assuming this refers to "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and
      the Wardrobe" (2005), which was the first Narnia film directed by Adamson.

      - Hollywood fantasy films of this era typically run about 2-2.5 hours.

      - "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" has a runtime
      of approximately 143 minutes (2 hours and 23 minutes).


      Comparing:

      - Aradhana: ~169 minutes

      - The Chronicles of Narnia: ~143 minutes


      143 minutes is less than 169 minutes, which means "The Chronicles of Narnia"
      is shorter than "Aradhana."</think>To answer this question, I need to compare
      the running times of both movies.


      Step 1: Identify the films in question.

      - "Aradhana" is a 1969 Bollywood film directed by Shakti Samanta, starring Rajesh
      Khanna and Sharmila Tagore.

      - "The Chronicles of Narnia" (specifically "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe")
      is a 2005 fantasy film directed by Andrew Adamson.


      Step 2: Determine their respective running times.

      - "Aradhana" has a runtime of approximately 169 minutes (2 hours and 49 minutes).

      - "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" has a runtime
      of approximately 143 minutes (2 hours and 23 minutes).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      - 143 minutes (Narnia) is less than 169 minutes (Aradhana).

      - Therefore, "The Chronicles of Narnia" is shorter than "Aradhana."


      NO. Shakti Samanta''s "Aradhana" is not shorter than Andrew Adamson''s "The
      Chronicles of Narnia." In fact, it''s the opposite - "Aradhana" is longer.'

      and their durations.


      Shakti Samanta''s "Aradhana" is a Bollywood film released in 1969. Bollywood
      films, especially from that era, tend to be quite long, often exceeding 2.5
      hours. I''ll need to recall the specific runtime for Aradhana.


      Andrew Adamson''s "The Chronicles of Narnia" refers to "The Chronicles of Narnia:
      The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" released in 2005. It''s a Hollywood fantasy
      film adaptation of C.S. Lewis''s novel.


      To the best of my knowledge:

      - Aradhana has a runtime of approximately 169 minutes (2 hours and 49 minutes)

      - The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe has a runtime
      of approximately 143 minutes (2 hours and 23 minutes)

      - "Phir Hera Pheri" (2006) - approximately 153 minutes

      - There was also a third film "Hera Pheri 3" that was announced but I believe

      - "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" (2004) is a single film directed by
      Adam McKay.

      - The "Hera Pheri series" includes multiple films, primarily "Hera Pheri" (2000)
      and "Phir Hera Pheri" (2006) directed by Priyadarshan.


      Step 2: Determine the runtime of "Anchorman."

      - "Anchorman" has a runtime of approximately 94 minutes.


      Step 3: Determine the runtime of the "Hera Pheri series."

      - "Hera Pheri" alone runs approximately 156 minutes.

      - "Phir Hera Pheri" runs approximately 153 minutes.

      - Combined, just these two films total over 300 minutes.


      Step 4: Compare the lengths.

      - Even just the first "Hera Pheri" film (156 minutes) is longer than "Anchorman"
      (94 minutes).

      - The entire series is significantly longer.


      YES, Adam McKay''s "Anchorman" is shorter than Priyadarshan''s "Hera Pheri series."'

      lengths of two movie properties: "Anchorman" directed by Adam McKay and the
      "Hera Pheri series" directed by Priyadarshan.


      First, let me identify what these movies are:


      1. Anchorman (full title "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy") is a 2004
      comedy film directed by Adam McKay, starring Will Ferrell. It''s a single movie
      with a runtime typically around 94 minutes (there may be extended versions,
      but the theatrical cut is this length).


      2. Hera Pheri series is an Indian comedy film series. The original "Hera Pheri"
      (2000) was directed by Priyadarshan, and there was at least one sequel called
      "Phir Hera Pheri" (2006). Each of these films would likely have runtimes between
      120-150 minutes, which is typical for Indian feature films.


      So:

      - Anchorman: ~94 minutes (single film)

      - Hera Pheri series: At least 2 films, likely 120+ minutes each, so at least
      240 minutes total for the series


      Since the question asks about Adam McKay''s Anchorman (single film) compared
      to Priyadarshan''s Hera Pheri series (multiple films), the answer would be YES
      - Anchorman is shorter than the Hera Pheri series.</think>To answer this question,
      I need to compare the length of Adam McKay''s "Anchorman" with Priyadarshan''s
      "Hera Pheri series."


      Step 1: Identify what "Anchorman" refers to.

      "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" is a 2004 comedy film directed by Adam
      McKay. Its runtime is approximately 94 minutes for the theatrical release.


      Step 2: Identify what the "Hera Pheri series" includes.

      The Hera Pheri series consists of multiple films, with the original "Hera Pheri"
      (2000) directed by Priyadarshan. This film alone runs approximately 155 minutes.
      The series includes at least one sequel, "Phir Hera Pheri" (2006).


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      Since "Anchorman" is a single film (94 minutes) while the "Hera Pheri series"
      consists of multiple films (with just the first film being longer than Anchorman),
      the series is definitely longer in total runtime.

      To answer this, I need to know the running time (duration) of each film.


      Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui is a 1990 Bollywood romantic drama film. I believe
      its running time is approximately 149 minutes.


      Takashi Shimizu''s The Grudge is a 2004 supernatural horror film (the American
      remake of the Japanese film Ju-On). I believe its running time is approximately

      So if these facts are correct:

      - Aashiqui: ~149 minutes

      - The Grudge: ~91-92 minutes

      The Grudge is a supernatural horror film with a runtime of approximately 91-92

      Mahesh Bhatt''s "Aashiqui" is shorter than Takashi Shimizu''s "The Grudge,"
      I need to compare their runtimes.


      Step 1: Identify the runtime of "Aashiqui" (1990).

      Mahesh Bhatt''s "Aashiqui" has a runtime of approximately 149 minutes (2 hours
      and 29 minutes).


      Step 2: Identify the runtime of "The Grudge" (2004).

      Takashi Shimizu''s "The Grudge" has a runtime of approximately 92 minutes (1
      hour and 32 minutes).


      Step 3: Compare the two runtimes.

      "Aashiqui" = 149 minutes

      "The Grudge" = 92 minutes

      149 minutes is greater than 92 minutes.


      Therefore, "Aashiqui" is longer than "The Grudge," not shorter.

    c10cc700-388b-4fb0-bea1-ce6447d16765: '<think>I need to compare the runtime lengths
      of two movies:

      1. Mahesh Bhatt''s "Aashiqui"

      2. Takashi Shimizu''s "The Grudge"


      Let me recall what I know about these films:


      Mahesh Bhatt''s "Aashiqui" is a 1990 Indian romantic drama film. I believe its
      runtime is approximately 150-160 minutes (about 2.5 hours), as is typical for
      Bollywood films of that era.


      Takashi Shimizu''s "The Grudge" is a 2004 American horror film (a remake of
      the Japanese film "Ju-On"). Horror films tend to be shorter, and I believe "The
      Grudge" has a runtime of around 90-100 minutes.


      Based on my knowledge, "The Grudge" (approximately 90-100 minutes) is shorter
      than "Aashiqui" (approximately 150-160 minutes).


      So the question is: Is Aashiqui shorter than The Grudge?

      The answer would be NO, because Aashiqui is likely longer than The Grudge.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to compare the runtimes of these two films.


      Step 1: Identify the movies in question.

      - "Aashiqui" (1990) is a Bollywood romantic drama film directed by Mahesh Bhatt

      - "The Grudge" (2004) is a horror film directed by Takashi Shimizu


      Step 2: Determine the runtime of each film.

      - "Aashiqui" has a runtime of approximately 149-150 minutes (2.5 hours), which
      is typical for Bollywood films of that era

      - "The Grudge" has a runtime of approximately 91-92 minutes (1.5 hours), which
      is standard for horror films


      Step 3: Compare the lengths.

      - "Aashiqui" at ~150 minutes is longer than "The Grudge" at ~92 minutes


      Therefore, is Mahesh Bhatt''s "Aashiqui" shorter than Takashi Shimizu''s "The
      Grudge"?


      NO'

      compare the lengths (runtimes) of two movies:

      1. Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui

      2. Takashi Shimizu''s The Grudge


      Let me recall the information about these films:


      Aashiqui (1990) is an Indian romantic drama film directed by Mahesh Bhatt. I
      believe its runtime is around 149 minutes (2 hours and 29 minutes).


      The Grudge (2004) is a Japanese-American supernatural horror film directed by
      Takashi Shimizu. Its runtime is approximately 91-92 minutes (1 hour and 31-32
      minutes).


      So comparing these two:

      - Aashiqui: ~149 minutes

      - The Grudge: ~91-92 minutes


      Since 149 minutes is greater than 91-92 minutes, Aashiqui is longer than The
      Grudge, not shorter.</think>I need to determine the runtime of each film to
      compare them.


      Mahesh Bhatt''s "Aashiqui" (1990) is an Indian romantic drama film with a runtime
      of approximately 149 minutes (2 hours and 29 minutes).


      Takashi Shimizu''s "The Grudge" (2004) is a Japanese-American supernatural horror
      film with a runtime of approximately 91-92 minutes (1 hour and 31-32 minutes).


      Comparing these two runtimes:

      - Aashiqui: ~149 minutes

      - The Grudge: ~91-92 minutes


      Since 149 minutes is greater than 91-92 minutes, Aashiqui is longer than The
      Grudge, not shorter.

      step by step:


      1. The question is comparing the lengths of two movies: "Aashiqui" directed
      by Mahesh Bhatt and "The Grudge" directed by Takashi Shimizu.


      2. I need to determine the runtime of each movie and compare them.


      For Mahesh Bhatt''s "Aashiqui":

      - This is a 1990 Bollywood romantic drama film.

      - The runtime of "Aashiqui" is approximately 149 minutes (2 hours and 29 minutes).


      For Takashi Shimizu''s "The Grudge":

      - This is a 2004 supernatural horror film (the American remake of the Japanese
      film "Ju-On").

      - The runtime of "The Grudge" is approximately 91-92 minutes (1 hour and 31-32
      minutes).


      3. Comparing the two:

      - "Aashiqui" is 149 minutes

      - "The Grudge" is about 92 minutes


      Since 149 minutes > 92 minutes, "Aashiqui" is longer than "The Grudge," not
      shorter.</think>To answer this question, I need to compare the runtimes of both
      movies.


      Step 1: Identify the runtime of Mahesh Bhatt''s "Aashiqui" (1990).

      - "Aashiqui" has a runtime of approximately 149 minutes (2 hours and 29 minutes).


      Step 2: Identify the runtime of Takashi Shimizu''s "The Grudge" (2004).

      - "The Grudge" has a runtime of approximately 91-92 minutes (1 hour and 31-32
      minutes).


      Step 3: Compare the two runtimes.

      - "Aashiqui" runs for 149 minutes

      - "The Grudge" runs for about 92 minutes

      - Since 149 > 92, "Aashiqui" is longer than "The Grudge," not shorter.
