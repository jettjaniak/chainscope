      The runtime for "Fifty Shades of Grey" (the first film) is about 125 minutes
      (2 hours and 5 minutes). However, since the question refers to James Foley''s
      direction, we should consider "Fifty Shades Darker" (2017), which has a runtime
      of about 118 minutes (1 hour and 58 minutes), or "Fifty Shades Freed" (2018),
      which runs for about 105 minutes (1 hour and 45 minutes).


      Given the information:

      - "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro" is approximately 132 minutes long.

      - "Fifty Shades Darker" is approximately 118 minutes long.

      - "Fifty Shades Freed" is approximately 105 minutes long.


      Since both films directed by James Foley ("Fifty Shades Darker" and "Fifty Shades
      Freed") are shorter than "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro," the answer to whether "Jaane
      Bhi Do Yaaro" is shorter than James Foley''s "Fifty Shades" (considering either
