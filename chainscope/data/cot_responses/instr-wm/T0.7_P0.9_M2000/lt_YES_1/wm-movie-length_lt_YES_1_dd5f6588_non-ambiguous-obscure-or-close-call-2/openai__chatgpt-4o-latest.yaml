      *Andaz Apna Apna* is shorter than Takashi Shimizu''s *The Grudge*, we need to:


      1. Determine the runtime of *Andaz Apna Apna*.

      2. Determine the runtime of *The Grudge* (the Japanese version directed by Takashi
      Shimizu, not the American remake).

      3. Compare the two durations.


      **Step 1: Runtime of Andaz Apna Apna**

      *Andaz Apna Apna* is a 1994 Indian comedy film directed by Rajkumar Santoshi.
      Its runtime is approximately 160 minutes (2 hours and 40 minutes).


      **Step 2: Runtime of The Grudge**

      Assuming we are referring to the original Japanese film directed by Takashi
      Shimizu, the relevant title is *Ju-On: The Grudge* (2002). Its runtime is approximately
      92 minutes (1 hour and 32 minutes).

      Bhi Do Yaaro" is shorter than James Foley''s "Fifty Shades", we need to compare
      their running times.


      Step 1: Find the runtime of "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro".

      - "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro" is a 1983 Indian satirical black comedy directed by Kundan
      Shah.

      - Its runtime is approximately 132 minutes (2 hours and 12 minutes).


      Step 2: Find the runtime of "Fifty Shades".

      - "Fifty Shades of Grey" is a 2015 American erotic romantic drama film directed
      by Sam Taylor-Johnson.

      - However, James Foley directed the sequels: "Fifty Shades Darker" (2017) and
      "Fifty Shades Freed" (2018).

      - Since the question refers to James Foley''s "Fifty Shades", we will take one
      of the sequels.


      Let''s take "Fifty Shades Darker" (2017), directed by James Foley:

      - Its runtime is approximately 118 minutes (1 hour and 58 minutes).


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes.

      - "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro" = 132 minutes.

      - "Fifty Shades Darker" = 118 minutes.


      132 minutes > 118 minutes.


      Therefore, "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro" is longer than "Fifty Shades Darker".
