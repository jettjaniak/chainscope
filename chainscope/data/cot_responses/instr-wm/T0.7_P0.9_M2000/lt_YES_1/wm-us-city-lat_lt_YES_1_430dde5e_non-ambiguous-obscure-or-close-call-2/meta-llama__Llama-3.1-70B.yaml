      \ DC, is the capital of the United States, located in the Mid-Atlantic region,\
      \ while Philadelphia, PA, is a city in the northeastern part of the country.\n\
      \n3. **Compare their latitudes**: Latitude is a key factor in determining how\
      \ far north or south a location is. The lower the latitude, the farther south\
      \ a place is.\n\n4. **Washington, DC latitude**: Washington, DC has a latitude\
      \ of approximately 38.90\xB0N.\n\n5. **Philadelphia, PA latitude**: Philadelphia,\
      \ PA has a latitude of approximately 39.95\xB0N.\n\n6. **Compare the latitudes**:\
      \ Since 38.90\xB0N (Washington, DC) is less than 39.95\xB0N (Philadelphia, PA),\
      \ Washington, DC is located south of Philadelphia in terms of latitude.\n\n\
      Therefore, based on their latitudes, Washington, DC is indeed located south\
      \ of Philadelphia, PA.\n\nYES"
