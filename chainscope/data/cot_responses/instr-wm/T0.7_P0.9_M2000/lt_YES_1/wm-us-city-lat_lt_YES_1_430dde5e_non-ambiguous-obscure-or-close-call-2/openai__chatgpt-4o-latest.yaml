      \ latitude \u2014 specifically, whether Orlando is at a lower latitude (i.e.,\
      \ farther south) than Denver.\n\n2. **Locate Denver, CO**: Denver is located\
      \ in the state of Colorado, which is in the central western part of the United\
      \ States. Denver is known as the \"Mile High City\" and is situated at a relatively\
      \ high elevation. In terms of latitude, Denver is approximately at 39.7\xB0\
      \ North.\n\n3. **Locate Orlando, FL**: Orlando is in central Florida, which\
      \ is in the southeastern United States. Florida extends quite far south compared\
      \ to much of the continental U.S. Orlando is located roughly at 28.5\xB0 North\
      \ latitude.\n\n4. **Compare the latitudes**: \n   - Denver: ~39.7\xB0 N\n  \
