      \ - Chicago is in Illinois, which is in the midwestern United States\n\n2. To\
      \ determine if Atlanta is south of Chicago, I'll mentally picture their relative\

      \   - On a map, Atlanta would be below Chicago's latitude\n\n3. Checking latitude\
      \ coordinates:\n   - Atlanta's latitude is approximately 33.7\xB0 N\n   - Chicago's\
      \ latitude is approximately 41.9\xB0 N\n\n4. Since Atlanta's latitude is lower\
