      Let me recall what I know about their positions:

      - The Bronx is one of the five boroughs of New York City, which is in the southeastern

      - Boston is in the northeastern part of Massachusetts.

      - The Bronx is in the northern part of New York City.

      - New York City (including the Bronx) is approximately 190-200 miles southwest
      of Boston.

      - On a map of the northeastern United States, Boston clearly appears above (north
      of) New York City.
