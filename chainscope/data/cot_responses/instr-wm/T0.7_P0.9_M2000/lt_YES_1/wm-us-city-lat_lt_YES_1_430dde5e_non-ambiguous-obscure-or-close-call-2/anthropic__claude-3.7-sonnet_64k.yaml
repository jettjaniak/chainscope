      Step 1: I need to determine the relative geographic positions of Los Angeles,
      CA and Seattle, WA within the United States.


      Step 2: Let me recall the locations of these cities:

      - Los Angeles is located in southern California, on the west coast of the United
      States.

      - Seattle is located in Washington state, which is also on the west coast of
      the United States but much further north.


      Step 3: In terms of north-south orientation in the United States:

      - Washington state borders Canada and is one of the northernmost states in the
      contiguous United States.

      - California extends along much of the west coast, with its southern portion
      reaching the Mexican border.


      Step 4: Specifically comparing the two cities:

      - Seattle is located in the northern part of Washington state, near the Canadian
      border.

      - Los Angeles is located in the southern part of California, relatively close
      to the Mexican border.


      Step 5: Considering the north-south orientation, Los Angeles is definitely south
      of Seattle on a map of the United States. If you were to draw a straight line
      from Seattle to Los Angeles, you would be moving in a southward direction.


      So, Los Angeles, CA is located south of Seattle, WA.</think>I''ll think about
      this step by step:


      1) First, I need to identify where both cities are located on the north-south
      axis of the United States.


      2) Seattle is located in Washington state, which is in the northwest corner
      of the contiguous United States, bordering Canada.


      3) Los Angeles is located in California, which is also on the west coast but
      extends much further south.


      4) Within their respective states, Seattle is in the northern part of Washington,
      while Los Angeles is in the southern part of California.


      5) California is directly south of Washington state on the west coast.


      6) Therefore, Los Angeles (in southern California) is definitely south of Seattle
      (in northern Washington).


      YES, Los Angeles, CA is located south of Seattle, WA.'

      \ latitude\n- Philadelphia, PA is located at approximately 39.9\xB0 North latitude\n\
      \nStep 2: Compare the latitudes.\n- In the northern hemisphere, lower latitude\
