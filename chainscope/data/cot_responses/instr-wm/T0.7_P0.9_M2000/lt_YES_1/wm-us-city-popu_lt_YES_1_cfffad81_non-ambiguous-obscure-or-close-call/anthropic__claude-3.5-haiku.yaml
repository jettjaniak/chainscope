      \ I'll recall the approximate populations of Austin and Seattle:\n\u2022 Austin,\
      \ TX population (as of recent estimates): Around 961,000\n\u2022 Seattle, WA\
      \ population (as of recent estimates): Around 737,000\n\n2. Comparing these\
      \ numbers directly:\n\u2022 Austin's population (961,000) is LARGER than Seattle's\
      \ population (737,000)\n\n3. The question asks: \"Is Austin, TX less populous\
      \ than Seattle, WA?\"\n\u2022 Since Austin is actually MORE populous than Seattle\n\
      \u2022 The answer would be: NO\n\nNO"
