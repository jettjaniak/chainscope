      - Born a Crime by Trevor Noah has 304 pages

      - The Day of the Jackal by Frederick Forsyth has 464 pages


      2. To answer if Born a Crime has fewer pages, I need to compare:

      304 < 464


      3. Since 304 is less than 464, Born a Crime does indeed have fewer pages than
      The Day of the Jackal.

      on edition)

      - The Shadow Rising by Robert Jordan is typically around 981-1,007 pages (depending
      on edition)


      2. Even accounting for different editions:

      - In Cold Blood''s highest page count (366) is still much lower than

      - The Shadow Rising''s lowest page count (981)


      3. The difference is very clear:

      - 366 < 981

      - The Shadow Rising is roughly three times longer


      Therefore:


      YES - In Cold Blood does have fewer pages than The Shadow Rising.'

      indeed have fewer pages.


      NO: "Quiet" has fewer pages than "Private Parts"

      picture book series. Each book typically contains around 24-32 pages of large
      illustrated scenes.


      2) The Empire Strikes Back by Donald F. Glut is a novelization of the Star Wars
      film. As a novel, it would need to contain the complete story with descriptions
      and dialogue.


      3) Checking references, The Empire Strikes Back novel is around 224 pages long.


      4) A typical Where''s Wally? book has far fewer pages than a standard novel,
      usually around 32 pages.
