      1. First, let me recall the page counts for both books:

      - In Cold Blood by Truman Capote is typically around 343-366 pages (depending
      on edition)

      - The Shadow Rising by Robert Jordan is typically around 981-1,007 pages (depending
      on edition)


      2. Even accounting for different editions:

      - In Cold Blood''s highest page count (366) is still much lower than

      - The Shadow Rising''s lowest page count (981)


      3. The difference is very clear:

      - 366 < 981

      - The Shadow Rising is roughly three times longer


      Therefore:


      YES - In Cold Blood does have fewer pages than The Shadow Rising.'

      1. First, let me recall the page counts of both books:

      - Susan Cain''s "Quiet" is approximately 352 pages

      - Howard Stern''s "Private Parts" is approximately 448 pages


      2. Now I can compare:

      352 < 448


      3. Since "Quiet" has 352 pages and "Private Parts" has 448 pages, "Quiet" does
      indeed have fewer pages.


      NO: "Quiet" has fewer pages than "Private Parts"
