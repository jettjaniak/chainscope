      3. **Comparison**: Comparing these ranges, "The Lost World" tends to have more
      pages than "The Talented Mr. Ripley" across most editions.


      Given the above considerations and the understanding that page counts can vary,
      the general trend suggests that "The Talented Mr. Ripley" has fewer pages than
      "The Lost World" in most editions.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'

      1. **Identify the books**: The first book mentioned is "Alexander and the Terrible,
      Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day" by Judith Viorst. The second book is "Built
      to Last" by James C. Collins.


      2. **Determine page counts**: To compare the page counts, we need to find the
      typical page counts for each book. However, page counts can vary significantly
      depending on the edition of the book. Different publishers may have different
      page counts for the same book due to variations in formatting, font size, and
      page size.


      3. **Average page count**: Since specific editions aren''t mentioned, we can
      look for average page counts or typical ranges for each book. "Alexander and
      the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day" is a children''s book and is
      generally around 30-40 pages, depending on the edition. "Built to Last" is a
      business book and typically ranges from 300 to over 400 pages, depending on
      the edition.


      4. **Comparison**: Comparing these ranges, "Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible,
      No Good, Very Bad Day" consistently has significantly fewer pages than "Built
      to Last" across most editions.


      Given the above considerations and the understanding that page counts can vary,
      the general trend suggests that "Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good,
      Very Bad Day" has fewer pages than "Built to Last" in most editions.

      1. **Page Count of The Silence of the Lambs**: The page count can vary depending
      on the edition of the book. However, a typical edition of The Silence of the
      Lambs by Thomas Harris usually ranges around 336 pages for a paperback edition,
      but this can vary from about 300 to over 400 pages depending on the publisher
      and the edition.


      2. **Page Count of The Stand**: Stephen King''s The Stand is known for being
      a lengthy novel. The complete and uncut edition of The Stand typically has around
      1153 pages for a paperback edition, though the page count can also vary by edition.
      Even the abridged version, which was the original form published, has a significant
      page count, often around 800-900 pages.


      Given these page count ranges:

      - The Silence of the Lambs: approximately 300-400 pages.

      - The Stand: approximately 800-1153 pages, depending on whether it''s the abridged
      or complete edition.


      Based on these ranges, The Silence of the Lambs consistently has fewer pages
      than The Stand, regardless of the edition considered.
