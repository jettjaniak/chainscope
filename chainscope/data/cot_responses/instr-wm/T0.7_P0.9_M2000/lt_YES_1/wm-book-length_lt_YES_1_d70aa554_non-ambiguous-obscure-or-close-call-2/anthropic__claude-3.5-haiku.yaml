      1. First, I''ll find the page count for Shiloh by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor:

      - Shiloh is a children''s novel

      - It''s typically around 130-150 pages long


      2. Next, I''ll find the page count for The Dragon Reborn by Robert Jordan:

      - This is a fantasy novel in the Wheel of Time series

      - It''s typically around 700-800 pages long


      3. Comparing the two page counts:

      - Shiloh: ~140 pages

      - The Dragon Reborn: ~750 pages


      4. Determining which has fewer pages:

      - 140 is less than 750

      - So Shiloh has fewer pages than The Dragon Reborn


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      3. Comparing the two page counts:

      - Rich Dad Poor Dad: ~220 pages

      - Hannibal: ~490 pages


      4. Determining which book has fewer pages:

      - Hannibal has significantly more pages than Rich Dad Poor Dad


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, Robert Kiyosaki''s Rich Dad Poor Dad does NOT
      have fewer pages than Thomas Harris''s Hannibal.'
