      by Robert A. Heinlein has fewer pages than *Clockwork Princess* by Cassandra
      Clare, we need to look at the typical page counts of both books.


      **Step 1: Check the approximate page count of *Starship Troopers***

      - *Starship Troopers*, first published in 1959, is a science fiction novel and
      is known to be relatively short.

      - Most standard editions of *Starship Troopers* are around 260-280 pages.


      **Step 2: Check the approximate page count of *Clockwork Princess***

      - *Clockwork Princess* is the third book in Cassandra Clare''s *The Infernal
      Devices* series, a young adult fantasy series.

      - It is significantly longer than Heinlein''s novel.

      - Most editions of *Clockwork Princess* are around 560-600 pages.


      **Step 3: Compare the page counts**

      - *Starship Troopers*: ~270 pages

      - *Clockwork Princess*: ~570 pages

    53adcf95-4d3d-4199-98e9-69c147542c00: 'To answer whether Sapphire''s *Push* has
      fewer pages than Sachin Tendulkar''s *Playing It My Way*, we need to:


      1. Determine the approximate page count of *Push* by Sapphire.

      2. Determine the approximate page count of *Playing It My Way* by Sachin Tendulkar.

      3. Compare the two page counts.


      Step 1: *Push* by Sapphire is a novel published in 1996. It is relatively short
      and is known to be a quick read. The typical edition has around 192 pages.


      Step 2: *Playing It My Way* is an autobiography by Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar,
      published in 2014. As an autobiography covering a long and detailed cricket
      career, it is significantly longer, with the hardcover edition containing about
      486 pages.


      Step 3: Compare the two:

      - *Push*: ~192 pages

      - *Playing It My Way*: ~486 pages


      192 < 486


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      Step 1: Identify the two books in question:

      - "Live and Let Die" by Ian Fleming

      - "12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos" by Jordan B. Peterson


      Step 2: Determine the approximate page count for each book:


      - "Live and Let Die" is the second James Bond novel by Ian Fleming. Most editions
      are between 240 and 260 pages long. Let''s take an average estimate of approximately
      250 pages.


      - "12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos" by Jordan B. Peterson is a modern
      nonfiction book. Most editions are between 400 and 450 pages. Let''s use an
      average of 430 pages.


      Step 3: Compare the two estimated page counts:

      - Live and Let Die: ~250 pages

      - 12 Rules for Life: ~430 pages


      Since 250 is less than 430, Live and Let Die has fewer pages.

      and the Giant Peach* has fewer pages than Rebecca Skloot''s *The Immortal Life
      of Henrietta Lacks*, we need to consider the typical page lengths of both books.


      1. **James and the Giant Peach** is a children''s novel written by Roald Dahl.
      Children''s novels typically have fewer pages, and this book is known for being
      relatively short. Most editions of *James and the Giant Peach* have about 150
      to 170 pages.


      2. **The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks** is a nonfiction book written for
      adults and includes scientific explanations, historical context, and biography.
      It is considerably longer. Most editions of *The Immortal Life of Henrietta
      Lacks* have around 350 to 400 pages.


      3. Comparing the two: approximately 160 pages (James and the Giant Peach) vs.
      approximately 370 pages (The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks).


      Based on this, *James and the Giant Peach* has significantly fewer pages than
      *The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks*.

      **Step 1: Identify the books and their authors**

      - "Room" by Emma Donoghue

      - "Eragon" by Christopher Paolini


      **Step 2: Determine the approximate number of pages in each book**


      - *Room* by Emma Donoghue typically has around **321 pages** (this may vary
      slightly depending on the edition, but this is a common figure for the original
      hardcover or paperback edition).


      - *Eragon* by Christopher Paolini typically has around **500 to 528 pages**,
      depending on the edition. Again, a common page count is **509 pages** for the

      **Step 3: Compare the number of pages**


      - Room: ~321 pages

      - Eragon: ~509 pages

      fewer pages than *The Fifth Season* by N. K. Jemisin.


      **Step 1: Identify the approximate page count of each book.**


      - *The Perks of Being a Wallflower* typically has around **213 to 240 pages**,

      step.


      Step 1: Identify the books in question.

      - "Sofies verden" is the original Norwegian title of "Sophie''s World" by Jostein
      Gaarder. It''s a philosophical novel aimed at young adults.

      - "The Dark Tower V" refers to "The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla" by Stephen
      King, the fifth book in The Dark Tower series.


      Step 2: Consider the typical page counts for each book.

      - "Sophie''s World" typically has around 400 to 500 pages depending on the edition
      and formatting. For example, the English paperback edition often has about 500
      pages.

      - "Wolves of the Calla" is one of Stephen King''s longer novels. It typically
      has around 700 to 900 pages, again depending on the edition. The standard hardcover
      edition, for example, has about 715 pages.


      Step 3: Compare the typical page counts.

      - "Sophie''s World": ~500 pages

      - "Wolves of the Calla": ~700+ pages

      1. *The Last Lecture* is a non-fiction book co-authored by Randy Pausch and
      Jeffrey Zaslow. It is relatively short, focusing on life lessons and reflections.
      The average page count for this book is approximately 206 pages.
