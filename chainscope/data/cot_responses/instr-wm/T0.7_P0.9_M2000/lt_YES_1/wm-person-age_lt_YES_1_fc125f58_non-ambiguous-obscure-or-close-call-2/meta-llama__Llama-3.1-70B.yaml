    f625066b-7c52-473d-aaf2-56aa1a21f938: 'To determine if Steve Jobs
      was younger at the time of death than Johannes Gutenberg, we need to know the
      ages of both individuals at the time of their deaths.


      1. **Steve Jobs'' Age at Death**: Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955,
      and died on October 5, 2011. This means he was 56 years old at the time of his
      death.


      2. **Johannes Gutenberg''s Age at Death**: Johannes Gutenberg was born around
      1398 (the exact date is unknown) and died on February 3, 1468. Assuming he was
      born in 1398, he would have been 70 years old at the time of his death.


      3. **Compare their ages at the time of death**: Steve Jobs was 56 years old,
      and Johannes Gutenberg was 70 years old.


      Given these facts, we can conclude that Steve Jobs was indeed younger than Johannes
      Gutenberg at the time of their respective deaths.

      1. **Jesse Owens**: Born on September 12, 1913, and died on March 31, 1980.
      This means he was 66 years old at the time of his death.

      1. **Grace Kelly''s Age at Death**: Grace Kelly was born on November 12, 1929,
      and died on September 14, 1982. Therefore, she was 52 years old at the time

      He was 76 years old at the time of his death.


      Now, let''s compare their ages at death:


      - Grace Kelly was 52 years old when she died.

      - Louis XIV was 76 years old when he died.


      Since 52 is less than 76, we can conclude that Grace Kelly was indeed younger

      1. **Find Virginia Woolf''s age at death**: Virginia Woolf was born on January
      25, 1882, and died on March 28, 1941. This means she was 59 years old when she
      died.


      2. **Find Jules Verne''s age at death**: Jules Verne was born on February 8,
      1828, and died on March 24, 1905. This means he was 77 years old when he died.


      3. **Compare their ages at death**: Now, we compare the ages of Virginia Woolf
      (59 years old) and Jules Verne (77 years old) at the time of their deaths to
      determine if Virginia Woolf was younger than Jules Verne at their respective

      we need to determine the ages of Ernest Hemingway and Johan Cruyff at the time
      of their respective deaths.


      1. **Ernest Hemingway''s Age at Death**: Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899,
      and died on July 2, 1961. This means he was 61 years old at the time of his
      death.


      2. **Johan Cruyff''s Age at Death**: Johan Cruyff was born on April 25, 1947,
      and died on March 24, 2016. This means he was 68 years old at the time of his

      5. **Compare the ages at death**: Now, we compare the ages of Malcolm X (39
      years, 9 months, and 2 days) and Alexander Hamilton (49 years, 6 months, and
      1 day) at the time of their deaths to determine if Malcolm X was younger than
      Alexander Hamilton at their respective times of death.


      Given that 39 years, 9 months, and 2 days is less than 49 years, 6 months, and
      1 day, Malcolm X was indeed younger at his time of death than Alexander Hamilton
      was at his time of death.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      1. **Jimi Hendrix''s age at death**: Jimi Hendrix was born on November 27, 1942,
      and died on September 18, 1970. This means he was 27 years old when he died.


      2. **Joseph Stalin''s age at death**: Joseph Stalin was born on December 18,
      1878, and died on March 5, 1953. This means he was 74 years old when he died.


      3. **Compare their ages at death**: Now, we compare the ages of Jimi Hendrix
      (27 years old) and Joseph Stalin (74 years old) at the time of their deaths
      to determine if Jimi Hendrix was younger than Joseph Stalin at their respective
      times of death.

      at the time of their deaths.


      1. **Find Lee Harvey Oswald''s age at death**: Lee Harvey Oswald was born on
      October 18, 1939, and died on November 24, 1963. This means he was 24 years
      old when he died.


      2. **Find Hans Christian Andersen''s age at death**: Hans Christian Andersen
      was born on April 2, 1805, and died on August 4, 1875. This means he was 70
      years old when he died.


      3. **Compare their ages at death**: Now, we compare the ages of Lee Harvey Oswald
      (24 years old) and Hans Christian Andersen (70 years old) at the time of their
      deaths to determine if Lee Harvey Oswald was younger than Hans Christian Andersen
      at their respective times of death.


      Given that 24 is less than 70, Lee Harvey Oswald was indeed younger at his time
      of death than Hans Christian Andersen at his time of death.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      we need to compare the ages of Stanley Kubrick and Dwight D. Eisenhower at the
      time of their deaths.


      1. **Find Stanley Kubrick''s age at death**: Stanley Kubrick was born on July
      26, 1928, and died on March 7, 1999. This means he was 70 years old when he
      died.


      2. **Find Dwight D. Eisenhower''s age at death**: Dwight D. Eisenhower was born
      on October 14, 1890, and died on March 28, 1969. This means he was 78 years
      old when he died.


      3. **Compare their ages at death**: Now, we compare the ages of Stanley Kubrick
      (70 years old) and Dwight D. Eisenhower (78 years old) at the time of their
      deaths to determine if Stanley Kubrick was younger than Dwight D. Eisenhower
      at their respective times of death.


      Given that 70 is less than 78, Stanley Kubrick was indeed younger at his time
      of death than Dwight D. Eisenhower at his time of death.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      1. **Martin Luther''s Age at Death**: Martin Luther was born on November 10,
      1483, and died on February 18, 1546. This means he was 62 years old at the time
      of his death.


      2. **Mark Twain''s Age at Death**: Mark Twain (real name Samuel Langhorne Clemens)
      was born on November 30, 1835, and died on April 21, 1910. This means he was
      74 years old at the time of his death.


      3. **Comparison**: Since Martin Luther was 62 years old at the time of his death,
      and Mark Twain was 74 years old at the time of his death, we can conclude that
      Martin Luther was indeed younger than Mark Twain at the time of their respective
