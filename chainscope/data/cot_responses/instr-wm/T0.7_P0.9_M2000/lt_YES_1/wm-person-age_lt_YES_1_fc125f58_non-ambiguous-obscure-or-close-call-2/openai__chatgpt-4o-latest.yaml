      younger at their time of death than Chuck Berry at their time of death?", let''s
      go through the steps:


      **Step 1: Determine Kim Jong-il''s age at death.**


      - Kim Jong-il was born on February 16, 1941 (although North Korea officially
      states 1942, most sources agree on 1941).

      - He died on December 17, 2011.


      So, if he was born in 1941 and died in 2011:

      2011 - 1941 = 70 years old.

      Since he died in December and was born in February, he had already turned 70.


      **Step 2: Determine Chuck Berry''s age at death.**


      - Chuck Berry was born on October 18, 1926.

      - He died on March 18, 2017.


      So, 2017 - 1926 = 91 years old.

      Since he died in March and was born in October, he had not yet turned 91, so
      he was 90 at the time of death.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**


      - Kim Jong-il: 70 years old.

      - Chuck Berry: 90 years old.

      - Charles de Gaulle was born on November 22, 1890.

      - He died on November 9, 1970.


      To calculate his age at death:

      - From November 22, 1890 to November 22, 1969 = 79 years.

      - He died on November 9, 1970, which is 13 days before his 80th birthday.


      Therefore, Charles de Gaulle was 79 years old when he died.


      **Step 2: Determine Max Weber''s age at death.**


      - Max Weber was born on April 21, 1864.

      - He died on June 14, 1920.


      To calculate his age at death:

      - From April 21, 1864 to April 21, 1920 = 56 years.

      - He died on June 14, 1920, which is about 2 months after his 56th birthday.


      Therefore, Max Weber was 56 years old when he died.


      **Step 3: Compare the ages.**


      - Charles de Gaulle: 79 years old at death.

      step.


      Step 1: Determine Anne Frank''s birth and death dates.

      - Anne Frank was born on June 12, 1929.

      - She died in February or March 1945 (exact date unknown, but often approximated
      as March 1945).


      So, assuming she died in March 1945:

      - From June 12, 1929, to June 12, 1944 = 15 years.

      - From June 12, 1944, to March 1945 = about 9 months.


      Therefore, Anne Frank was about 15 years and 9 months old at the time of her
      death.


      Step 2: Determine Kobe Bryant''s birth and death dates.

      - Kobe Bryant was born on August 23, 1978.

      - He died on January 26, 2020.


      So, from August 23, 1978, to August 23, 2019 = 41 years.

      Walt Disney, and then compare the two.


      **Step 1: Determine Peter I''s age at death**


      - Peter I was born on June 9, 1672 (Gregorian calendar).

      at the time of death.


      **Step 2: Determine Walt Disney''s age at death**


      - Walt Disney was born on December 5, 1901.

      - He died on December 15, 1966.

      - From December 5, 1901 to December 5, 1966 is 65 years.

      - He died on July 29, 1890.


      From March 30, 1853, to March 30, 1890, is exactly 37 years.

      He died in July 1890, which is a few months after his 37th birthday.

      So, Vincent van Gogh was 37 years old when he died.


      **Step 2: Determine Oskar Schindler''s age at the time of death.**


      - Oskar Schindler was born on April 28, 1908.

      - He died on October 9, 1974.


      From April 28, 1908, to April 28, 1974, is exactly 66 years.

      He died in October 1974, several months after his 66th birthday.

      **Step 3: Compare the two ages.**


      - Vincent van Gogh: 37 years old at death

      - Oskar Schindler: 66 years old at death


      **Conclusion:**

      - A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was born on October 15, 1931.

      - He died on July 27, 2015.

      - From October 15, 1931 to October 15, 2014 is 83 years.

      - He died in July 2015, just a few months short of turning 84.

      - So he was 83 years old when he died.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Isaac Asimov: 72 years old.

      - A. P. J. Abdul Kalam: 83 years old.


      Since 72 < 83, Isaac Asimov was younger at the time of his death.

      younger at their time of death than Queen Victoria at their time of death?"
      let''s break it down step by step.


      Step 1: Determine Bob Marley''s age at death.

      - Bob Marley was born on February 6, 1945.

      - Queen Victoria was born on May 24, 1819.

      - She died on January 22, 1901.

      - From May 24, 1819 to May 24, 1900 is 81 years.

      - She died a few months before her 82nd birthday, so she was 81 years old when

      Step 1: Determine the age at death of Richard I.

      - Richard I of England (also known as Richard the Lionheart) was born on September
      8, 1157.

      - He died on April 6, 1199.

      - To calculate his age at death: From 1157 to 1199 is 42 years, but since he
      died before his birthday in 1199, he was 41 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 2: Determine the age at death of Agatha Christie.

      - Agatha Christie was born on September 15, 1890.

      - She died on January 12, 1976.

      - From 1890 to 1976 is 86 years, but since she died before her birthday in 1976,
      she was 85 years old at the time of her death.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Richard I died at age 41.

      - Agatha Christie died at age 85.


      Conclusion: Richard I was younger at the time of his death than Agatha Christie.


      Answer: YES.'
    f20cff50-df20-408b-908d-9e1cef55925b: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the age at death for both Richard I (also known as Richard the Lionheart) and
      Agatha Christie, then compare them.


      **Step 1: Find Richard I''s age at death**

      - Richard I was born on September 8, 1157.

      - He died on April 6, 1199.


      To calculate his age at death:

      - From September 8, 1157, to September 8, 1198 = 41 years.

      - He died in April 1199, which is about 7 months after his 41st birthday.

      - So, he was 41 years old at the time of his death.


      **Step 2: Find Agatha Christie''s age at death**

      - Agatha Christie was born on September 15, 1890.

      - She died on January 12, 1976.


      To calculate her age at death:

      - From September 15, 1890, to September 15, 1975 = 85 years.

      - She died in January 1976, about 4 months after her 85th birthday.

      - So, she was 85 years old at the time of her death.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death**

      - Richard I died at age 41.

      - Agatha Christie died at age 85.


      So, Richard I was younger at the time of his death than Agatha Christie.

    8d2d2f9f-52e9-4a62-bd6c-031c32c12baf: 'To answer whether Selena Quintanilla was
      younger at the time of her death than Maya Angelou, we need to determine the
      ages at which both individuals died.


      **Step 1: Determine Selena Quintanilla''s age at death.**


      - Selena Quintanilla was born on April 16, 1971.

      - She died on March 31, 1995.


      To calculate her age:

      - From April 16, 1971 to April 16, 1994 = 23 years.

      - She died just before her 24th birthday in 1995, so she was 23 years old at
      the time of her death.


      **Step 2: Determine Maya Angelou''s age at death.**


      - Maya Angelou was born on April 4, 1928.

      - She died on May 28, 2014.


      To calculate her age:

      - From April 4, 1928 to April 4, 2014 = 86 years.

      - She died in May 2014, so she was 86 years old at the time of her death.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**


      - Selena Quintanilla: 23 years old.

      - Maya Angelou: 86 years old.


      Since 23 is less than 86, Selena Quintanilla was younger at the time of her
      death than Maya Angelou.


      **Answer: YES.**'

      - So, Selena was 23 years old when she died.


      Step 2: Determine Maya Angelou''s age at the time of her death.

      - Maya Angelou was born on April 4, 1928.

      - She died on May 28, 2014.

      - From April 4, 1928 to April 4, 2014 is 86 years.

      - From April 4, 2014 to May 28, 2014 is almost 2 months.

      - So, Maya Angelou was 86 years old when she died.


      Step 3: Compare the two ages.

      the ages at which Malcolm X and Alexander Hamilton died, and then compare them.


      **Step 1: Determine Malcolm X''s age at death.**

      - Malcolm X was born on May 19, 1925.

      - He died on February 21, 1965.


      So, from May 19, 1925, to May 19, 1964, he turned 39 years old.

      He died in February 1965, before his 40th birthday.

      Therefore, Malcolm X was 39 years old when he died.

      - Alexander Hamilton was born on January 11, 1755 (or possibly 1757; there is
      some historical debate, but the commonly used year is 1755).

      - He died on July 12, 1804.

      - From January 11, 1755, to January 11, 1804, he turned 49.

      - He died in July 1804, so he was still 49.


      Therefore, Alexander Hamilton was 49 years old when he died (if using the 1755
      birth year).


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**

      - Malcolm X: 39 years old.

      Malcolm X was younger at the time of his death than Alexander Hamilton.

      Step 1: Malcolm X

      - Born: May 19, 1925

      - Died: February 21, 1965


      To calculate Malcolm X''s age:

      From May 19, 1925 to May 19, 1964 = 39 years

      From May 19, 1964 to February 21, 1965 = about 9 months short of his 40th birthday

      So, Malcolm X was 39 years old when he died.


      Step 2: Alexander Hamilton

      - Born: January 11, 1755 or 1757 (there is some historical debate, but we will
      consider both)

      - Died: July 12, 1804


      If he was born in 1755:

      From January 11, 1804 to July 12, 1804 = 6 months

      So, he would have been 49 years old.


      If he was born in 1757:

      - He died on August 16, 2003.

      - Assuming he was born in 1925, he would have been about 78 years old at the

      - From November 27, 1969 to September 18, 1970 is just short of 10 months.

      - Therefore, Jimi Hendrix was 27 years old when he died.


      Step 2: Determine Joseph Stalin''s age at death.

      - Joseph Stalin was born on December 18, 1878.

      - He died on March 5, 1953.

      - From December 18, 1878 to December 18, 1952 is 74 years.

      - From December 18, 1952 to March 5, 1953 is about 2.5 months.

      - Therefore, Joseph Stalin was 74 years old when he died.


      Step 3: Compare the ages.

      - Jimi Hendrix: 27 years old.

      - Joseph Stalin: 74 years old.


      Since 27 is less than 74, Jimi Hendrix was younger at his time of death than
      Joseph Stalin.

      **Step 1: Determine the age at death of Francis of Assisi.**

      - Francis of Assisi was born in 1181 or 1182.

      - He died in 1226.

      - If he was born in 1181, he would have been 45 at death.

      **Step 2: Determine the age at death of Alfred Hitchcock.**

      - Alfred Hitchcock was born in 1899.

      - He died in 1980.

      - 1980 - 1899 = 81 years old at death.

      the answer.


      Step 1: Determine when Emily Dickinson was born and when she died.

      - Emily Dickinson was born in 1830 and died in 1886.

      - So, she lived: 1886 - 1830 = 56 years.


      Step 2: Determine when Walter Cronkite was born and when he died.

      - Walter Cronkite was born in 1916 and died in 2009.

      - Heath Ledger was born on April 4, 1979.

      - He died on January 22, 2008.

      - From April 4, 1979 to April 4, 2007 = 28 years.

      - From April 4, 2007 to January 22, 2008 is less than a year.

      - So Heath Ledger was 28 years old at the time of his death.


      **Step 2: Determine Franz Kafka''s age at death.**

      - Franz Kafka was born on July 3, 1883.

      - He died on June 3, 1924.

      - From July 3, 1883 to July 3, 1923 = 40 years.

      - So, he died before his birthday in 1954.

      - From December 31, 1869 to December 31, 1953 is 84 years.

      - Since he died before his 85th birthday in 1954, he was 84 years old when he
      died.


      Step 2: Find out how old Nelson Mandela was when he died.

      - Nelson Mandela was born on July 18, 1918.

      - He died on December 5, 2013.

      - From July 18, 1918 to July 18, 2013 is 95 years.

      younger at the time of his death than Alighiero di Bellincione, we need to find
      the age at death for both individuals.


      Step 1: Determine Osama bin Laden''s age at death.

      - Osama bin Laden was born on March 10, 1957.

      - He died on May 2, 2011.

      - From 1957 to 2011 is 54 years.

      - Since he died after his birthday in 2011, he was 54 years old at the time
      of his death.


      Step 2: Determine Alighiero di Bellincione''s age at death.

      - Alighiero di Bellincione was the father of Dante Alighieri, and he lived in
      the 13th century.

      - Historical records suggest he was born around 1210 and died around 1283.

      - That would make him approximately 73 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 3: Compare the two ages.

      - Osama bin Laden: 54 years old.
