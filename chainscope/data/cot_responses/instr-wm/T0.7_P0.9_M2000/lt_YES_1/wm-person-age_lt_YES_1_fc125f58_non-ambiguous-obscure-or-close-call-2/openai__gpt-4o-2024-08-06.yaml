      the ages at which Che Guevara and Vasco da Gama died.


      1. Che Guevara was born on June 14, 1928, and died on October 9, 1967.

      2. Vasco da Gama was born around 1460 (exact date unknown, often cited as 1460
      or 1469) and died on December 24, 1524.


      First, let''s calculate Che Guevara''s age at death:

      - From June 14, 1928, to June 14, 1967, is 39 years.

      - From June 14, 1967, to October 9, 1967, is an additional 3 months and 25 days.

      - Therefore, Che Guevara was 39 years old when he died.


      Next, let''s calculate Vasco da Gama''s age at death assuming he was born in
      1460:

      - From 1460 to 1524 is 64 years.

      - Since we don''t have an exact birth date, we''ll assume he reached his birthday
      in 1524, making him 64 years old when he died.


      If Vasco da Gama was born in 1469, he would have been 55 years old at his time
      of death. However, the commonly accepted birth year is 1460.


      Comparing their ages at death:

      - Che Guevara was 39 years old.

      - Vasco da Gama was 64 years old (assuming a birth year of 1460).


      So, Che Guevara was indeed younger at the time of his death than Vasco da Gama.

      1. **Francis of Assisi**: Born in 1181 or 1182 (exact year is uncertain), he
      died on October 3, 1226. Assuming he was born in 1181, he would have been 45
      years old at the time of his death. If he was born in 1182, he would have been
      44 years old.


      2. **Alfred Hitchcock**: Born on August 13, 1899, he died on April 29, 1980.
      This makes him 80 years old at the time of his death.


      Comparing the ages:


      - Francis of Assisi: 44 or 45 years old

      - Alfred Hitchcock: 80 years old


      Francis of Assisi was younger at the time of his death compared to Alfred Hitchcock.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.'

      1. **Friedrich Nietzsche**: He was born on October 15, 1844, and died on August
      25, 1900. This means he was 55 years old when he passed away.


      2. **Indira Gandhi**: She was born on November 19, 1917, and died on October
      31, 1984. This means she was 66 years old when she passed away.


      Comparing their ages at death, Friedrich Nietzsche was 55 years old and Indira
      Gandhi was 66 years old.


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: YES, Friedrich Nietzsche was younger
      at the time of his death than Indira Gandhi was at the time of her death.'
