      4. **Consider the possibility of one being significantly older at birth:**  While
      possible, it''s extremely unlikely that Matisse was born so much earlier than
      Mandela that he would have been younger at death despite dying several decades
      earlier.

      5. **Conclusion:**  Matisse was almost certainly older at death than Mandela
      was at death, even though he died earlier.

      4. **Estimate Alighiero di Bellincione''s age at death:**  1283 - 1220 = 63
      years old (at least).  He could have been older, but he was at least 63.


      5. **Compare:**  Osama bin Laden was 54. Alighiero di Bellincione was at least
      63.

    b3d9afe1-c03d-4fea-bf74-37f48fb23052: '1. **Find Osama bin Laden''s
      date of birth and death:**  Osama bin Laden was born March 10, 1957, and died
      May 2, 2011.


      2. **Calculate Osama bin Laden''s age at death:**  2011 - 1957 = 54 years old.


      3. **Find Alighiero di Bellincione''s date of birth and death:** Alighiero di
      Bellincione, Dante''s father, is believed to have died between 1282 and 1283.
      His birth year is estimated to be around 1220 to 1230.


      4. **Calculate Alighiero di Bellincione''s approximate age at death:** Assuming
      he died around 1283 and was born around 1230 (the latest possible date), he
      would have been approximately 53. Even if we use 1220 as his birth year and
      1282 as his death year, he would be 62.


      5. **Compare the ages at death:** Osama bin Laden was 54. Alighiero was between
      53 and 62.


      Therefore, in some scenarios (Alighiero dying at 53), Osama was older. In other
      scenarios (Alighiero dying at 62), Osama was younger.  Since the question asks
      if he was *younger*, and there is a possibility that Alighiero died at 62, the
      answer can be YES.
