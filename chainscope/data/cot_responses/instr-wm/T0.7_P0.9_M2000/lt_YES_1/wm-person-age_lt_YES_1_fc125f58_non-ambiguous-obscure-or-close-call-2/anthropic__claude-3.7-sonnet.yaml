      Step 2: Find out when John Adams lived and died, and calculate his age at death.

      - John Adams lived from October 30, 1735, to July 4, 1826.

      - At his death, Adams was 90 years old.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Alfred Nobel died at 63 years old.

      - John Adams died at 90 years old.

      - 63 is less than 90.


      Therefore, Alfred Nobel was younger at his time of death than John Adams was
      at his time of death.

      Step 1: Determine when Ali ibn Abi Talib died and at what age.

      - Ali ibn Abi Talib was born around 601 CE and died in 661 CE.

      - This means Ali was approximately 60 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 2: Determine Jimmy Carter''s situation.

      - Jimmy Carter was born on October 1, 1924.

      - Jimmy Carter is still alive as of my last update (2023).

      - As of 2023, Carter is approximately 99 years old.


      Step 3: Compare the ages at death.

      - Ali ibn Abi Talib died at approximately 60 years of age.

      - Jimmy Carter is still living and is 99 years old.

      - Since Carter is still alive, his "age at death" is not yet determined, but
      it will be at least 99.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - 60 years (Ali) is less than 99+ years (Carter''s minimum age at death).

      - 60 is less than 99.


      Therefore, Ali ibn Abi Talib was younger at his time of death than Jimmy Carter''s

      the ages of both Grigori Rasputin and Franklin Delano Roosevelt at their respective
      deaths.


      Step 1: Find Rasputin''s birth and death dates.

      - Grigori Rasputin was born on January 21, 1869

      - He died on December 30, 1916


      Step 2: Calculate Rasputin''s age at death.

      - From January 21, 1869 to December 30, 1916

      - This makes him 47 years, 11 months, and 9 days old when he died


      Step 3: Find Roosevelt''s birth and death dates.

      - Franklin Delano Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882

      - He died on April 12, 1945


      Step 4: Calculate Roosevelt''s age at death.

      - From January 30, 1882 to April 12, 1945

      - This makes him 63 years, 2 months, and 13 days old when he died

      Step 1: Let me determine when Grace Kelly died and at what age.

      - Grace Kelly died in 1982 following a car accident.

      - She was born in 1929.

      - This means she was about 52-53 years old at the time of her death.

      Step 1: Find out when Che Guevara was born and when he died.

      - Che Guevara was born on June 14, 1928

      - He died on October 9, 1967


      Step 2: Calculate Che Guevara''s age at death.

      - Che Guevara was 39 years old when he died (1967 - 1928 = 39)


      Step 3: Find out when Vasco da Gama was born and when he died.

      - Vasco da Gama was born around 1460 (some sources say 1469)

      - He died on December 24, 1524


      Step 4: Calculate Vasco da Gama''s age at death.

      - Using 1460 as birth year: 1524 - 1460 = 64 years old

      - Using 1469 as birth year: 1524 - 1469 = 55 years old

      - Either way, he was in his mid-50s to mid-60s when he died


      Step 5: Compare the ages at death.

      - Che Guevara: 39 years old

      - Vasco da Gama: approximately 55-64 years old


      Since 39 is less than both 55 and 64, Che Guevara was younger at his time of
      death than Vasco da Gama.

      - At his death, he was 54 years old.


      Step 2: Identify who Alighiero di Bellincione was and when he died.

      - Alighiero di Bellincione was Dante Alighieri''s father.

      - While I don''t have the exact dates of his birth and death, historical records
      indicate he died when Dante was young, likely in his 40s or 50s.

      - Dante was born in 1265, and his father died before Dante reached adulthood,
      likely in the 1270s.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Osama bin Laden died at 54 years old.

      - Alighiero di Bellincione likely died in his 40s or 50s.


      Based on the available historical information, while I cannot be completely
      certain due to limited precise records about Alighiero di Bellincione, it appears
      that both men died at roughly similar ages, with Alighiero possibly dying slightly
      younger.


      NO (though with some historical uncertainty due to incomplete records about
      Alighiero di Bellincione''s exact age at death)'

      Laden and Alighiero di Bellincione at their respective deaths.


      Step 1: Find Osama bin Laden''s lifespan.

      Osama bin Laden was born on March 10, 1957, and died on May 2, 2011. This makes
      him 54 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 2: Find Alighiero di Bellincione''s lifespan.

      Alighiero di Bellincione was the father of Dante Alighieri (the famous poet).
      While exact birth and death dates aren''t as well documented for medieval figures,
      historical records indicate he died around 1283. He was likely in his 60s or
      70s at death, based on typical lifespans of that era and the fact that he had
      an adult son.


      Step 3: Compare the ages.

      Osama bin Laden died at 54 years old, while Alighiero di Bellincione likely
      died in his 60s or 70s.


      Therefore, Osama bin Laden was younger at his time of death than Alighiero di

      Osama bin Laden was born on March 10, 1957, and died on May 2, 2011. This means
      he was 54 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 2: Determine when Alighiero di Bellincione lived and died.

      Alighiero di Bellincione was Dante Alighieri''s father. While exact birth and
      death dates are not as well-documented for medieval figures, historical records
      suggest he died around 1283. He was likely in his 50s or 60s at death, though

      Based on the available information, Osama bin Laden died at 54 years of age.
      Alighiero di Bellincione likely died in his 50s or 60s.


      Given the uncertainty about Alighiero''s exact age at death but the likelihood

      was younger at death. If Alighiero died in his late 50s or 60s, then bin Laden

      he was 54 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 2: Determine Alighiero di Bellincione''s age at death.

      Alighiero di Bellincione was Dante Alighieri''s father. Historical records about

      1283. Alighiero di Bellincione was likely born in the early to mid-13th century.

      era, likely in his 50s or 60s.


      Step 3: Compare the ages.

      Given the limited information about Alighiero di Bellincione, I cannot make
      a definitive comparison with complete certainty. However, based on historical
      context of lifespans in the 13th century, it''s reasonable to conclude that
