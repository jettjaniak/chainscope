      \ The question is whether Tchaikovsky was younger when he died compared to Louis\
      \ Pasteur when he died. So I need to find out both of their death dates and\
      \ their birth dates, then calculate their ages at death.\n\nFirst, let me recall\
      \ some basic facts. Tchaikovsky was a famous Russian composer, known for works\
      \ like Swan Lake and The Nutcracker. Louis Pasteur was a French scientist who\
      \ did a lot of work in microbiology and developed pasteurization. \n\nI think\
      \ Tchaikovsky died in the late 19th century. Let me check the years. From what\
      \ I remember, he was born in 1840 and died in 1893. That would make him 53 years\
      \ old when he died. Wait, let me confirm. If he was born in 1840, subtracting\
      \ that from 1893 gives 53. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, Louis Pasteur. I\
      \ believe he lived into the late 19th or early 20th century. Wait, no, Pasteur\
      \ was born in 1822. So if he was born in 1822, how old was he when he died?\
      \ His death year, I think, was 1895. So 1895 minus 1822 is 73. That makes him\
      \ 73 when he died. Wait, is that accurate? Let me think again. Pasteur's major\
      \ work was in the 1860s and onwards. If he died in 1895, that would fit. Yeah,\
      \ I'm pretty sure he died in 1895.\n\nSo Tchaikovsky died in 1893 at 53, and\
      \ Pasteur died in 1895 at 73. So yes, Tchaikovsky was younger at the time of\
      \ his death than Pasteur was. So the answer should be YES. Wait, let me just\
      \ double-check the birth and death years again to be sure. \n\nTchaikovsky:\

      \ he died.\n</think>To determine if Tchaikovsky was younger at his death than\
      \ Pasteur, we compare their lifespans:  \n- **Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky**: Born\

      \ Born 1822, died 1895 \u2192 **73 years old** at death.  \n\nSince 53 < 73,\
      \ **YES**, Tchaikovsky was younger at the time of his death.  \n\nANSWER: YES"
    23f1ef7c-8e60-40b9-be06-c872cc517319: "<think>Alright, let's try to figure this\

      \ and death years, then calculate their ages at death, and compare them.\n\n\
      Okay, starting with Tchaikovsky. From what I remember, he was a Russian composer\
      \ famous for works like Swan Lake and The Nutcracker. I think he lived during\
      \ the 19th century. Let me try to recall his birth and death years. I believe\
      \ he was born in 1840 and died in 1893. Wait, that would make him 53 years old\
      \ when he died. Hmm, but I should double-check that. Maybe he died a bit later?\
      \ No, I think 1893 is right because there's a famous story about his death possibly\
      \ being a suicide due to a scandal, but I'm not sure about the exact dates.\n\
      \nNow, Louis Pasteur. He was a French microbiologist and chemist known for pasteurization\
      \ and vaccines. His work was in the 19th century as well. Let me think. He was\
      \ born in 1822, right? And he died in 1895. So if he was born in 1822 and died\
      \ in 1895, that would make him 73 years old. Wait, 1895 minus 1822 is indeed\
      \ 73. \n\nSo comparing the two: Tchaikovsky died at 53 (if he was born in 1840\
      \ and died in 1893) and Pasteur at 73. So yes, Tchaikovsky was younger at the\
      \ time of his death. But I need to confirm their exact birth and death years\
      \ to be sure. \n\nWait, let me verify Tchaikovsky's dates again. Pyotr Ilyich\
      \ Tchaikovsky: Born May 7, 1840, died November 6, 1893. So that's 53 years old.\
      \ Louis Pasteur: Born December 27, 1822, died September 28, 1895. So 1895 minus\
      \ 1822 is 73. Therefore, Tchaikovsky was 53, Pasteur was 73. So the answer is\
      \ YES, Tchaikovsky was younger when he died than Pasteur was when he died.\n\
      </think>YES. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky died in 1893 at age 53 (born 1840), while\
      \ Louis Pasteur died in 1895 at age 72 (born 1822). Thus, Tchaikovsky was younger\
      \ at his time of death. \n\n**Answer:** YES"

      First, I should recall their birth and death years. Let''s start with Tchaikovsky.
      From what I remember, he was a Russian composer known for works like Swan Lake
      and The Nutcracker. I think he was born in 1840. His death... wasn''t there
      some controversy around it? Like cholera or something? Maybe around 1893. Let

      \ the time of his death than Pasteur. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n\
      </think>Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 and died in 1893 at age 53. Pasteur was\

      \ The question is asking if Leonardo da Vinci was younger when he died than\
      \ Niccol\xF2 Machiavelli was when he died. So I need to compare their ages at\
      \ death.\n\nFirst, I need to know the birth and death years of both people.\
      \ Let me start with Leonardo da Vinci. From what I remember, Leonardo was born\
      \ in 1452 and died in 1519. Let me confirm that. Yeah, I think that's right\u2014\
      he's known for works like the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, and he was a Renaissance\
      \ man, so that timeline makes sense.\n\nNow, Niccol\xF2 Machiavelli. He's famous\
      \ for writing \"The Prince.\" I believe he was born in 1469 and died in 1527.\
      \ Wait, was that his death year? Let me think. The Prince was published after\
      \ his death, I think, but his death year was around the mid-1520s. Yeah, 1527\
      \ sounds right.\n\nSo let's calculate their ages. For Leonardo: he died in 1519,\
      \ born in 1452. Subtract 1452 from 1519. 1519 minus 1452... that's 67 years\
      \ old. Wait, 1519 - 1452. Let me do the math again. 1452 + 67 = 1519. Yes, so\
      \ 67 years old when he died.\n\nNow Machiavelli: born 1469, died 1527. 1527\
      \ minus 1469. Let's compute that. 1527 - 1469. Let's subtract 1469 from 1527.\
      \ 1527 - 1400 = 127, then subtract 69 more: 127 - 69 = 58. So he was 58 years\
      \ old when he died.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 1469 + 58 = 1527. Yes,\
      \ because 1469 + 50 = 1519, then add 8 more years gets to 1527. So 58 years\
      \ old.\n\nSo Leonardo died at 67, Machiavelli at 58. So the question is: Was\
      \ Leonardo younger at death than Machiavelli? No, because 67 is older than 58.\
      \ So the answer would be NO. Because Machiavelli died younger (58) than Leonardo\
      \ (67). So Leonardo was older at death, so he wasn't younger. Therefore, the\
      \ answer is NO.\n</think>NO  \nLeonardo da Vinci was born in 1452 and died in\
      \ 1519, making him 67 years old at his death. Niccol\xF2 Machiavelli was born\
      \ in 1469 and died in 1527, dying at age 58. Since 67 (Leonardo) is greater\

      \ with Leonardo da Vinci. His birth year is 1452, if I recall correctly. His\
      \ death year, I think he died in 1519. So if he was born in 1452 and died in\
      \ 1519, his age at death would be 1519 minus 1452. Let me calculate that: 1519\
      \ minus 1452 is 67 years old. Wait, 1452 + 67 would be 1519, yes, that's right.\
      \ So da Vinci was 67 when he died.\n\nNow, Niccol\xF2 Machiavelli. I'm less\
      \ sure about his dates. I think he was born in 1469. His death year... I believe\
      \ he died in 1527. Let me confirm that. If he was born in 1469 and died in 1527,\
      \ subtracting 1469 from 1527 gives his age. 1527 minus 1469: let's see, 1527\
      \ - 1469. So 1527 - 1400 is 127, then subtract 69 more: 127 - 69 = 58. Wait,\
      \ that can't be right. Wait, no, 1527 minus 1469. Let's do this step by step.\
      \ 1469 + 58 = 1527? Let's check. 1469 + 50 = 1519, then +8 = 1527. Yes, so he\
      \ was 58 when he died. \n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because I thought\
      \ Machiavelli was a contemporary of da Vinci but maybe a bit younger. But according\
      \ to these dates, da Vinci died in 1519 at 67, and Machiavelli died in 1527\
      \ at 58. So that would mean Machiavelli was younger when he died. Wait, but\
      \ the question is asking if da Vinci was younger at his time of death than Machiavelli\
      \ was at his. So da Vinci's age at death: 67, Machiavelli's: 58. So 67 is older\
      \ than 58, so the answer would be NO, because da Vinci was older when he died\
      \ than Machiavelli.\n\nWait, but I want to make sure the dates are correct.\
      \ Let me double-check. For Leonardo da Vinci, born April 15, 1452, died May\
      \ 2, 1519. That's correct, so 1519 - 1452 = 67 years. For Machiavelli, born\
      \ May 3, 1469, died June 21, 1527. So 1527 - 1469 = 58 years. Yes, so Machiavelli\
      \ died at 58, da Vinci at 67. Therefore, da Vinci was older. So the question\
      \ is, was Leonardo younger than Machiavelli at their time of death? The answer\
      \ is NO, because 67 is greater than 58. Therefore, NO, Leonardo was not younger;\
      \ he was older.\n</think>NO  \nLeonardo da Vinci was born in 1452 and died in\
      \ 1519, living to 67 years old. Niccol\xF2 Machiavelli was born in 1469 and\
      \ died in 1527, living to 58 years old. Since 67 > 58, da Vinci was older at\
      \ his death than Machiavelli was at his. The answer is NO."

    1e557ac1-b673-4859-aa39-772c8120a1fa: '<think>Okay, let''s try to figure this
      out. The question is whether Kim Jong-il was younger at his time of death than
      Chuck Berry was at his time of death. So I need to find out the birth years
      and death years of both people, calculate their ages when they died, and then
      compare them.


      First, Kim Jong-il. I know he was the leader of North Korea before his son Kim
      Jong-un. From what I remember, he died in 2011. His birth year... I think he
      was born in 1941 or 1942. Wait, I recall there was some controversy about his
      birth year because North Korean propaganda sometimes changes details. Officially,
      they say he was born in 1942, but some sources say 1941. Let me check mentally.
      He died in December 2011. If he was born in 1941, he would be 70 years old.
      If 1942, then 69. But let''s go with the official North Korean claim, even though
      it''s disputed. So birth year 1942, death 2011. So 2011 - 1942 = 69 years old.


      Now Chuck Berry. He''s the famous rock and roll musician. When did he die? I
      think he lived a long life. I remember he was still performing in his late 80s.
      He passed away a few years ago. Let me think. I believe Chuck Berry died in
      2017. His birth year was 1926. So 2017 minus 1926 equals 91 years old. Wait,
      that can''t be right. Let me double-check. Chuck Berry was born on October 18,
      1926, and died on March 18, 2017. So that''s 2017 - 1926 = 91 years old. Yeah,
      that''s correct. He was 90 years and 5 months old, so 90 at death. Wait, wait.
      Wait, 2017 minus 1926 is 91, but from October 1926 to March 2017 is actually
      90 years and 5 months. So depending on the exact dates, he was 90 years old
      when he died. Hmm. Wait, 2017 minus 1926: 1926 +91 = 2017. So if his birthday
      was in October and he died in March, he hadn''t turned 91 yet. So he was 90
      years old. So that would make him 90 at death.


      So Kim Jong-il was 69 or 70, depending on the birth year. Chuck Berry was 90.
      So yes, Kim Jong-il was younger at the time of death than Chuck Berry. Wait,
      but need to confirm the exact ages.


      Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake with Chuck Berry''s death age. Let me
      think again. If he was born in 1926 and died in 2017, then 2017 - 1926 = 91.
      But if his birthday is after March, which it is (October), then he was 90 years
      old when he died in March 2017. So 90 years old. So Kim Jong-il died at 69 (if
      1942) or 70 (1941). Either way, he was younger than Chuck Berry, who was 90.
      So the answer should be YES.

      </think>YES. Kim Jong-il was born on February 16, 1941 (officially 1942), and
      died on December 17, 2011, making him either 69 or 70 years old at death. Chuck
      Berry, born October 18, 1926, died on March 18, 2017, at age 90. Regardless
      of Kim''s disputed birth year, he was younger than Berry at their respective
      deaths.'

      \ passed away in 2011. Now, when was he born? I think he was born in 1941 or\
      \ 1942. Let me check that. Wait, historical figures' birth dates are usually\
      \ well-documented. If he died in 2011 and was born in 1941, that would make\
      \ him 70 years old. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact year. Let me confirm.\
      \ Yes, Kim Jong-il was born on February 16, 1941, and died on December 17, 2011.\
      \ So 2011 minus 1941 is 70 years, but since his birthday is in February and\

      \ the famous rock and roll musician, right? I know he lived a long life. I think\
      \ he died in his 90s. Wait, no, maybe late 80s? Let me think. He was a pioneer\
      \ in the 1950s, so if he started in his 20s, he'd be around, say, 30 in 1955.\
      \ Then if he died more recently, maybe 2017? I remember hearing about his death\
      \ around that time. Let me check the dates. Chuck Berry was born on October\
      \ 18, 1926, and died on March 18, 2017. So 2017 minus 1926 is 91 years. But\
      \ he died in March, and his birthday is in October, so he was 90 years old at\

    5fe1243b-dc39-4dd9-9a67-dcdc8720a7e2: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Kim Jong-il was younger at the time of his death than Chuck Berry\

      \ Kim Jong-il. I remember he was the leader of North Korea before his son Kim\
      \ Jong-un took over. I think he died in 2011. Let me confirm that. Yes, Kim\
      \ Jong-il died on December 17, 2011. Now, his birth year... I think he was born\
      \ in 1941 or 1942. Wait, there's some confusion here because some sources say\
      \ he was born in 1941, but North Korean official records state 1942. But I've\
      \ heard that his actual birth year might be 1941, but the government changed\
      \ it to 1942 for political reasons. So maybe I should go with the official North\
      \ Korean date, which is 1942. So if he died in 2011, subtract 1942 from 2011.\
      \ 2011 minus 1942 is 69 years old. Wait, but if he was born in February 1941,\
      \ then in 2011 he would have been 70. But according to the official North Korean\
      \ stance, it's 1942, so 69. I'll note that there's a discrepancy, but perhaps\
      \ the answer relies on the official records. So tentatively, 69 years old at\
      \ death.\n\nNow Chuck Berry. He was a famous American musician, a pioneer of\
      \ rock and roll. When did he die? I think he passed away more recently. Let\
      \ me recall. Chuck Berry died in 2017. His birth year was 1926. So 2017 minus\
      \ 1926 is 91 years old. So he was 90 or 91? Let's check exact dates. Chuck Berry\
      \ was born on October 18, 1926, and died on March 18, 2017. So from October\
      \ 18, 1926, to March 18, 2017. Let's calculate his age. From 1926 to 2016 is\
      \ 90 years. Then from October 18, 2016, to March 18, 2017, is 5 months. So he\
      \ was 90 years and 5 months old when he died. So 90 years old. Wait, but depending\
      \ on the exact calculation, he was 90 years old, turning 91 in October 2017,\
      \ but he died in March, so he was 90. So Chuck Berry was 90 at death.\n\nNow\
      \ comparing the two. Kim Jong-il, if 69, and Chuck Berry at 90. So yes, Kim\
      \ Jong-il was younger at the time of his death than Chuck Berry. But wait, I\
      \ need to make sure about Kim's birth year. If the actual birth year is 1941,\
      \ then 2011-1941=70. So 70 vs 90. Either way, 70 is still younger than 90. So\
      \ regardless of the 1941 or 1942 discrepancy, Kim Jong-il was younger. Therefore,\
      \ the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Kim\
      \ Jong-il's Death Age:**  \n   - Official birth year: 1942 (North Korean records).\

      biography states he was born on February 16, 1941. He died on December 17, 2011.
      So to calculate his age at death: 2011 minus 1941 is 70 years. But wait, since
      his birthday is in February and he died in December, he had already turned 70
      that year. So he was 70 years old when he died.


      Now, Chuck Berry. He was a famous American musician, right? I know he lived
      a long life. Let me think. He was a pioneer of rock and roll, active from the
      1950s onwards. His death was in 2017, I believe. His birth year... I think he
      was born in 1926. So if he died in 2017, subtracting 1926 from 2017 gives 91
      years. Wait, but when was his birthday? Let me confirm. Chuck Berry was born
      on October 18, 1926, and he died on March 18, 2017. So he was 90 years old at
      the time of death. Wait, because from October 18, 1926, to October 18, 2016,
      he would have turned 90. Then from October 18, 2016, to March 18, 2017, that''s
      5 months, so he was 90 years old when he died, not 91 yet. Wait, maybe I made
      a mistake here. Let''s do the math properly. 2017 minus 1926 is 91 years, but
      if he died before his birthday in 2017, he would be 90. His birthday is October
      18, and he died on March 18, which is before October, so he was 90 years old
      at death.


      So Kim Jong-il was 70, Chuck Berry was 90. Therefore, Kim Jong-il was younger
      at the time of his death than Chuck Berry. So the answer should be YES.

      </think>Kim Jong-il was born on February 16, 1941, and died on December 17,
      2011, making him 70 years old at death. Chuck Berry was born on October 18,
      1926, and died on March 18, 2017, which means he was 90 years old at death.
      Since 70 is younger than 90, the answer is YES.


      ANSWER: YES'
    90d91cc9-e43d-4de0-bedf-025d53fc5cfa: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Kim Jong-il was younger when he died compared to Chuck Berry. Let me start\
      \ by recalling their birth and death dates. \n\nFirst, Kim Jong-il. I remember\
      \ he was the leader of North Korea before his son Kim Jong-un took over. I think\
      \ he died a few years ago. Let me check the dates. If I recall correctly, Kim\
      \ Jong-il was born in 1941 or 1942. Wait, there's some confusion because North\
      \ Korean sources say he was born in 1942, but some reports suggest he was actually\
      \ born in 1941 in the Soviet Union. Anyway, his death was in December 2011.\
      \ So if he was born in 1941, he would be 70 years old in 2011. If 1942, then\
      \ 69.\n\nNow Chuck Berry, the musician. He was a rock and roll pioneer. I know\
      \ he lived a long life. His most famous songs are from the 50s and 60s. He died\
      \ more recently. Let me think. I believe Chuck Berry passed away in 2017. His\
      \ birth year was 1926. So if he died in 2017, subtract 1926 from 2017. That's\
      \ 91 years old. \n\nSo, Kim Jong-il died at 69 or 70, and Chuck Berry at 91.\
      \ Therefore, yes, Kim Jong-il was younger at the time of his death than Chuck\
      \ Berry. Wait, but I need to confirm the exact birth years to be sure. Let me\
      \ double-check.\n\nQuick search in my mind: Kim Jong-il's official biography\
      \ says February 16, 1941, but some sources say 1942. Died December 17, 2011.\
      \ So from 1941 to 2011 is 70 years. If he was born in February 1941 and died\
      \ in December 2011, he was 70 years old. Chuck Berry was born October 18, 1926,\
      \ died March 18, 2017. So 2017 - 1926 = 91 years. Even if Kim was born in 1942,\
      \ he would be 69, which is still younger than 91.\n\nSo the answer is YES, Kim\
      \ Jong-il was younger when he died than Chuck Berry.\n</think>Kim Jong-il was\
      \ born in 1941 (officially 1942) and died in 2011 at age 70 (or 69 if 1942).\
      \ Chuck Berry, born in 1926, died in 2017 at age 91. Regardless of Kim's disputed\
      \ birth year, 69\u201370 is younger than 91. \n\n**Answer: YES**"
    cc615e41-614f-41e2-bb47-f5cbbc2f94a2: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The question is whether Kim Jong-il was younger at the time\
      \ of his death than Chuck Berry was when he died. \n\nFirst, I need to find\
      \ out the birth years and death years of both individuals. Let's start with\
      \ Kim Jong-il. From what I remember, Kim Jong-il was the leader of North Korea\
      \ and the father of the current leader, Kim Jong-un. He died in 2011, I think.\
      \ His birth year... I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I recall that there's some controversy\
      \ around his actual birth year because North Korean sources claim he was born\
      \ in 1942, but some reports suggest he might have been born in 1941. But for\
      \ the sake of official records, I'll go with 1942. So if he died in 2011, his\
      \ age at death would be 2011 minus 1942. Let me calculate that: 2011 - 1942\
      \ = 69 years old.\n\nNow, Chuck Berry. He was a famous American musician, often\
      \ called the \"Father of Rock and Roll.\" I know he lived a long life. His death\
      \ was more recent, maybe around 2017? Let me confirm. Yes, Chuck Berry died\
      \ in 2017. His birth year was 1926, I believe. So subtracting 1926 from 2017\
      \ gives 2017 - 1926 = 91 years old. \n\nWait, so Kim Jong-il was 69 when he\
      \ died, and Chuck Berry was 91. That would mean Kim Jong-il was indeed younger\
      \ at the time of his death. Therefore, the answer should be YES. \n\nBut let\
      \ me double-check the dates to be sure. Kim Jong-il's official date of birth\
      \ is February 16, 1942, and he died on December 17, 2011. So even if we consider\
      \ the exact dates, in would have would have been 69 years old (since 2011 -\
      \ 1942 = 69). Chuck Berry was born on October 18, 1926, and died on March 18,\
      \ 2017. Calculating his age: 2017 - 1926 = 91 years. Even considering the exact\
      \ months, since he died in March 2017, he had already had his birthday in October\
      \ 2016, so he was 91 years old. \n\nYes, the calculations hold up. Therefore,\
      \ Kim Jong-il was younger at his time of death compared to Chuck Berry.\n</think>YES.\
      \ Kim Jong-il was born in 1942 and died in 2011 at age 69. Chuck Berry was born\
      \ in 1926 and died in 2017 at age 91. Since 69 is less than 91, Kim Jong-il\
      \ was younger at his time of death. \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    e89977fe-9819-46e0-899f-97a0c5e853d8: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure this\
      \ out. The question is asking whether Kim Jong-il was younger when he died than\
      \ Chuck Berry was when he died. I need to compare their ages at the time of\
      \ their deaths.\n\nFirst, I need to find out when each of them died and their\
      \ birth dates. Let's start with Kim Jong-il. From what I remember, he was the\
      \ leader of North Korea and the father of the current leader, Kim Jong-un. I\
      \ think he died in 2011. Let me check that. Yes, Kim Jong-il died on December\
      \ 17, 2011. His birth date is a bit tricky because there's some conflicting\
      \ information. I recall that his official biography states he was born on February\
      \ 16, 1942, in a secret camp on Mount Paektu, but some sources say he was actually\
      \ born in the Soviet Union in 1941. But since the official North Korean stance\
      \ is 1942, I'll go with that. So if he died in 2011, subtract 1942 from 2011.\
      \ 2011 minus 1942 is 69 years old. Wait, but if he was born in February 1942\
      \ and died in December 2011, he would have been 69 years old at death.\n\nNow,\
      \ Chuck Berry. He was a famous American musician, right? Known as one of the\
      \ pioneers of rock and roll. I think he lived a long life. Let me recall his\
      \ death. Chuck Berry died in 2017, I believe. Yes, he passed away on March 18,\
      \ 2017. His birth date was October 18, 1926. So calculating his age at death:\
      \ 2017 minus 1926 equals 91 years. But since his birthday is in October, and\
      \ he died in March, he hadn't turned 91 yet. Wait, no. October 18, 1926, to\
      \ March 18, 2017. From October 1926 to October 2016 would be 90 years. Then\
      \ from October 2016 to March 2017 is 5 months. So he was 90 years and 5 months\
      \ old when he died. Wait, but 2017 minus 1926 is 91, but since his birthday\
      \ hadn't occurred yet in 2017, he was actually 90 years old at death. Wait,\
      \ let me check that again. If someone is born in 1926 and dies in 2017, subtract\
      \ 1926 from 2017 to get 91. But since his birthday is in October, and he died\
      \ in March, he was still 90 years old because he hadn't reached his 91st birthday.\
      \ So his age at death would be 90 years.\n\nWait, no. The standard way to calculate\

      \ if the death date is before the birthday. So 2017 - 1926 = 91, but since he\
      \ died in March, which is before his October birthday, he was 90 years old.\
      \ So Chuck Berry was 90 years old when he died.\n\nSo Kim Jong-il was 69, and\
      \ Chuck Berry was 90. Therefore, Kim Jong-il was younger when he died. So the\
      \ answer is YES, because 69 is less than 90.\n</think>Kim Jong-il was born on\

    1f247c63-8f8e-4493-9036-b3af88ef3c68: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the question is whether Charles de Gaulle was younger at the time of his\
      \ death than Max Weber. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure out the birth and\
      \ death years of both individuals to calculate their ages at death.\n\nStarting\
      \ with Charles de Gaulle. I remember he was a French president, right? I think\
      \ he was involved in World War II, leading the Free French Forces. Let me recall...\
      \ I believe he was born in 1890. His death, I think, was in 1970. So if that's\
      \ correct, he would have been 80 years old when he died. Wait, 1970 minus 1890\
      \ is 80. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, Max Weber. Wait, the question mentions\
      \ Max Wilhelm Carl Weber. That's the German sociologist, philosopher, and political\
      \ economist. He's a significant figure in social theory. Let me get his dates.\
      \ I think he was born in the mid-19th century. Maybe 1864? And he died relatively\
      \ young, perhaps in 1920. Let me check that. If he was born in 1864 and died\
      \ in 1920, that would make him 56 years old. Wait, 1920 minus 1864 is 56. That\
      \ seems correct. I remember Weber died in his 50s, so that fits.\n\nSo, comparing\
      \ the two: de Gaulle died at 80, Weber at 56. Therefore, de Gaulle was older\
      \ at the time of his death than Weber. The question asks if de Gaulle was younger\
      \ than Weber when they died. Since 80 is more than 56, the answer should be\
      \ NO. But wait, let me double-check the dates to be sure I didn't mix them up.\n\
      \nCharles de Gaulle: November 22, 1890 \u2013 November 9, 1970. So, he was just\
      \ shy of 80, but still 79 or 80 depending on the exact calculation. But generally,\
      \ it's considered 80. Max Weber: April 21, 1864 \u2013 June 14, 1920. So, 1920\
      \ minus 1864 is 56 years. So yes, Weber was 56, de Gaulle 80. Therefore, de\
      \ Gaulle was older. So the answer is NO, he wasn't younger.\n</think>NO  \n\
      Charles de Gaulle was born in 1890 and died in 1970, making him 79\u201380 years\
      \ old at his death. Max Weber was born in 1864 and died in 1920, at age 56.\

      \ Max Weber\u2014the sociologist? I think there are two famous Webers maybe?\
      \ But I'm pretty sure Max Weber the sociologist is the one they mean here. \n\
      \nFirst, I need the birth and death years of both. Let me start with Charles\
      \ de Gaulle. He was a French president, right? So he was around during World\
      \ War II. I think he was born in 1890 and died in 1970. Let me check in my mind.\
      \ Yeah, de Gaulle was born November 22, 1890, and died November 9, 1970. So\
      \ that would make him 79 years old when he died, but wait, his birthday is in\

      \ birthday (which would be on the 22nd), he would be 79 years, 11 months old.\
      \ So his age at death is 79 years.\n\nNow Max Weber. The sociologist Max Weber\
      \ was German. I remember he was born in the 19th century and died relatively\
      \ young. I think he was born in 1864. Let's confirm. Max Weber was born April\

      \ June 14, 1920. So let's calculate his age. From 1864 to 1920 is 56 years.\
      \ But since his birthday is in April, he died in June, so he had already turned\
      \ 56 that year. So his age at death was 56.\n\nTherefore, comparing the two:\

      \ 56 years old at the time of his death.  \nSince 79 (de Gaulle) is greater\
      \ than 56 (Weber), de Gaulle was **older** at death than Weber. The answer is\
      \ **NO**."
    34d6cb7d-3fe0-4a27-af4d-91eaa1b5196c: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure out if\
      \ Charles de Gaulle was younger when he died compared to Max Weber. Hmm, first\
      \ I need to remember their birth and death years. \n\nCharles de Gaulle, the\
      \ French president, right? I think he died in 1970. Let me check... Yeah, he\
      \ was born in 1890 and died in 1970. So subtracting 1890 from 1970, that's 80\
      \ years old.\n\nNow, Max Weber. Wait, there might be a mix-up here. Max Weber\
      \ the sociologist? There's also his brother maybe? But the name given is Max\
      \ Wilhelm Carl Weber. The sociologist's full name is Maximilian Karl Emil Weber,\
      \ I think. He was born in 1864 and died in 1920. Let me confirm. If he was born\
      \ in 1864 and died in 1920, that would make him 56 years old. \n\nSo de Gaulle\
      \ was 80, Weber was 56. Therefore, de Gaulle was older at death. Wait, no, the\
      \ question is if de Gaulle was younger than Weber when they died. So since 80\
      \ is more than 56, the answer is NO. But wait, wait. Wait, maybe there's another\
      \ Max Weber? Because sometimes names can be confusing. For example, there's\
      \ a Max Weber who was a painter, born later. But the full name here is Max Wilhelm\
      \ Carl Weber. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the sociologist Max Weber's full\
      \ name is Maximilian Karl Emil Weber. The name given here is Max Wilhelm Carl\
      \ Weber. The middle names are different. Hmm. Maybe it's a different person?\
      \ Could it be the German-American painter Max Weber (1881\u20131961)? Or maybe\
      \ another figure. Wait, if the painter Max Weber was born in 1881 and died in\
      \ 1961, he would be 80. Wait, same age as de Gaulle? But de Gaulle died in 1970.\
      \ Wait, no, 1961-1881 is 80 years. So if that's the case, then de Gaulle died\
      \ at 80 in 1970, that would be 80. If the Max Weber in question is the painter,\
      \ he died at 80. Then both would be the same age. But the question says Max\
      \ Wilhelm Carl Weber. Wait, maybe it's another person. Maybe a different Max\
      \ Weber. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps the sociologist's full name is different.\
      \ Let me check again. The famous sociologist Max Weber was born in 1864 and\
      \ died in 1920, making him 56. Full name Maximilian Karl Emil Weber, so the\
      \ middle names are Karl Emil, not Wilhelm Carl. So if the question refers to\
      \ someone else, maybe a different Max Weber. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo\
      \ or confusion in the name. But given the name provided, Max Wilhelm Carl Weber,\
      \ perhaps that's a different person. Maybe a military figure? Or another academic?\n\
      \nAlternatively, maybe the user confused the first names. Let me think. If the\
      \ Max Weber in question is indeed the sociologist, then he died at 56, and de\
      \ Gaulle at 80. Therefore, de Gaulle was older. So the answer is NO. But if\
      \ there's another Max Weber who lived longer, like the painter, born 1881, died\
      \ 1961 (80), then same age. But the names don't match. The painter's full name\
      \ is Max Weber, but maybe his full name includes Wilhelm Carl? Let me check.\n\
      \nLooking up Max Weber (artist): He was born in 1881 in Bia\u0142ystok, then\
      \ part of Russia, now Poland. His full name might be different. Some sources\
      \ say his name was Max Weber, but maybe his birth name was different. Alternatively,\
      \ maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the question specifies Max Wilhelm\
      \ Carl Weber. If that person was born, let's say, in a certain year and died\
      \ in a certain year, we need those dates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a mistake,\
      \ and the user meant the sociologist. If that's the case, then the answer is\
      \ NO. But without exact dates for Max Wilhelm Carl Weber, it's hard to say.\
      \ Wait, but maybe there's a historical figure with that exact name. Let me check.\
      \ Searching for Max Wilhelm Carl Weber.\n\nAh, perhaps it's Max Weber, the German\
      \ economist and politician? Wait, no. Another possibility: Max Carl Wilhelm\
      \ Weber (1852\u20131937), a German-Dutch zoologist. Let's see. Born in 1852,\
      \ died in 1937. That would make him 85 years old. If that's the case, then de\
      \ Gaulle died at 80, Weber at 85. Then the answer would be YES, because 80 is\
      \ younger than 85. But is this the correct person?\n\nWait, the name given is\
      \ Max Wilhelm Carl Weber. The zoologist is Max Wilhelm Carl Weber. Yes, his\
      \ full name is Max Wilhelm Carl Weber. He was born on December 5, 1852, in Bonn,\
      \ Germany, and died on February 7, 1937. So his age at death would be 1937 -\
      \ 1852 = 85 years.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was born in 1890, died in 1970. 1970\
      \ - 1890 = 80 years. So de Gaulle was younger at death (80) compared to Weber\
      \ (85). Therefore, the answer would be YES.\n\nWait, this depends on which Max\
      \ Weber we're talking about. The question specifies Max Wilhelm Carl Weber,\
      \ which matches the zoologist. The sociologist is a different person with a\
      \ similar name. So if the question is referring to the zoologist Max Wilhelm\
      \ Carl Weber, then he died at 85, de Gaulle at 80. So de Gaulle was younger.\
      \ Therefore, the answer is YES.\n\nSo the key is correctly identifying which\
      \ Max Weber the question refers to. The full name given is Max Wilhelm Carl\
      \ Weber, which points to the zoologist. Hence, the answer is YES.\n</think>Charles\
      \ de Gaulle was born in 1890 and died in 1970, making him **80 years old** at\
      \ his death. Max Wilhelm Carl Weber, the German-Dutch zoologist, was born in\
      \ 1852 and died in 1937, living **85 years**. Since 80 is younger than 85, the\

      \ both individuals. Charles de Gaulle was a French statesman and general, right?\
      \ He was the leader of Free France during WWII and later President. He died\
      \ in 1970, I believe. As for Max Weber, the sociologist, he was German and died\
      \ much earlier, maybe in the 1920s? Let me get exact dates.\n\nCharles de Gaulle\
      \ was born on November 22, 1890, and died on November 9, 1970. That would make\
      \ him 79 years old at death, just shy of his 80th birthday. \n\nNow, Max Weber.\
      \ Wait, the question says Max Wilhelm Carl Weber. Let me verify. The famous\
      \ sociologist is Max Weber, full name Maximilian Karl Emil Weber, born April\
      \ 21, 1864, died June 14, 1920. So he was 56 when he died. But the question\
      \ mentions \"Max Wilhelm Carl Weber\"\u2014maybe that's a different person?\
      \ Wait, perhaps it's a mix-up with another Weber. Let me check if there's another\
      \ Max Weber with that name.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo. The middle\
      \ names might be confused. Let me double-check. The sociologist's full name\
      \ is Maximilian Karl Emil Weber. So the middle names are Karl Emil. The question's\
      \ version is Max Wilhelm Carl Weber. Wilhelm and Carl are different middle names.\
      \ So perhaps this is a different person. Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the user\
      \ made a mistake in the name, but I have to go with the name given.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe it's referring to Max Weber the painter, but I don't think so. Let me\
      \ look up Max Wilhelm Carl Weber. A quick search: Max Wilhelm Carl Weber (1852\u2013\
      1937) was a German-Dutch zoologist and biogeographer. Oh, okay, so that's a\
      \ different person. So the question is comparing Charles de Gaulle (1890-1970)\
      \ to Max Wilhelm Carl Weber (1852-1937). So their death years are 1970 and 1937,\
      \ respectively.\n\nWait, but the question is about who was younger at their\
      \ time of death. So we need to calculate their ages at death and compare.\n\n\
      First, Charles de Gaulle: born 1890, died 1970. 1970 minus 1890 is 80 years,\
      \ but he died in November 1970, and was born in November 1890. His exact death\
      \ date is November 9, 1970, and his birth date is November 22, 1890. So he was\
      \ 79 years and 352 days old, which is just 13 days short of 80. So approximately\
      \ 79 years old.\n\nMax Wilhelm Carl Weber: born 1852, died 1937. Let's get exact\
      \ dates. According to some sources, he was born on December 5, 1852, and died\
      \ on February 7, 1937. So let's calculate his age at death. 1937 minus 1852\
      \ is 85 years. But from December 5, 1852, to February 7, 1937: he would have\
      \ been 84 years and 64 days old. Wait, let's do the exact calculation. From\
      \ December 5, 1852, to December 5, 1936, that's 84 years. Then from December\
      \ 5, 1936, to February 7, 1937: December has 31 days, so 31 - 5 = 26 days in\
      \ December, plus 31 days in January, plus 7 days in February: 26 +31+7=64 days.\
      \ So 84 years and 64 days, which is 84 years and about 2 months. So he was 84\
      \ when he died.\n\nWait, but 1937 minus 1852 is 85 years, but since his birthday\
      \ is in December, and he died in February, he hadn't reached his 85th birthday\
      \ yet. So he was 84 years old at death.\n\nSo Charles de Gaulle died at 79,\
      \ Max Weber (the zoologist) at 84. Therefore, de Gaulle was younger at his death\
      \ than Weber. So the answer is YES.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014the question is phrased\
      \ as \"Was Charles de Gaulle younger at their time of death than Max Wilhelm\
      \ Carl Weber at their time of death?\" So yes, 79 vs. 84, so YES.\n\nBut wait,\
      \ I need to make sure I have the right Max Weber. The key is that the question\
      \ specifies \"Max Wilhelm Carl Weber,\" which is the zoologist, not the sociologist.\
      \ The sociologist Max Weber died in 1920 at 56, which would make de Gaulle older\
      \ (79) than him. But the question is about the zoologist, so the answer is YES.\
      \ But if the user confused the names and meant the sociologist, then the answer\
      \ would be NO. But since the name given is Max Wilhelm Carl Weber, we have to\
      \ go with that.\n\nSo the answer is YES, because de Gaulle was 79, and the zoologist\
      \ Weber was 84.\n</think>Charles de Gaulle was born on November 22, 1890, and\
      \ died on November 9, 1970, making him 79 years old at his death. Max Wilhelm\
      \ Carl Weber, the German-Dutch zoologist, was born on December 5, 1852, and\
      \ died on February 7, 1937, at the age of 84. Since 79 is younger than 84, **YES**,\
      \ Charles de Gaulle was younger at his time of death than Max Wilhelm Carl Weber.\
      \ \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    50421b36-1e63-4afb-8934-e792d09b48b0: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ The question is whether Charles de Gaulle was younger at the time of his death\

      \ Gaulle. I remember he was a French president, right? He led France during\
      \ World War II and later was president in the Fifth Republic. I think he died\
      \ in 1970. His birth year... I'm pretty sure he was born in 1890. Let me check\
      \ mentally. Yeah, Charles de Gaulle was born on November 22, 1890, and died\
      \ on November 9, 1970. Wait, November 22 to November 9\u2014so just a few days\
      \ before his 80th birthday. So he was 79 years old when he died.\n\nNow, Max\
      \ Weber. The full name is Max Wilhelm Carl Weber. He's the German sociologist,\
      \ philosopher, and political economist, right? Not the politician, but the scholar.\
      \ His dates... I might be mixing him up with others. Let's see. Weber is a significant\
      \ figure in sociology; he wrote \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.\"\
      \ I think he died relatively young. If I recall, he was born in 1864. And he\
      \ died in 1920. Let me verify that. Yes, born April 21, 1864, died June 14,\
      \ 1920. So that would make him 56 years old at the time of his death.\n\nWait\
      \ a second. So de Gaulle died at 79, Weber at 56. The question is whether de\
      \ Gaulle was younger when he died than Weber. But 79 is older than 56. So the\
      \ answer would be NO, because de Gaulle was older at his death than Weber was.\
      \ Therefore, he wasn't younger. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the years\
      \ to be sure. For de Gaulle: 1970 minus 1890 is 80 years, but since he died\
      \ in November and was born in November, but he died on the 9th and was born\
      \ on the 22nd, so he was 79 years and 352 days old. Still, effectively 79 years.\
      \ Weber: 1920 minus 1864 is 56 years. So yes, 56 years old. So de Gaulle was\
      \ 79, Weber 56. Therefore, de Gaulle was older. So the answer is NO.\n</think>NO.\
      \ Charles de Gaulle was born on November 22, 1890, and died on November 9, 1970,\
      \ making him 79 years old at his death. Max Weber, born April 21, 1864, died\
      \ June 14, 1920, at age 56. Since 79 > 56, de Gaulle was older at his death.\
      \ \n\n**Answer:** NO"
    900ee106-812a-4e97-ace1-e29eed5d4f5e: "<think>Alright, let's see. I need to figure\
      \ out if Charles de Gaulle was younger when he died compared to Max Weber. Wait,\
      \ first, I should probably confirm who these people are and their birth and\
      \ death dates.\n\nSo, Charles de Gaulle\u2014he was a French leader, right?\
      \ I think he was the president of France, maybe during or after World War II.\
      \ I recall he died in 1970. Let me check the dates... Yeah, Charles de Gaulle\
      \ was born on November 22, 1890, and died on November 9, 1970. So, to calculate\
      \ his age at death: 1970 minus 1890 is 80 years, but since his birthday is in\
      \ November and he died in November, subtracting the days: November 9 is before\
      \ November 22, so he was 79 years old when he died. Wait, 1970 minus 1890 is\
      \ 80, but since he hadn't reached his birthday yet in 1970, he would be 79.\
      \ Hmm, maybe? Let me check again. If he was born in 1890 and died in 1970, that's\
      \ 80 years, but if his death date is before his birthday in that final year,\
      \ then he's 79. So November 9, 1970 is 13 days before his 80th birthday. So\
      \ yes, he was 79 when he died.\n\nNow Max Weber\u2014the sociologist, right?\
      \ Max Weber, the German sociologist. There's also a politician with a similar\
      \ name, but I think the more famous one is the sociologist. His full name is\
      \ Maximilian Karl Emil Weber, but the question says Max Wilhelm Carl Weber.\
      \ Wait, maybe it's the same person? Sometimes names get translated or written\
      \ differently. Let me confirm. The famous sociologist was born in 1864 and died\
      \ in 1920. Let me check: Max Weber (sociologist) was born April 21, 1864, died\
      \ June 14, 1920. So his age at death would be 1920 minus 1864, which is 56 years.\
      \ But again, checking the months: he died in June, his birthday was in April.\
      \ So from April 21, 1864, to April 21, 1920, would be 56 years. He died on June\
      \ 14, 1920, so he was 56 years and about 2 months old. So 56 years old.\n\n\
      Comparing the two: Charles de Gaulle died at 79, Max Weber at 56. So the question\
      \ is whether de Gaulle was younger at his time of death than Weber. Since 79\
      \ is older than 56, the answer would be NO. Wait, but wait\u2014the question\
      \ wording is tricky. It's asking if de Gaulle was younger than Weber when they\

      \ Max Weber (the sociologist, born April 21, 1864, died June 14, 1920) was **56\

      \ of his death than Weber. \n\n**Answer: NO**"
    9d5c289c-189d-46cd-bc79-e759882b7bed: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ The user wants to know if Charles de Gaulle was younger when he died compared\

      \ with Charles de Gaulle. I recall he was a French president and a key figure\
      \ in World War II. From memory, he was born in 1890 and died in 1970. Let me\
      \ verify that. Yes, Charles de Gaulle was born on November 22, 1890, and passed\
      \ away on November 9, 1970. Calculating his age at death: he was 79 years old,\
      \ but wait, since he died in November 1970 and was born in November 1890, that\

      \ Wait, the name is a bit longer. I need to make sure this is the correct person.\
      \ There's Max Weber, the sociologist, but his full name is Maximilian Karl Emil\
      \ Weber. So maybe there's confusion here. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe\
      \ it's another Weber. Wait, the user wrote Max Wilhelm Carl Weber. Let me check\
      \ if that's a different person. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo. The famous\
      \ Weber in history is Max Weber, the sociologist, born in 1864 and died in 1920.\
      \ His full name was Maximilian Karl Emil Weber. So maybe the question has a\
      \ typo with the middle names. Alternatively, there might be another Weber. Let\
      \ me confirm.\n\nWait, another possibility: Carl Maria von Weber, but he was\
      \ a composer from the early 19th century. But his full name is Carl Maria Friedrich\
      \ Ernst von Weber, so that's different. Max Weber the sociologist's dates: born\
      \ April 21, 1864, died June 14, 1920. Let me confirm that. So if he died in\
      \ 1920, that's age 56. Because 1920 minus 1864 is 56 years. So he was 56 when\
      \ he died.\n\nTherefore, if the question is referring to Max Weber the sociologist\
      \ (possibly with a mix-up in the middle names), then Charles de Gaulle was 79\
      \ or almost 80, and Max Weber was 56. Therefore, de Gaulle was older at death\
      \ than Weber. So the answer would be NO, because the question asks if de Gaulle\
      \ was younger than Weber at their time of death. Since 79 is greater than 56,\
      \ the answer is NO.\n\nWait, but the user wrote \"Max Wilhelm Carl Weber\".\
      \ Let me check if there's another person with that exact name. Maybe a different\
      \ Weber. Let me search. Hmm, there's a Max Weber who was a painter, born in\
      \ 1881, died in 1961. Wait, if that's the case, then his age at death would\
      \ be 80. But that conflicts with the earlier thought. Wait, let me check again.\n\
      \nWait, Max Weber the painter: born April 18, 1881, in Bia\u0142ystok, died\
      \ October 4, 1961, in Great Neck, New York. So 1961-1881=80 years. So he would\
      \ have been 80. So if the question refers to this Max Weber, then de Gaulle\
      \ died at 79 (almost 80), Weber died at 80. So de Gaulle was younger. Then the\
      \ answer would be YES. But the problem is that the user's question specifies\
      \ \"Max Wilhelm Carl Weber\". Let me check the painter's full name. Max Weber\
      \ (painter) \u2013 his full name: Max Weber (April 18, 1881 \u2013 October 4,\
      \ 1961) was a Jewish-American painter and one of the first American Cubist painters.\
      \ His full name might be different. Let me check if his middle names are Wilhelm\
      \ Carl. Difficult to find; some sources might list his full name as Max Weber,\
      \ but maybe including Wilhelm Carl. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake\
      \ in the middle names. Given that the more famous Max Weber is the sociologist,\
      \ but his full name is Maximilian Karl Emil Weber. So perhaps Wilhelm is a confusion\
      \ here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a German politician or military figure\
      \ with that exact name. For instance, looking up Max Weber (politician). There's\
      \ Max Weber (1897\u20131974), a Swiss politician. But that might not fit. Alternatively,\
      \ Max Weber (soldier). Wait, there's a Max Weber (general) who lived from 1824\
      \ to 1901. Let me check. Max Weber (August 27, 1824 \u2013 June 15, 1901) was\
      \ a German military officer who served in the Union Army during the American\
      \ Civil War. His full name might be Maximilian or similar. But if his middle\
      \ names are Wilhelm Carl, then his age at death would be 76 (1901-1824=77? Wait\
      \ 1824 to 1901: 77 years. So 76 years old when he died. So if that's the case,\
      \ de Gaulle died at 79, Weber at 76, then de Gaulle was older, so answer is\
      \ NO.\n\nBut the problem is the exact name given: Max Wilhelm Carl Weber. If\
      \ that's the correct full name, then perhaps the sociologist's name might have\
      \ Wilhelm as a middle name. Let me double-check Max Weber (sociologist). His\
      \ full name is Maximilian Karl Emil Weber. So Karl is the middle name. So the\
      \ user wrote Wilhelm instead of Karl. Perhaps a confusion between similar German\
      \ names. So if we take the sociologist, then he died at 56. If that's the case,\
      \ de Gaulle was older. NO. If the question refers to another Weber with Wilhelm\
      \ in his name, perhaps the answer changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user\
      \ intended Max Weber (sociologist) but got his middle names wrong. Since confusion\
      \ between Karl and Wilhelm is possible. If that's the case, then answer is NO.\
      \ But if the user refers to another Weber with the exact name Max Wilhelm Carl,\
      \ perhaps the answer is different. However, without more information, I might\
      \ have to assume that the intended person is the sociologist Max Weber, considering\
      \ his prominence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to Carl Maria\
      \ von Weber, but that's a composer born in 1786, died in 1826. So he died at\
      \ 39. Then de Gaulle would be older. But that's a different person and the name\
      \ doesn't match.\n\nGiven that the user wrote \"Max Wilhelm Carl Weber\", but\
      \ the most prominent Max Weber (sociologist) has a different set of middle names,\
      \ but maybe in some sources he's referred to with Wilhelm. Alternatively, maybe\
      \ the user made a mistake. Given that, I think the answer hinges on correctly\
      \ identifying which Weber is being referred to. If it's the sociologist (d.\
      \ 1920, age 56), then Charles de Gaulle (d. 1970, age 79) was older, so answer\
      \ is NO. If it's the painter (d. 1961, age 80), then de Gaulle died at 79, so\
      \ YES. But the painter's full name might not include Wilhelm Carl.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ perhaps there's a mistake in the middle names. Given that, the most probable\
      \ scenario is that the question intended Max Weber the sociologist, despite\
      \ the middle name discrepancy. Therefore, the answer is NO.\n\nBut the exact\
      \ answer depends on correctly identifying the person. Since the user provided\
      \ the full name as Max Wilhelm Carl Weber, which doesn't exactly match the sociologist's\
      \ name, but perhaps it's a mistake, and they meant the sociologist. Therefore,\
      \ proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo Charles de Gaulle's age at death: 79 (Nov\
      \ 1890 \u2013 Nov 1970, but died a few days before his 80th birthday).\n\nMax\
      \ Weber (sociologist): born 1864, died 1920: aged 56.\n\nThus, de Gaulle was\

    ae56b882-62ec-40e7-a5bb-91a80b11aeb9: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure this out.\
      \ The question is whether Charles de Gaulle was younger when he died compared\
      \ to Max Weber.\n\nFirst, I need to know the birth and death years of both individuals.\
      \ Let me start with Charles de Gaulle. From what I remember, he was a French\
      \ president, right? I think he was involved in World War II as the leader of\
      \ the Free French Forces. So his lifespan... I believe he was born in 1890.\
      \ Wait, no, maybe 1890? Let me confirm. Yes, Charles de Gaulle was born on November\
      \ 22, 1890, and died on November 9, 1970. That would make him 79 years old when\
      \ he died because 1970 minus 1890 is 80, but since his birthday is in November\
      \ and he died in November, he was just a few days short of 80. So approximately\
      \ 79 years old at death.\n\nNow, Max Weber. Wait, the question says Max Wilhelm\
      \ Carl Weber. That's the German sociologist, right? The one known for his works\
      \ on bureaucracy and Protestant ethic. Let me check his dates. Max Weber was\
      \ born in 1864. Let me verify that. Yes, born April 21, 1864. When did he die?\
      \ I think he died relatively young. Maybe around 1920? Wait, 1920 or a bit later.\
      \ Let me think. I recall he died in 1920. So if he was born in 1864 and died\
      \ in 1920, that would make him 56 years old. Because 1920 minus 1864 is 56.\
      \ So he died at age 56.\n\nSo now comparing the two: Charles de Gaulle was 79,\
      \ Max Weber was 56. Therefore, de Gaulle was older at the time of his death\
      \ than Weber. Therefore, the answer should be NO, because the question is asking\

      \ 56, the answer is NO.\n</think>NO.  \n**Reasoning Steps:**  \n1. **Charles\

      \ death, he was 79 years old (1970 - 1890 = 80, adjusted to 79 due to his November\
      \ birthday).  \n2. **Max Weber** was born on April 21, 1864, and died on June\
      \ 14, 1920. At death, he was 56 years old (1920 - 1864 = 56).  \n3. Comparing\
      \ their ages: **79 (de Gaulle)** > **56 (Weber)**.  \n**Answer:** No, de Gaulle\

      \ right? He died in 1970, I think. His birth year was 1890. So if he died in\
      \ 1970, subtracting 1890 from 1970 gives 80 years old. Wait, wait. Let me confirm.\
      \ Charles de Gaulle was born on November 22, 1890, and died on November 9, 1970.\
      \ So just before his 80th birthday. So his age at death was 79 years, almost\
      \ 80.\n\nNow, Max Weber. Wait, there are a couple of Max Webers. The sociologist\
      \ Max Weber is the famous one. He was German, right? Let me check his dates.\
      \ Max Weber was born in 1864. When did he die? I think he died in 1920. So if\

      \ Wait, let's be precise. His exact birth date is April 21, 1864, and death\
      \ on June 14, 1920. So that's 56 years and a couple of months. So he was 56\
      \ when he died.\n\nSo comparing the two: de Gaulle was 79, Weber was 56. The\
      \ question is whether de Gaulle was younger at death than Weber. But 79 is older\
      \ than 56. Wait, no\u2014the question is phrased as \"Was de Gaulle younger\

      \ Let me double-check. Max Weber, the sociologist, died in 1920. Yes, that's\
      \ correct. Born 1864, died 1920. So 56. And de Gaulle died at 79. So de Gaulle\

      \ The question is whether William Shakespeare was younger when he died compared\

      \ years of both. Let me start with Shakespeare. I remember that William Shakespeare,\
      \ the famous English playwright, was born in 1564 and died in 1616. Let me confirm\
      \ that... Yeah, I think that's right. So if he was born in 1564 and died in\
      \ 1616, his age at death would be 1616 minus 1564. Let's do the math: 1616 -\
      \ 1564 = 52. So Shakespeare died at 52 years old.\n\nNow, Akira Kurosawa. He's\

      \ death dates just to be sure. For Shakespeare, April 23, 1564, to April 23,\
      \ 1616. So exactly 52 years. Kurosawa was born March 23, 1910, and died September\
      \ 6, 1998. So from 1910 to 1998 is 88 years. Even if we account for the exact\

      whether William Shakespeare was younger at the time of his death than Akira

      first.


      Shakespeare, I think he was born in 1564, right? Because I remember he died
      in 1616, and they often say he was 52 when he died. Let me confirm that. If
      he was born in April 1564 and died in April 1616, that would make him exactly
      52 years old. Yeah, that sounds right.


      Now, Akira Kurosawa. He''s a Japanese filmmaker, right? I''m not as sure about
      his dates. I think he was born in the early 20th century. Maybe around 1910?
      And he died in the late 90s? Wait, I think he died in 1998. Let me check that.
      If he was born in 1910 and died in 1998, that would make him 88 years old. But
      wait, maybe his exact birth year is different. Let me think. Oh, right! Kurosawa
      was born on March 23, 1910, and died on September 6, 1998. So subtracting 1910
      from 1998 gives 88 years. But since his birthday is in March and he died in
      September, he was 88 years and about 5 months old. So he was 88 when he died.


      Shakespeare was 52, Kurosawa was 88. So the question is, was Shakespeare younger
      at death than Kurosawa? Yes, 52 is younger than 88. So the answer should be
      YES.

      </think>YES. William Shakespeare was born in 1564 and died in 1616 at age 52.

      \ old when he died. Wait, 1616 minus 1564 is 52. That seems right.\n\nNow, Akira\
      \ Kurosawa. He's a Japanese filmmaker, right? More modern. I'm not exactly sure\
      \ about his dates. Let me think. He directed movies like Seven Samurai and Rashomon.\
      \ I believe he was born in 1910. And he died in the late 90s or early 2000s.\

      \ 1910 is 88. Yeah, that adds up.\n\nSo Shakespeare died at 52, Kurosawa at\
      \ 88. So the question is, was Shakespeare younger when he died than Kurosawa\
      \ when he died. Comparing 52 and 88, yes, 52 is younger. So the answer should\

      \ From what I remember, Shakespeare was born in 1564 and died in 1616. So if\
      \ I subtract his birth year from his death year, that would be 1616 minus 1564.\
      \ Let me calculate that: 1616 - 1564 = 52. So Shakespeare died at age 52.\n\n\
      Now, Akira Kurosawa. He's a Japanese filmmaker, right? I think he lived in the\

      \ 88 years old when he died.\n\nComparing the two: Shakespeare was 52, Kurosawa\
      \ was 88. So yes, Shakespeare was younger at the time of his death than Kurosawa.\
      \ Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check the\
      \ dates to be sure. Sometimes dates can be tricky. For Shakespeare: birth 1564,\
      \ death 1616. 1616 - 1564 is indeed 52. Kurosawa: born 1910, died 1998. 1998\

    19084e3f-0762-424f-b3bd-1c13c1c79080: '<think>Okay, let''s tackle this question
      step by step. So, the question is: Was Vladimir Lenin younger at his time of
      death than John Steinbeck at his time of death? Alright, first, I need to figure
      out the ages of both men when they died. Then compare those two numbers to see
      if Lenin was younger.


      Starting with Vladimir Lenin. I know he was a Russian revolutionary and the
      first leader of the Soviet Union. From what I recall, he died in 1924. Now,
      when was he born? I think he was born in 1870. Let me confirm that. Yes, Lenin
      was born on April 22, 1870. If he died in 1924, then subtracting 1870 from 1924
      gives his age. So 1924 minus 1870. Let''s calculate that: 1924 - 1870 = 54.
      So Lenin died at age 54.


      Now, John Steinbeck. He''s an American author, known for books like "The Grapes
      of Wrath" and "Of Mice and Men." When did he die? I believe he passed away in
      the late 1960s. Let me think. Steinbeck died in 1968. His birth year was 1902.
      So, 1968 minus 1902. Let''s do the math: 1968 - 1902 = 66. So Steinbeck was
      66 when he died.


      Comparing the two ages: Lenin was 54, Steinbeck was 66. So yes, Lenin was younger
      at the time of his death than Steinbeck was when he died. Therefore, the answer
      should be YES.

      </think>Vladimir Lenin was born in 1870 and died in 1924, making him 54 years
      old at his death. John Steinbeck was born in 1902 and died in 1968, living to
      age 66. Since 54 is less than 66, **YES**, Lenin was younger at his time of
      death than Steinbeck.'
    353b74ca-ebd3-47a6-bcac-f7c3f37aa7b7: '<think>Alright, let''s tackle this question.
      So, the question is whether Vladimir Lenin was younger at the time of his death
      than John Steinbeck was when he died. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure out
      the birth and death years of both individuals and then calculate their ages
      at death to compare.


      Starting with Vladimir Lenin. I remember he was a key figure in the Russian
      Revolution. Let me recall his dates. I think he was born in 1870. His death...
      wasn''t it in the 1920s? Maybe 1924? So if he was born in 1870 and died in 1924,
      that would make him 54 years old. Wait, 1924 minus 1870 is 54. Yeah, that seems
      right. Lenin died at 54.


      Now, John Steinbeck. He''s an American author, wrote books like "The Grapes
      of Wrath" and "Of Mice and Men." I''m less sure about his dates. Let me think.
      He was active in the mid-20th century. I believe he was born around 1902. His
      death... maybe in the late 1960s? I think he died in 1968. If he was born in
      1902 and died in 1968, that would make him 66 years old. Let me check the math:
      1968 minus 1902 is 66. Okay, so Steinbeck died at 66.


      Comparing the two: Lenin was 54, Steinbeck was 66. So yes, Lenin was younger
      when he died than Steinbeck. Therefore, the answer should be YES.

      </think>Vladimir Lenin was born in 1870 and died in 1924, making him **54**
      years old at his death. John Steinbeck was born in 1902 and died in 1968, making
      him **66** years old at his death. Since 54 is younger than 66, the answer is:

    4a65b841-3d18-4a5b-817e-20c28dcecec1: '<think>Okay, let''s see. The question is
      whether Vladimir Lenin was younger at the time of his death than John Steinbeck
      was when he died. Hmm, I need to figure out their birth years and death years,
      then calculate their ages at death and compare them.


      First, I should recall when Lenin died. I think Lenin was a key figure in the
      Russian Revolution, so he was around in the early 20th century. I remember he
      died in the 1920s, maybe 1924? And he was born in 1870, if I''m not mistaken.
      Let me check that. Yes, Vladimir Lenin was born on April 22, 1870, and died
      on January 21, 1924. So to calculate his age at death: 1924 minus 1870. That
      would be 54 years old, but wait, he died in January 1924, so he hadn''t had
      his birthday yet that year. So from April 22, 1870, to January 21, 1924, that''s
      53 years and about 9 months. So he was 53 years old when he died, right? Because
      he hadn''t turned 54 yet. Wait, but sometimes when people calculate age, they
      just subtract the years. Hmm, maybe the exact age is 53 years and 8 months or
      something. But for the purpose of this question, maybe the exact day isn''t
      necessary. Let me confirm. If he was born in 1870 and died in 1924, subtracting
      1870 from 1924 gives 54, but since he died before his birthday in 1924, he was
      53. So his age at death was 53.


      Now, John Steinbeck. He''s an American author, wrote "The Grapes of Wrath,"
      "Of Mice and Men," etc. I think he died in the 1960s. Let me think. He was born
      in 1902, I believe. Died in 1968. Let me check. Yes, John Steinbeck was born
      on February 27, 1902, and died on December 20, 1968. So his age at death would
      be 1968 minus 1902, which is 66. But again, considering the exact dates. He
      was born in February and died in December, so he had his birthday in 1968. So
      66 years old. So 66 years old at death.


      So comparing the two: Lenin was 53, Steinbeck was 66. So yes, Lenin was younger
      at the time of his death than Steinbeck. Therefore, the answer is YES.

      </think>Vladimir Lenin was born in 1870 and died in 1924 at the age of 53. John
      Steinbeck was born in 1902 and died in 1968 at the age of 66. Since 53 is younger
      than 66, the answer is YES.


      **Answer:** YES'

      \ I know he was a Russian revolutionary and the first head of the Soviet Union.\
      \ From memory, I think he was born in 1870 and died in the 1920s. Wait, wasn't\
      \ the Russian Revolution in 1917? So he was leading around then. I believe he\
      \ died in 1924. Let me confirm that. Yes, Lenin was born on April 22, 1870,\
      \ and died on January 21, 1924. So to find his age at death, subtract 1870 from\
      \ 1924. That would be 54 years old, right? Wait, because from 1870 to 1924 is\
      \ 54 years, but since he died in January 1924, and was born in April 1870, he\
      \ was actually 53 years old, maybe? Let me check. If someone is born in April\
      \ 1870 and dies in January 1924, they haven't reached their birthday in 1924\
      \ yet, so 1924 minus 1870 is 54, but subtract one year because the birthday\
      \ hadn't occurred yet. Wait, no. Wait, from April 22, 1870, to April 22, 1924,\
      \ would be exactly 54 years. But he died on January 21, 1924, which is three\
      \ months before his 54th birthday. So he was 53 years and about 9 months old.\
      \ So his age at death is 53 years.\n\nNow, John Steinbeck. He's an American\

      \ death: 1968 minus 1902 is 66 years. But since his birthday was in February,\
      \ and he died in December, he had already turned 66 that year. So 66 years old\

      \ the answer should be YES. But wait, I need to ensure that I didn't mix up\
      \ their birth and death dates. Let me check again quickly. Lenin died in 1924\

      \ was when he died. Hmm, I need to figure out their birth years and death years,\
      \ then calculate their ages at death and compare them.\n\nFirst, I should recall\
      \ when Lenin died. I think Lenin was a key figure in the Russian Revolution,\
      \ so he was around in the early 20th century. I remember he died in 1924. His\
      \ birth year... wasn't he born in 1870? So if he died in 1924, subtracting 1870\
      \ from 1924 gives 54 years old. Wait, let me check that math. 1924 minus 1870:\
      \ 1870 + 54 = 1924. Yes, that's right. So Lenin was 54 when he died.\n\nNow,\
      \ John Steinbeck. He's an American author, wrote books like \"The Grapes of\

      \ at his death. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    ae838790-bba0-420f-8c1c-dd2fae68d001: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure out if\
      \ Vladimir Lenin was younger when he died compared to John Steinbeck. Hmm, I\
      \ need to check their birth and death dates first. \n\nSo, Vladimir Lenin was\
      \ a Russian revolutionary. I remember he died in 1924. When was he born? I think\
      \ he was born in 1870. So if he died in 1924, that would make him 54 years old.\
      \ Wait, 1924 minus 1870 is 54. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, John Steinbeck,\
      \ the American author. He wrote books like \"The Grapes of Wrath.\" I'm not\
      \ exactly sure about his dates. Let me recall. I think he was born in the early\
      \ 20th century. Maybe 1902? And he died in 1968. If that's correct, then his\
      \ age at death would be 1968 minus 1902, which is 66. So 66 years old.\n\nComparing\
      \ the two: Lenin was 54, Steinbeck was 66. So yes, Lenin was younger when he\
      \ died than Steinbeck. \n\nWait, but wait a second\u2014maybe I got their birth\
      \ years wrong. Let me double-check. For Lenin: born April 22, 1870, died January\
      \ 21, 1924. So 1924 minus 1870 is indeed 54. But wait, the exact age would depend\
      \ on the months. He was born in April and died in January, so he hadn't had\
      \ his birthday yet in 1924. So from April 1870 to April 1923 is 53 years, and\
      \ then until January 1924 is an additional 9 months. So he was 53 years and\
      \ 9 months old, which is 53.75 years. But usually, when we talk about age at\
      \ death, we count the completed years. So he would still be considered 53 or\
      \ 54? Maybe 53, since he didn't reach his 54th birthday. Wait, but 1924 minus\
      \ 1870 is 54, but he died before his birthday. So he was actually 53 years old.\
      \ Hmm, that's a point I might have missed.\n\nSimilarly, John Steinbeck: born\
      \ February 27, 1902, died December 20, 1968. So from 1902 to 1968 is 66 years.\
      \ Since he died in December, after his February birthday, so 66 years old exactly.\
      \ So 1968 minus 1902 equals 66. So he was 66 years and around 10 months, but\
      \ since the birthday had passed that year, his age at death is 66.\n\nBut Lenin:\
      \ 1924 minus 1870 is 54, but he died in January, so he was born in April 1870.\
      \ So from April 1870 to January 1924, that's 53 years and 9 months. So his age\
      \ would be 53 years. Therefore, the answer would be yes, Lenin was younger (53)\
      \ than Steinbeck (66). \n\nBut wait, different sources might calculate it differently.\
      \ Sometimes, people subtract the years directly without considering the exact\
      \ months. So if you do 1924 - 1870 = 54, and 1968 - 1902 = 66. So the answer\
      \ is still yes. Because even if it's 54 vs 66, 54 is younger. But the exact\
      \ calculation with the months makes it 53 vs 66. Either way, Lenin was younger.\
      \ So the answer is YES.\n</think>Vladimir Lenin was born on April 22, 1870,\
      \ and died on January 21, 1924. Calculating his age at death: he was 53 years\
      \ and 9 months old (not yet 54). John Steinbeck was born on February 27, 1902,\
      \ and died on December 20, 1968, making him 66 years old at death. Even accounting\
      \ for exact months, Lenin was younger. \n\nYES."

      First, Vladimir Lenin. I remember he was a key figure in the Russian Revolution.\
      \ I think he was born in 1870. Let me confirm that. Yes, his birth year is 1870.\
      \ When did he die? I think he died in the 1920s. Maybe 1924? Yeah, that's right,\

    1c390af3-1637-4177-9c1c-438e6c75db31: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question:\
      \ Was Bruce Lee younger at their time of death than Leonard Nimoy at their time\
      \ of death? I need to figure out the answer step by step. \n\nFirst, I should\
      \ probably find out when each of them was born and when they died. Then calculate\
      \ their ages at the time of death and compare. \n\nStarting with Bruce Lee.\
      \ From what I remember, Bruce Lee was a martial artist and actor who died relatively\
      \ young. I think he was born in 1940. His death... I recall it was in the 1970s,\
      \ maybe 1973? Let me confirm. Yes, Bruce Lee was born on November 27, 1940,\
      \ and died on July 20, 1973. So to calculate his age at death: 1973 minus 1940\
      \ equals 33 years. Wait, but since his birthday is in November and he died in\
      \ July, he hadn't turned 33 yet in 1973. Wait, 1973 minus 1940 is 33, but since\
      \ he died before his birthday in November, he was actually 32 years old. Wait,\
      \ no, he was born in November 1940. So from November 1940 to November 1973 would\
      \ be 33 years. But he died in July 1973, so that's 32 years and about 7 months.\
      \ So his age at death would be 32 years old, right? Hmm, but sometimes when\
      \ people calculate age, they just subtract the years without considering the\
      \ exact months. So depending on the calculation method, it might be 32 or 33.\
      \ Wait, let's double-check. If you're born in 1940 and die in 1973, even if\
      \ it's before your birthday, the age is calculated as the number of full years\
      \ lived. So if he died before his birthday, he was 32. But in some contexts,\
      \ they might say 33. I need to be precise here. His date of birth is November\
      \ 27, 1940. Date of death is July 20, 1973. So from November 27, 1940, to November\
      \ 27, 1973, that's exactly 33 years. But he died on July 20, 1973, which is\
      \ 4 months and 7 days before his 33rd birthday. So his exact age at death was\
      \ 32 years, 7 months, and 23 days. But in terms of age at death, it's usually\
      \ given as the number of years completed, so 32 years old. However, sometimes\
      \ it's reported as 32 or 33 depending on the source. I think the standard way\
      \ is to count the completed years. So Bruce Lee was 32 when he died.\n\nNow\
      \ Leonard Nimoy. He's known for playing Spock in Star Trek. I believe he lived\
      \ a longer life. Let me recall. He was born in 1931. Died in 2015. Let me check:\
      \ Leonard Nimoy was born on March 26, 1931, and died on February 27, 2015. So\
      \ his age at death would be 2015 minus 1931, which is 84. But again, considering\
      \ the exact dates. From March 26, 1931, to March 26, 2015, would be 84 years.\
      \ But he died on February 27, 2015, which is about a month before his birthday.\
      \ So he was 83 years old at the time of death, right? Because he hadn't reached\
      \ his 84th birthday yet. So 2015 - 1931 is 84, but since he died before March\
      \ 26, he was 83. So his age at death was 83 years.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me\
      \ double-check. If someone is born in 1931, and dies in 2015, the calculation\
      \ is 2015 - 1931 = 84. But the exact age depends on the birth date. His birth\
      \ date is March 26, 1931. Death date: February 27, 2015. So from March 26, 1931,\
      \ to March 26, 2014, he was 83. Then from March 26, 2014, to February 27, 2015,\
      \ he was 84? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, if he turned 83 on March 26,\
      \ 2014. From March 26, 2014, to March 26, 2015, he would be 84. But he died\
      \ on February 27, 2015, which is before his 84th birthday. So his age was 83\
      \ years old. So he was 83 when he died.\n\nSo Bruce Lee was 32 (or 33 depending\
      \ on calculation), Leonard Nimoy was 83 (or 84). Wait, but let's confirm the\
      \ exact years. Bruce Lee died in 1973 at age 32. Leonard Nimoy died in 2015\
      \ at age 83. So 32 versus 83. Therefore, Bruce Lee was younger at the time of\

      \ of their birth years and death years, then calculate their ages at death and\
      \ compare them.\n\nSo, Bruce Lee\u2014I know he died relatively young. I think\
      \ he was in his early 30s. He was a martial artist and actor, famous for movies\
      \ like Enter the Dragon. Let me recall his dates. I believe he was born in 1940.\
      \ His death was in 1973, right? There was this thing about a cerebral edema\
      \ or something. So if he was born in 1940 and died in 1973, that would make\
      \ him 32 or 33 years old. Wait, exact dates matter here. Let me check mentally.\
      \ Bruce Lee's birthday is November 27, 1940, and he died on July 20, 1973. So\
      \ from November 1940 to November 1973 would be 33 years, but since he died in\
      \ July, he hadn't reached his 33rd birthday yet. So subtracting 1940 from 1973\
      \ gives 33, but since his birthday is in November, he was 32 years old when\
      \ he died in July. Wait, no\u2014if you take 1973 minus 1940, that's 33, but\
      \ he died before his birthday. So from November 27, 1940, to November 27, 1973,\
      \ is 33 years, but he died in July 20, 1973. So he was 32 years and about 8\
      \ months old. So his age at death was 32 years old.\n\nNow Leonard Nimoy. He's\
      \ best known as Spock from Star Trek. He lived a longer life, I think. He died\
      \ more recently. I remember his death was in 2015. Let me think. His birth year\
      \ was 1931. So if he died in 2015, that would make him 83 or 84. Wait, let's\
      \ get exact dates. Leonard Nimoy was born March 26, 1931, and died February\
      \ 27, 2015. So from March 26, 1931, to March 26, 2015, would be 84 years. But\
      \ he died in February, which is before his birthday in March. So 2015 minus\
      \ 1931 is 84, but since he died before turning 84, his age at death was 83 years.\n\
      \nWait, let me double-check that. If he was born in 1931, then in 2015, he would\
      \ have been 2015 - 1931 = 84. But since he died in February 27, 2015, and his\
      \ birthday was March 26, he hadn't turned 84 yet. So 84 minus 1 year? No, because\
      \ from March 26, 1931 to March 26, 2015 is exactly 84 years. So up to March\
      \ 26, 2015, he's 84. But he died on February 27, so he was 83 years, 11 months,\
      \ and some days. Therefore, his age at death was 83 years old.\n\nSo Bruce Lee\
      \ was 32 (or 32 and some months) when he died, Leonard Nimoy was 83. So the\
      \ question is, was Bruce Lee younger at death than Nimoy? Yes, 32 is younger\
      \ than 83. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n\nWait, but wait: Bruce Lee died in\
      \ 1973, and Leonard Nimoy died in 2015. But the question isn't about who died\
      \ earlier, but their ages at their respective times of death. So even if Nimoy\
      \ lived longer in terms of calendar years, his age at death was 83. Bruce was\
      \ 32. So 32 < 83, so yes, Bruce was younger at his death than Nimoy was at his.\n\
      </think>Bruce Lee was born on November 27, 1940, and died on July 20, 1973,\
      \ at the age of 32. Leonard Nimoy was born on March 26, 1931, and died on February\
      \ 27, 2015, at the age of 83. Comparing their ages at death, 32 is younger than\
      \ 83. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    3d329bf3-c4b9-4dc3-8bf4-e305a60fe145: '<think>Okay, let me try to figure this
      out. The question is whether Bruce Lee was younger at the time of his death
      than Leonard Nimoy was when he died. So I need to find out both of their ages
      when they passed away and compare them.


      First, I should recall when Bruce Lee died. From what I remember, Bruce Lee
      was a famous martial artist and actor who died quite young. I think he passed
      away in the 1970s, maybe 1973. As for his age, I believe he was in his early
      30s. Let me check mentally... Bruce Lee was born in 1940, right? So if he died
      in 1973, that would make him 32 or 33 years old. Wait, 1973 minus 1940 is 33,
      so he was 33 when he died.


      Now, Leonard Nimoy is known for playing Spock in Star Trek. He lived longer,
      I think. He passed away more recently, perhaps around 2015? Let me see. Leonard
      Nimoy was born in 1931, I think. If he died in 2015, subtracting 1931 from 2015
      gives 84 years old. So that would make him 84 at the time of his death.


      Comparing the two: Bruce Lee was 33, Leonard Nimoy was 84. Therefore, Bruce
      Lee was indeed younger when he died than Leonard Nimoy. So the answer should
      be YES.

      </think>Bruce Lee was born on November 27, 1940, and died on July 20, 1973,
      at age 32 (33 in East Asian age reckoning, but 32 by Western calculation). Leonard
      Nimoy was born on March 26, 1931, and died on February 27, 2015, at age 83.
      Since 32 (Bruce Lee) is younger than 83 (Leonard Nimoy), the answer is **YES**.'

      \ birthday is in November and he died in July, he hadn't turned 33 yet. Wait,\
      \ actually, he was born in 1940, so in 1973, he would have been 32 years old\
      \ until November 27. Since he died in July, he was 32 years old at the time\
      \ of his death. Hmm, but sometimes people might count the years directly. Let\
      \ me double-check. If he was born in 1940, then in 1973, he would be 33 minus\
      \ the months not yet lived. Since he died in July, which is before November,\
      \ he was 32 years and about 7 months old. So his age at death is 32 years old.\n\
      \nNow, moving on to Leonard Nimoy. He's best known for playing Spock in Star\
      \ Trek. I think he lived a longer life. Let me verify his birth and death dates.\
      \ Leonard Nimoy was born on March 26, 1931, and he died on February 27, 2015.\
      \ Calculating his age at death: 2015 - 1931 = 84 years. But again, considering\
      \ the exact dates, he died in February, which is before his birthday in March.\
      \ So he was 83 years old at the time of his death, right? Because he hadn't\
      \ reached his 84th birthday yet. So 2015 minus 1931 is 84, but since he died\
      \ in February, he was 83 years and 11 months, so 83 years old.\n\nWait, let\
      \ me confirm that. If someone is born in March 1931, in February 2015, they\
      \ would have had their 84th birthday in March 2015. Since they died in February,\
      \ they were still 83. So Leonard Nimoy was 83 when he died. \n\nSo Bruce Lee\
      \ was 32, Leonard Nimoy was 83. Therefore, Bruce Lee was indeed younger at the\
      \ time of his death than Leonard Nimoy. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES\
      \  \nBruce Lee was born in 1940 and died in 1973 at age 32. Leonard Nimoy was\

      \ Bruce Lee. I remember he died in the 1970s, maybe 1973? His birth year was\
      \ around 1940. Let me confirm. Bruce Lee was born on November 27, 1940, and\
      \ died on July 20, 1973. So to calculate his age at death: 1973 minus 1940 is\
      \ 33 years old. But wait, his birthday is in November, and he died in July,\
      \ so he hadn't turned 33 yet. Wait, no. He was born in 1940, so from November\
      \ 27, 1940, to November 27, 1973, would be 33 years. But he died in July 1973,\
      \ so that's a few months before his 33rd birthday. So he was 32 years old when\
      \ he died. Wait, but sometimes age is counted differently. Let me check the\
      \ exact calculation. From November 27, 1940, to July 20, 1973: that's 32 years,\
      \ 7 months, and 23 days. So he was 32 years old, right? Because he hadn't reached\
      \ his 33rd birthday yet. So Bruce Lee was 32 at death.\n\nNow Leonard Nimoy.\
      \ He's famous for playing Spock in Star Trek. I think he died more recently,\
      \ like 2015 maybe? His birth year was in the early 1930s. Let me think. Leonard\
      \ Nimoy was born on March 26, 1931, and died on February 27, 2015. So calculating\
      \ his age at death: 2015 minus 1931 is 84 years. But again, his birthday is\

      \ is 84 years. He died on February 27, 2015, which is just shy of his 84th birthday.\
      \ So he was 83 years old when he died. Wait, but some sources might round up?\
      \ Let me confirm. If someone is born in 1931 and dies in 2015, 2015-1931=84,\

      \ birth and death for both of them. Let's start with Bruce Lee. I know he died\
      \ quite young, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact age. He was a martial artist\
      \ and actor, famous for movies like Enter the Dragon. From what I remember,\
      \ he was born in 1940. His death was in the 1970s, maybe 1973? Let me check\
      \ that mentally. Yes, Bruce Lee died in 1973. So if he was born in 1940, subtracting\
      \ 1940 from 1973 gives 33 years old. Wait, but exact dates matter. Let's be\
      \ precise. Bruce Lee was born on November 27, 1940, and died on July 20, 1973.\
      \ So, from November 1940 to November 1973 would be 33 years, but he died in\
      \ July, so he was 32 years old, not having reached his 33rd birthday yet. So\
      \ Bruce Lee was 32 when he died.\n\nNow, Leonard Nimoy. He's best known as Spock\
      \ from Star Trek. He lived a longer life, I think. When did he pass away? I\
      \ recall it was more recent, maybe around 2015. Let me think. Yes, he died in\
      \ 2015. His birth year was 1931, I believe. So if he was born in 1931 and died\
      \ in 2015, that would make him 83 years old. But wait, exact dates again. Leonard\
      \ Nimoy was born on March 26, 1931, and died on February 27, 2015. So from March\
      \ 1931 to March 2015 would be 84 years, but he died in February, so he was 83\
      \ years old at the time of death, just shy of his 84th birthday.\n\nSo comparing\

      \ in 1931, I think. Let me check that. Leonard Nimoy was born on March 26, 1931,\

    abedab4a-58ee-4fd4-a0a6-81df390cfe23: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ The user wants to know if Bruce Lee was younger when he died compared to Leonard\

      \ was younger. \n\nStarting with Bruce Lee. I remember he died in the 1970s,\
      \ right? Let me confirm. Bruce Lee was born on November 27, 1940, and he died\
      \ on July 20, 1973. So to calculate his age at death, subtract 1940 from 1973.\

      \ so he was actually 32 years old. Wait, no. Let me check: November 27, 1940,\
      \ to November 27, 1973, is exactly 33 years. But he died on July 20, 1973, which\

      \ he was 32 years and however many months. Wait, maybe I should calculate it\
      \ precisely.\n\nHow old was Bruce Lee when he died? Born in 1940, died in 1973.\
      \ So 1973 minus 1940 equals 33. But since his birthday is in November, and he\
      \ died in July, he was 32 years old, 7 months, and some days. So technically,\
      \ he was 32 years old at the time of death. Wait, but sometimes when people\

      \ 1940 and dies in 1973 before their birthday, they are 32 years old. So Bruce\
      \ Lee was 32.\n\nNow Leonard Nimoy. He played Spock in Star Trek. I think he\
      \ died more recently. Let me recall. Leonard Nimoy was born on March 26, 1931,\
      \ and died on February 27, 2015. So calculating his age at death: 2015 minus\
      \ 1931 is 84. But his birthday is in March, and he died in February, so he hadn't\
      \ turned 84 yet. So he was 83 years old at the time of death. Because from March\
      \ 26, 1931, to February 27, 2015, that's 83 years and 11 months approximately.\
      \ So his age was 83.\n\nSo comparing the two: Bruce Lee was 32, Leonard Nimoy\

      \ is famous for her diary during the Holocaust. She was a Jewish girl who hid\
      \ from the Nazis but was eventually captured and died in a concentration camp.\
      \ I think she was a teenager when she died. Maybe around 15 or 16? Let me check\
      \ my memory. She was born in 1929, I believe. Her diary entries stop in 1944,\

      \ and died in, say, February or March 1945, she would have been 15 years old.\
      \ Because 1945 minus 1929 is 16, but if her birthday was in June and she died\

      \ 41. Therefore, yes, Anne Frank was younger at the time of her death than Kobe\

      \ 26, 2020: let's calculate. 2020 minus 1978 is 42 years, but since January\

      \ whether Anne Frank was younger at the time of her death than Kobe Bryant was\
      \ when he died. I need to figure out the ages of both and compare them. \n\n\
      First, I should recall when each of them was born and when they died. Anne Frank\
      \ is a well-known historical figure from World War II. I remember she wrote\
      \ a diary while hiding from the Nazis. She died in a concentration camp, I think.\
      \ Her diary was published after her death. As for Kobe Bryant, he was a famous\
      \ basketball player who died more recently.\n\nLet me start with Anne Frank.\
      \ I believe she was born in 1929. Her birthday is June 12, 1929. She died in\
      \ 1945, right? She was in the Bergen-Belsen camp, and her death was due to typhus.\
      \ Now, if she was born in 1929 and died in 1945, that would make her 15 or 16\
      \ years old. Wait, 1945 minus 1929 is 16, but the exact date matters. Anne Frank\
      \ died in March 1945, I think. Her birthday is in June, so if she died in March,\
      \ she hadn't turned 16 yet. So she would be 15 years old at the time of her\
      \ death.\n\nNow Kobe Bryant. He was born on August 23, 1978. He died in a helicopter\
      \ crash on January 26, 2020. Let's calculate his age. From 1978 to 2020 is 42\
      \ years, but since his birthday is in August and he died in January, he was\
      \ 41 years old at the time of death. Because January is before August, so he\
      \ hadn't turned 42 yet. Wait, 2020 minus 1978 is 42, but he died in January,\
      \ so he was 41 years and about 5 months old. So his age was 41.\n\nSo Anne Frank\

      \ the age of 41 (before his 42nd birthday).  \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    3d6be358-67ea-4da3-ae76-71783e48c831: '<think>Okay, let''s see. The question is
      whether Anne Frank was younger at her time of death than Kobe Bryant was at
      his. Hmm. I need to figure out both of their ages when they died and then compare
      them.


      First, Anne Frank. I remember she was a Jewish girl who wrote a diary during
      the Holocaust. She died during World War II, right? I think she was in a concentration
      camp. Let me recall her birth year. I believe she was born in 1929. When did
      she die? I think she died in 1945, maybe around the time the war ended. Wait,
      no, actually, the camps were liberated in 1945, but she might have died a bit
      earlier. Let me check my memory. Oh, right, Anne Frank died in early 1945, in
      February or March, in Bergen-Belsen. So if she was born in June 1929, then by
      early 1945, she would have been 15 years old. Let me calculate: 1945 minus 1929
      is 16, but since her birthday is in June, if she died in February or March,
      she hadn''t turned 16 yet. So she was 15 when she died.


      Now Kobe Bryant. He was a famous basketball player. I know he died in a helicopter
      crash a few years ago. Let me think. He was born in 1978, August 23. His death
      was in January 2020. So how old was he? 2020 minus 1978 is 42. But since his
      birthday is in August, and he died in January, he was 41 years old at the time
      of his death. Wait, 2020 minus 1978 is 42, but since he hadn''t reached his
      birthday in 2020 yet (since he died in January), he was 41. So 41 years old.


      So Anne Frank was 15, Kobe Bryant was 41. Therefore, yes, Anne Frank was younger
      at her death than Kobe Bryant was at his. The answer should be YES.

      </think>Anne Frank was born on June 12, 1929, and died in February or March
      1945 at the age of 15. Kobe Bryant was born on August 23, 1978, and died on
      January 26, 2020, at the age of 41. Since 15 is younger than 41, the answer
      is YES.


      **ANSWER: YES**'
    3fb38a8f-98bf-4e38-bf04-d39b65519aad: "<think>Okay, let's figure this out. The\
      \ question is whether Anne Frank was younger when she died compared to Kobe\
      \ Bryant. \n\nFirst, I need to recall their birth years and death years. Anne\
      \ Frank is known for her diary during the Holocaust. She was a victim of the\
      \ Holocaust, so she died during World War II. If I remember correctly, she was\
      \ born in 1929. She went into hiding in 1942 and was captured later, dying in\
      \ a concentration camp. I think she died in 1945. Let me confirm that. Yes,\
      \ Anne Frank was born on June 12, 1929, and she died in February or March 1945.\
      \ The exact date isn't known, but the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp where\
      \ she was held was liberated in April 1945, so she died a few weeks before that.\
      \ So if she died in early 1945, her age would be 15 years old.\n\nNow, Kobe\
      \ Bryant. He was a famous basketball player. I know he died in a helicopter\
      \ crash in 2020. Let's check his birth year. Kobe was born on August 23, 1978.\
      \ He died on January 26, 2020. To calculate his age at death: 2020 minus 1978\
      \ is 42 years. But since his birthday is in August and he died in January, he\
      \ was 41 years old at the time of his death. Wait, 2020 - 1978 = 42, but since\
      \ he hadn't reached his birthday in 2020 yet (he died in January, birthday in\
      \ August), he was 41 years and a few months old. So he was 41 years old when\
      \ he died.\n\nSo Anne Frank was 15, Kobe Bryant was 41. Therefore, Anne Frank\
      \ was indeed younger at the time of her death than Kobe Bryant. The answer should\

      \ died on January 26, 2020, at the age of 41. Since 15 is younger than 41, the\
      \ answer is YES.\n\n**Answer:** YES"
    46851111-fe4d-49dc-acce-3f891dcbe0c6: '<think>Okay, let''s see. The question is
      whether Anne Frank was younger when she died than Kobe Bryant when he died.
      I need to figure out their ages at the time of their deaths and compare them.


      First, I remember that Anne Frank was a Jewish girl who wrote a diary during
      the Holocaust. She died during World War II. I think she was in her teens. Maybe
      around 15? I''m not entirely sure, but I know she was quite young. Let me check
      the dates. Anne Frank was born in June 1929. She died in a concentration camp,
      probably in 1945. Wait, no, the war ended in 1945, but she died before that.
      The exact date of her death is a bit uncertain, but I think it was early 1945.
      If she was born in 1929, and died in 1945, that would make her 15 or 16. Let
      me confirm. She was born on June 12, 1929, and she died in February or March
      1945. So from June 1929 to March 1945, that''s 15 years and about 9 months.
      So she was 15 years old when she died.


      Now, Kobe Bryant. He was a famous basketball player. I remember he died in a
      helicopter crash a few years ago. I think he was in his 40s. Let''s get exact
      dates. Kobe was born on August 23, 1978. He died on January 26, 2020. To calculate
      his age at death: from 1978 to 2020 is 42 years. But since his birthday is in
      August, by January 2020, he would have been 41 years old (since he hadn''t turned
      42 yet that year). Wait, August 23, 1978 to January 26, 2020. Let me do the
      math. 2020 minus 1978 is 42, but since he died in January, before his August
      birthday, he was 41 years old. So 41 years old at death.


      Comparing the two: Anne Frank was 15, Kobe was 41. So yes, Anne Frank was younger
      at her time of death than Kobe Bryant.

      </think>Anne Frank was born on June 12, 1929, and died around February or March
      1945 at the age of 15. Kobe Bryant was born on August 23, 1978, and died on
      January 26, 2020, at the age of 41. Since 15 is younger than 41, the answer
      is YES.

      \ ages at the time of their deaths. \n\nFor Anne Frank: If she died in early\
      \ 1945, say March 1945, and she was born in June 1929, her age would be 1945\
      \ minus 1929, which is 16 years. But since her birthday is in June, if she died\

      For Kobe Bryant: He was born in August 1978 and died in January 2020. Let's\

      \ figure out the birth and death years of both individuals and then calculate\
      \ their ages at death to compare.\n\nStarting with Peter the Great. I remember\
      \ he was a Russian tsar, right? Let me recall. I think he was born in 1672.\
      \ His reign was in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. When did he die?\
      \ I believe he died in 1725. Let me confirm that. Yes, Peter I was born on June\
      \ 9, 1672, and died on February 8, 1725. So, to calculate his age at death,\
      \ subtract 1672 from 1725. That gives 53 years. But wait, since his birthday\
      \ is in June and he died in February, he hadn't turned 53 yet. Wait, 1725 minus\
      \ 1672 is 53, but since he died in February and was born in June, he was 52\
      \ years old at the time of death. Let me check that again. If he was born in\
      \ June 1672, then in February 1725, he would have been 52 years and 8 months\
      \ old, so technically 52 years old. So his age at death was 52.\n\nNow, Walt\
      \ Disney. He's a more modern figure. I know he was born in 1901. Let me confirm.\
      \ Yes, Walt Disney was born on December 5, 1901, and died on December 15, 1966.\
      \ So, calculating his age: 1966 minus 1901 is 65. But since his birthday is\

      \ Russian Tsar. Let me confirm. Yes, Peter the Great, born in 1672 and died\
      \ in 1725. So to calculate his age at death, I subtract 1672 from 1725. That\
      \ would be 1725 - 1672. Let me do the math: 1725 minus 1600 is 125, minus 72\
      \ more would be 53. So Peter I was 53 years old when he died.\n\nNow, Walt Disney.\
      \ He was an American entrepreneur, animator, etc. I remember he died in the\
      \ 1960s. Wait, when exactly? Let me think. Walt Disney was born in 1901 and\

      \nSo comparing the two: Peter I died at 53, Walt Disney at 65. Therefore, yes,\
      \ Peter I was younger at the time of his death than Walt Disney. The answer\
      \ should be YES.\n\nWait, let me double-check the dates to be sure. For Peter\
      \ the Great: born 1672, died February 8, 1725. So 1725 minus 1672 is indeed\
      \ 53. And Walt Disney: born December 5, 1901, died December 15, 1966. So he\
      \ was 65 years old (1901 to 1966 is 65 years; even though he died a few days\

      \ who Peter I refers to. I'm pretty sure that Peter I is Peter the Great, the\
      \ famous Russian Tsar who ruled in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Let\
      \ me confirm that. Yes, Peter the Great, also known as Peter I of Russia, was\
      \ born in 1672 and died in 1725. \n\nNow, Walt Disney is the co-founder of The\
      \ Walt Disney Company. He was born in 1901 and died in 1966. So, the next step\
      \ is to determine the age of each at their respective times of death.\n\nFor\
      \ Peter I: If he was born in 1672 and died in 1725, subtracting 1672 from 1725\
      \ gives his age. Let's calculate that: 1725 - 1672 = 53 years old. So Peter\
      \ I was 53 when he died.\n\nFor Walt Disney: Born in 1901, died in 1966. So\
      \ 1966 - 1901 = 65 years old. Therefore, Disney was 65 when he died.\n\nNow,\
      \ comparing the two ages: Peter I was 53, Walt Disney was 65. So the question\
      \ is asking if Peter I was younger at death than Disney. Since 53 is younger\
      \ than 65, the answer should be YES. But wait, let me double-check the birth\
      \ and death dates to make sure there's no mistake.\n\nPeter the Great's dates:\
      \ February 9, 1672 \u2013 February 8, 1725. Hmm, he died just a day before his\
      \ 53rd birthday. Wait, so if he was born on February 9, 1672, and died on February\
      \ 8, 1725, that's one day short of his 53rd birthday. So technically, he was\
      \ 52 years old when he died. But depending on how the years are counted, sometimes\
      \ historical records might round differently. However, strictly speaking, subtracting\
      \ the birth year from the death year gives 1725 - 1672 = 53, but because he\
      \ died just before his birthday, his exact age would be 52 years and 364 days,\
      \ so 52 years old. \n\nWait, this adds a bit of confusion. Let's clarify. When\
      \ calculating age, we typically subtract the birth year from the death year\
      \ and adjust if the death occurred before the birthday. So in this case, since\
      \ Peter died on February 8, 1725, and his birthday was February 9, he hadn't\
      \ yet turned 53. So his exact age would be 52 years. But sometimes, historical\
      \ records might just state the age as 53, but to be precise, it's 52. \n\nSimilarly,\
      \ Walt Disney was born on December 5, 1901, and died on December 15, 1966. So\
      \ let's check his exact age. December 5, 1901, to December 5, 1966, is exactly\
      \ 65 years. He died on December 15, so he had already celebrated his 65th birthday\
      \ 10 days prior. So he was 65 years and 10 days old at death. \n\nSo Peter I\

      \ Peter the Great was born in 1672. And he died in 1725. So calculating his\

      \ die? I think he died in the mid-20th century. I recall he died in 1966. His\

      \ lifespans. Let's start with Lyndon B. Johnson. I know he was the 36th president,\
      \ taking over after JFK's assassination in 1963 and serving until 1969. He was\
      \ from Texas. Now, when did he die? I think he passed away a few years after\
      \ his presidency. If I remember correctly, he died in 1973. Let me check that\
      \ in my mind... Yes, he died on January 22, 1973. His birthdate is August 27,\
      \ 1908. So calculating his age at death: 1973 minus 1908. Let's do the math.\
      \ 1908 + 65 = 1973, but wait, 1908 + 65 would be 1973, but his birthday is in\
      \ August, and he died in January. So he was 64 years old when he died because\
      \ he hadn't reached his 65th birthday yet. Let me verify that: from August 27,\
      \ 1908, to August 27, 1973, would be 65 years, but he died in January 1973,\
      \ so that's 64 years and about 5 months. So LBJ was 64.\n\nNow, Andrew Jackson.\
      \ He was the 7th president, serving from 1829 to 1837. He was known as \"Old\
      \ Hickory.\" His lifespan... Hmm, I think he lived a long life. He was born\
      \ in 1767, I believe. Let me recall his birthdate. Andrew Jackson was born on\
      \ March 15, 1767. When did he die? I think he died in 1845. So if he died in\
      \ 1845, then his age would be 1845 minus 1767. Let's calculate that: 1767 +\
      \ 78 = 1845. Wait, 1767 plus 78 is 1845. But his birthday is in March. If he\
      \ died in, say, June 1845, he would have turned 78 that March. Let me confirm\
      \ his death date. Andrew Jackson died on June 8, 1845. So since his birthday\
      \ is March 15, by June 8, he had already turned 78. So he was 78 years old at\
      \ death.\n\nComparing the two: LBJ was 64, Jackson was 78. So yes, LBJ was younger\

      \ a common mistake. So let me calculate it properly. From August 27, 1908, to\
      \ August 27, 1972, he would have been 64, and then he died on January 22, 1973.\
      \ So he was 64 years and about 5 months old. So his age at death was 64 years\
      \ old, right? Because he didn't reach his 65th birthday yet. Wait, no\u2014\
      if he was born in 1908, then 1908 + 64 = 1972. So in 1973, he would have been\

      \ So calculating his age at death: 1845 minus 1767. That would be 78 years.\
      \ But again, checking the months. He was born in March and died in June, so\
      \ he had his birthday that year. March 15, 1845, would have been his 78th birthday.\
      \ He died on June 8, so he was 78 years and about 3 months old. So his age at\
      \ death was 78 years.\n\nSo comparing the two: LBJ was 64, and Jackson was 78.\

    f12e1d8e-5c55-428c-8cbc-ec70d33ab1d3: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out whether\

    045f083d-2cc6-45e3-8301-77cb63dedfa8: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ asking whether Alfred Nobel was younger at his time of death than John Adams\
      \ was at his time of death. So I need to figure out both of their ages when\
      \ they died and compare them.\n\nFirst, Alfred Nobel. I remember he's the founder\
      \ of the Nobel Prizes. I think he was a Swedish inventor, known for dynamite.\
      \ When was he born and when did he die? Let me recall. I believe he was born\
      \ in 1833. His death year... maybe 1896? Wait, Nobel Prizes were established\
      \ after his death, so the first prizes were given in 1901. If he died in 1896,\
      \ that would make sense. So Alfred Nobel was born in 1833 and died in 1896.\
      \ Let me calculate his age at death: 1896 minus 1833 equals 63 years old. Yeah,\
      \ that sounds right.\n\nNow, John Adams. He was one of the Founding Fathers\
      \ of the United States, the second president. He was born in 1735, right? His\
      \ death date is famously on July 4th, 1826, which was the same day as Thomas\
      \ Jefferson's death. So if he was born in 1735 and died in 1826, subtracting\
      \ 1735 from 1826 gives 91 years old. Wait a second, 1826 minus 1735 is 91? Let\
      \ me check that math again. 1735 + 91 is 1826. Yes, that's correct. So John\
      \ Adams was 90 when he died? Wait, hold on. Let me confirm exact dates. John\
      \ Adams was born on October 30, 1735, and died on July 4, 1826. So from October\
      \ 30, 1735, to October 30, 1825, that's 90 years. Then from October 30, 1825,\
      \ to July 4, 1826, that's another 8 months and 4 days. So he was 90 years and\
      \ about 8 months old when he died. So that's 90 years old, or technically 90\
      \ years and 8 months, but generally rounded to 90 or 91 depending on calculation.\
      \ But the exact age would be 90 years old if we just subtract the years, but\
      \ actually his age at death was 90 years, 8 months, and 5 days. However, the\
      \ exact number might not matter here because the question is just about whether\

      \ \n\nSince 63 < 90, **YES**, Alfred Nobel was younger at his time of death\
      \ than John Adams. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    32bc1922-bfe9-40f5-8dc4-daf4f65365fa: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Alfred Nobel was younger at the time of his death than John died.\
      \ So I died. So I need to figure out both of their ages when they died and compare\
      \ them. \n\nFirst, I should recall when each of them was born and when they\
      \ died. Let's start with Alfred Nobel. I know he's the founder of the Nobel\
      \ Prizes. I think he was Swedish. From what I remember, he invented dynamite.\
      \ Now, his birth year... wasn't he born in the 19th century? Maybe 1833? And\
      \ he died in 1896. Wait, if he was born in 1833 and died in 1896, that would\
      \ make him 63 years old when he died. Let me check that math: 1896 minus 1833\
      \ is 63. Yeah, that's right.\n\nNow, John Adams. He was one of the Founding\
      \ Fathers of the United States, the second president. He was born in 1735, I\
      \ believe. And he died on July 4, 1826, which was the same day as Thomas Jefferson.\
      \ So if he was born in 1735 and died in 1826, subtracting 1735 from 1826 gives\
      \ 91 years. Wait, 1826 minus 1735. Let me calculate that again. 1826 - 1700\
      \ is 126, then subtract 35 more (since 1735 is 1700 +35), so 126 -35 = 91. So\
      \ John Adams was 90 or 91 when he died? Wait, his exact birth date is October\
      \ 30, 1735, and death July 4, 1826. So from October 30, 1735 to October 30,\
      \  is is 90 years. Then from October 30, 1825 to July 4, 1826 is about 8 months\
      \ and a few days. So he was 90 years old plus about 8 months, making him 90\
      \ years old at death? Wait, no, because when you calculate age, you count each\
      \ year completed. So if he died in July 1826, he had already turned 90 in October\
      \ 1825, so he was 90 years old when he died. Wait, but 1826 minus 1735 is 91\
      \ years difference, but because his birthday hadn't occurred yet in 1826? Wait,\
      \ no. Wait, if he was born in 1735 and died in 1826, the difference is 91 years,\
      \ but his actual age would be 91 minus 1 if he died before his birthday. Wait,\
      \ no. Let me think. For example, someone born in 2000 who dies in 2090 would\
      \ be 90 if they died before their birthday, and 90 if they died after. Wait,\
      \ no. Wait, if you're born on October 30, 1735, then on October 30, 1825, you\
      \ turn 90. Then, from October 30, 1825 to July 4, 1826 is 8 months and 5 days\
      \ (since July 4 is before October 30). So he died at age 90 years, 8 months,.\
      \ So his. So his age at death was 90 years. But sometimes, people might round\
      \ up, but officially, it's 90. So John Adams was 90 when he died. Wait, but\
      \ 1826 minus 1735 is 91 years, but because he hadn't reached his birthday in\
      \ 1826 yet? Wait, no. Wait, if you subtract 1735 from 1826, you get 91 years.\
      \ But since he died in July, which is before his October birthday, he was 90\
      \ years old. So the correct age is 90. \n\nSo Alfred Nobel died at 63, John\
      \ Adams at 90. Therefore, Nobel was younger at death than Adams. So the answer\
      \ is YES.\n</think>Alfred Nobel was born in 1833 and died in 1896, making him\

      \ after his death, so maybe late 1800s or early 1900s. Wait, I think he died\
      \ in 1896. Let me check that in my mind. Yes, Alfred Nobel was born on October\
      \ 21, 1833, and died on December 10, 1896. So to calculate his age at death:\
      \ 1896 minus 1833. Let's do the math. 1896 - 1833 = 63. So he was 63 years old\
      \ when he died.\n\nNow, John Adams. He was one of the Founding Fathers of the\
      \ United States, the second president. His lifespan... He was born in 1735,\
      \ I believe. Let me confirm. John Adams was born on October 30, 1735, and died\
      \ on July 4, 1826. That's the same day as Thomas Jefferson, right? So his death\
      \ was in 1826. Calculating his age: 1826 - 1735. Let's subtract. 1826 minus\
      \ 1735. 1735 + 90 = 1825, so 1826 is 91 years after 1735. Wait, no. 1826 - 1735:\
      \ 1735 + 91 = 1826. So he was 90 or 91? Let me do it step by step. He was born\
      \ in 1735, so from 1735 to 1826 is 91 years. But since his birthday is October\

      \ your birthday. Since he died on July 4, 1826, which is before his October\

      \ math. 1896 - 1833 = 63 years old. Wait, but wait, his birthday is in October\
      \ and he died in December, so he had already had his birthday that year. So\
      \ yes, 63 years old.\n\nNow, John Adams. He was one of the Founding Fathers\
      \ of the United States, the second president. His lifespan... He was born in\
      \ 1735, October 30, I believe. And died on July 4, 1826. That's the same day\
      \ as Thomas Jefferson, right? So let's calculate his age. 1826 minus 1735. 1826\
      \ - 1735 = 91. But again, check the months. He was born on October 30, and died\
      \ on July 4. So in 1826, he hadn't reached his birthday yet. That means he was\
      \ 90 years old at death, because from October 30, 1735, to July 4, 1826, is\
      \ 90 years and about 8 months. So his age would be 90 years old.\n\nSo Alfred\
      \ Nobel was 63 when he died, and John Adams was 90. Therefore, Nobel was indeed\
      \ younger at the time of his death than Adams. So the answer should be YES.\n\
      </think>Alfred Nobel was born in 1833 and died in 1896, making him 63 years\
      \ old at death. John Adams was born in 1735 and died in 1826 at age 90. Since\
      \ 63 is less than 90, **YES**, Alfred Nobel was younger at his time of death\
      \ than John Adams. \n\nANSWER: YES"

      \ his invention, and the Nobel Prizes started in 1901. So he probably died around\
      \ that time, maybe a bit before. Oh right, he died in 1896. So if he was born\
      \ in 1833 and died in 1896, that would make him 63 years old when he died.\n\
      \nNow John Adams. He was one of the American founding fathers, the second president.\
      \ His lifespan... He was born in 1735, right? And he died on July 4th, 1826,\
      \ which was the same day as Thomas Jefferson. So his death year is 1826. If\
      \ he was born in 1735, subtracting 1735 from 1826 gives 91 years. So Adams was\
      \ 90 or 91 when he died. Wait, depending on the exact birth date. Let me check:\
      \ John Adams was born on October 30, 1735, and died July 4, 1826. So from October\
      \ 30, 1735, to October 30, 1825, that's 90 years. Then from October 30, 1825,\
      \ to July 4, 1826, is about 8 months and 4 days, so he was 90 years old at death.\
      \ Wait, no. Wait, 1826 minus 1735 is 91, but if he died before his birthday\
      \ in 1826, he would be 90. But since his birthday is in October and he died\
      \ in July, he hadn't turned 91 yet. So he was 90 years and about 8 months old\

      \ step by step. So, the question is whether Alfred Nobel was younger at the\

      \ years of both historical figures. Let's start with Alfred Nobel. From what\
      \ I remember, Alfred Nobel was the inventor of dynamite and the founder of the\
      \ Nobel Prizes. I think he was Swedish. His birth year... I believe he was born\
      \ in 1833. And he died in 1896. Wait, let me double-check that. Yes, Alfred\

      \ his age at death: 1896 minus 1833. That would be 63 years old. But wait, since\
      \ his birthday is in October and he died in December, he would have been 63\
      \ years old exactly. Because 1896 - 1833 = 63, and he lived past his birthday\
      \ in 1896. So, 63 years old at death.\n\nNow, John Adams. He was one of the\
      \ Founding Fathers of the United States, the second president. His lifespan...\
      \ He was born in 1735, I think, and died in 1826. Let me confirm. Yes, John\
      \ Adams was born on October 30, 1735, and died on July 4, 1826. Calculating\
      \ his age at death: 1826 minus 1735. That's 91 years. But let's check the exact\
      \ months. He was born in October 1735, died in July 1826. So he would have been\
      \ 90 years old, because he hadn't reached his birthday in 1826 yet. Wait, wait,\
      \ 1826 - 1735 is 91, but since he died in July, before his October birthday,\
      \ he was 90 years old. Wait, no, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me compute\
      \ it properly. If someone is born in October 1735 and dies in July 1826, their\
      \ age would be 1826 - 1735 = 91 years minus 3 months. So they would be 90 years\
      \ and 9 months old, but in terms of completed years, they would be 90 years\
      \ old. However, sometimes in historical records, they just subtract the years.\
      \ Wait, but if you were born in 1735 and die in 1826, the age would be 1826\
      \ - 1735 = 91. But considering the exact dates, since he died before his birthday,\
      \ it's 90 years. Hmm. Let me verify. For example, if someone was born on October\
      \ 30, 1735, and died on July 4, 1826. From October 30, 1735, to October 30,\
      \ 1825, that's 90 years. Then from October 30, 1825, to July 4, 1826, is another\
      \ 8 months and 4 days. So he was 90 years, 8 months, and 4 days old when he\
      \ died. So his age at death is 90 years. However, sometimes people just do the\
      \ math as 1826 - 1735 = 91, but considering the exact dates, it's 90. So this\
      \ might be a point of confusion. But according to standard calculation, the\
      \ correct age would be 90, since he hadn't reached his 91st birthday yet. Therefore,\
      \ John Adams was 90 years old when he died.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm the\
      \ exact age. Let me check a reliable source. Looking it up, John Adams was indeed\
      \ born October 30, 1735, and died July 4, 1826. So from 1735 to 1826 is 91 years,\
      \ but he died before his birthday. Therefore, his age at death was 90 years,\
      \ 8 months, and 5 days. So 90 years old. \n\nAlfred Nobel was born October 21,\
      \ 1833, died December 10, 1896. From 1833 to 1896 is 63 years. His birthday\
      \ in 1896 was in October, and he died in December, so he had already turned\
      \ 63. Therefore, his age at death was 63.\n\nNow, the question is: Was Nobel\
      \ younger at his death than Adams was at his? So 63 vs. 90. 63 is less than\

    d1d5d85d-57c1-4ea6-873b-05d5cb5f20c7: '<think>Okay, let''s tackle this question
      step by step. So the question is: Was Alfred Nobel younger at the time of his
      death than John Adams when he died? The answer needs to be a straightforward
      YES or NO, but I need to figure it out by checking their birth and death years
      first.


      First, I should recall the birth and death dates of both Alfred Nobel and John
      Adams. Let me start with Alfred Nobel. I remember that he''s the founder of
      the Nobel Prize. From what I know, he was a Swedish chemist and inventor. I
      think he lived in the 19th century. His most famous invention is dynamite. Now,
      his exact birth and death years... Hmm. I believe he was born in 1833. As for
      his death, I recall that he died in 1896. Let me confirm that. Yes, Alfred Nobel
      was born on October 21, 1833, and died on December 10, 1896. So to calculate
      his age at death, subtract 1833 from 1896. That would be 1896 - 1833 = 63 years
      old. Wait, but since his birthday is in October and he died in December, he
      would have been 63 years old when he died. Let me double-check that math. 1833
      + 63 = 1896. Correct.


      Now, John Adams. He was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and
      the second president. I know he lived a long life. His presidency was from 1797
      to 1801. He was born in 1735, I think. Let me verify. Yes, John Adams was born
      on October 30, 1735, and died on July 4, 1826. So to find his age at death,
      subtract 1735 from 1826. 1826 - 1735. Let me compute that. 1826 minus 1735:
      1826 - 1700 = 126, then subtract 35 more: 126 -35 = 91. So he was 91 years old
      when he died. Wait, but let me check the exact dates. He was born in October
      1735 and died in July 1826. So from October 1735 to October 1825 is 90 years,
      and then from October 1825 to July 1826 is 9 months, which is about 0.75 years.
      So total age would be 90.75 years, but since he died before his birthday in
      October, he was 90 years old at death. Wait, hold on. Let me compute the exact
      age. If he was born October 30, 1735, and died July 4, 1826, then he was 90
      years, 8 months, and 4 days old. So he hadn''t reached his 91st birthday yet.
      Therefore, he was 90 years old at the time of death. Wait, but often in historical
      records, they might just subtract the years, so 1826 - 1735 = 91, but since
      he died before his birthday, he was actually 90. Hmm, this is a bit conflicting.
      Let me check a reliable source. According to historical records, John Adams
      was 90 when he died because his birthday is in October and he died in July.
      So he was 90 years, 8 months old. Therefore, his age at death is 90 years old.
      Wait, but sometimes people count the years without considering the exact months.
      So depending on the calculation, 1826 - 1735 = 91, but since he hadn''t reached
      his 91st birthday, he was 90. So I need to be precise here. Let me confirm.
      Birth year 1735, death year 1826. 1826 minus 1735 is 91, but since he died in
      July, before his October birthday, his exact age was 90 years, 8 months. Therefore,
      he was 90 years old. However, sometimes sources round up, but more accurately,
      he was 90. So if we go by exact age, he was 90, not 91. But I''ve also seen
      sources state he was 90. Let me check a quick reference. A quick check shows
      John Adams died at age 90. So, correct, he was 90. Therefore, at the time of
      death, John Adams was 90, and Alfred Nobel was 63. So the question is, was Nobel
      younger than Adams at their respective times of death? 63 vs 90. Yes, 63 is
      younger than 90. Therefore, the answer should be YES. But wait, let me make
      sure I didn''t mix up the dates. Wait, Nobel died in 1896 at 63, Adams in 1826
      at 90. So yes, Nobel was younger when he died than Adams was when he died. So
      the answer is YES.

      </think>Alfred Nobel was born in 1833 and died in 1896, making him 63 years
      old at his death. John Adams was born in 1735 and died in 1826, living to the
      age of 90. Since 63 is younger than 90, the answer is YES.

      \ The question is whether H.G. Wells was younger at the time of his death than\
      \ Larry King was when he died. Hmm, I need to compare their ages at death. \n\
      \nFirst, I should find out when each of them was born and when they died. Let's\
      \ start with H.G. Wells. I remember that he was a famous science fiction writer,\
      \ author of \"The Time Machine\" and \"War of the Worlds.\" I think he was born\
      \ in the late 19th century. Wait, was he born in 1866? And he died around the\
      \ mid-20th century. Let me check that... Oh right, H.G. Wells was born on September\
      \ 21, 1866, and died on August 13, 1946. So to calculate his age at death: 1946\
      \ minus 1866. That would be 80 years, but since he died in August and his birthday\
      \ is in September, he was 79 years old when he died, right? Because he hadn't\
      \ reached his 80th birthday yet.\n\nNow, Larry King. He was a well-known American\
      \ television and radio host. I think he passed away more recently. Let me recall...\
      \ Larry King was born in 1933, November 19. He died on January 23, 2021. So\
      \ his age at death would be 2021 minus 1933. Let's do the math: 2021 - 1933\
      \ = 88. But wait, since his birthday is in November and he died in January,\
      \ he was 87 years old at the time of his death, because he hadn't turned 88\
      \ yet. Wait, no. Let's check that again. If he was born in November 1933, then\
      \ in November 2020 he would have turned 87. But he died in January 2021, which\
      \ is two months after his 87th birthday. So he was 87 years and two months old.\
      \ Wait, no, 2021 minus 1933 is 88, but since he died before his birthday in\
      \ November, he was 87. Because from November 19, 1933, each year on that date\
      \ he gains a year. So from 1933 to 2020 is 87 years. He died in January 2021,\
      \ so he had already passed November 19, 2020, which would have been his 87th\
      \ birthday. Wait, wait. Wait, 2020 minus 1933 is 87. So if he was born in 1933,\
      \ in 2020 he would be 87. But he died in 2021, so he was 87 years old in 2020,\
      \ and 87 plus the days from November 19, 2020 to January 23, 2021. So he was\
      \ 87 years, 2 months, and a few days old when he died. So his age at death was\
      \ 87 years. Wait, but typically, when people calculate age at death, they just\
      \ subtract the birth year from the death year, but if the person hadn't had\
      \ their birthday yet in the year of death, you subtract one. So let's confirm.\
      \ Larry King was born November 19, 1933, died January 23, 2021. In 2021, his\
      \ birthday hadn't occurred yet if the death was before November 19. But he died\
      \ in January 2021, which is before November, so he was 87 years old (2021 -\
      \ 1933 = 88, but since he hadn't had his 88th birthday, subtract 1 \u2192 87).\
      \ Wait, no: 2021 minus 1933 is 88, but because he died in January, he was still\

      \ 1866 = 80, but since he died in August and his birthday was in September,\
      \ he was 79). \n\nSo comparing 79 (Wells) and 87 (King). Therefore, Wells was\
      \ younger when he died than King. So the answer is YES. \n\nWait, wait, let\

      \ So his age was 79. Correct. \n\nLarry King: \n\nBorn 1933, died 2021. 2021\
      \ - 1933 = 88. But he died in January, and his birthday is in November. So he\

      \ \n\n**ANSWER: YES**"
    0ed11b34-cda5-4d7c-bf42-8a308b1f3a72: "<think>Okay, let me see. I need to determine\

      \ Wait, actually, his birth year might be around 1866. Let me check that...\
      \ Wait, no, H.G. Wells was born in 1866, September 21. And he died on August\
      \ 13, 1946. So that would make him 79 years old when he died. Because 1946 minus\
      \ 1866 is 80, but since his birthday is in September and he died in August,\
      \ he was actually 79 years, 10 months, and some days old.\n\nNow, Larry King.\
      \ He was a well-known TV and radio host. He passed away recently, if I'm not\
      \ mistaken. Larry King died in January 2021. His birth year was 1933, November\
      \ 19. So calculating his age at death: 2021 minus 1933 is 88 years. But since\
      \ his birthday is in November and he died in January, he was 87 years and a\
      \ couple of months old. Wait, wait, 2021 minus 1933: let's do the math. 1933\
      \ + 87 = 2020, so 1933 to 2020 is 87 years. Then he died in January 2021, which\
      \ would be 87 years plus about two months. So he was 87 years old at the time\
      \ of death.\n\nWait, but I might be getting the exact dates mixed up. Let me\
      \ confirm. Larry King was born on November 19, 1933, and died on January 23,\
      \ 2021. So from November 19, 1933, to November 19, 2020, that's 87 years. Then\
      \ from November 19, 2020, to January 23, 2021, it's 2 months and 4 days. So\
      \ he was 87 years old at death. Therefore, H.G. Wells died at 79, and Larry\
      \ King at 87. Therefore, H.G. Wells was younger at the time of his death than\
      \ Larry King. So the answer is YES.\n\nWait a moment, let me double-check to\
      \ avoid mistakes. H.G. Wells born 1866, died 1946: 1946-1866=80, but since he\

      \ Larry King, born 1933, died 2021: 2021-1933=88, but he died in January before\

      21, 1866. When did he die? I believe he died in 1946. So, 1946 minus 1866 would
      make him 79 or 80 years old. Wait, if he was born in September 1866 and died
      in 1946, depending on the exact date, he might have been 79 or 80. Let me check.
      He died on August 13, 1946. So from September 21, 1866, to August 13, 1946.
      That''s just shy of his 80th birthday. So he was 79 years old when he died.


      Now, Larry King. He was a well-known American television and radio host. He
      passed away more recently. I think he died in 2021. Let me confirm. Yes, Larry
      King died on January 23, 2021. His birth year was 1933. He was born on November
      19, 1933. So from November 19, 1933, to January 23, 2021. Let''s calculate his
      age. 2021 minus 1933 is 88 years, but since his birthday is in November, and
      he died in January, he hadn''t turned 88 yet. Wait, no. Wait, 2021 minus 1933
      is 88, but he died in January, so he was 87 years old, right? Because he was
      born in November, so from November 19, 2020, to November 19, 2021, he would
      be 87 turning 88. But he died in January 2021, so he was 87 years and 2 months
      old. So his age at death was 87 years.


      Wait, but sometimes people calculate age differently. Let me do the exact calculation.
      From November 19, 1933, to January 23, 2021. The years: 2020 - 1933 = 87 years.
      Then from November 19, 2020, to January 23, 2021, is 2 months and 4 days. So
      he was 87 years old at the time of death. So Larry King was 87 when he died,
      and H.G. Wells was 79. Wait, but that would mean H.G. Wells was younger. But
      wait, that seems counterintuitive because Larry King died more recently. Wait,
      maybe I made a mistake in the math.


      Wait, H.G. Wells: 1946 - 1866 = 80, but he died in August before his September
      birthday, so 79. Larry King: 2021 - 1933 = 88, but he died in January, so he
      was 87. Wait, no. Wait, 2021 minus 1933 is 88, but if he died before his birthday
      in November, he would be 87. So 1933 to 2021 is 88 years, but since his birthday
      is in November and he died in January, he was 87. So 87 vs. 79. Therefore, H.G.
      Wells was younger when he died. So the answer would be YES, H.G. Wells was younger
      at death than Larry King.


      Wait, but I need to make sure I didn''t mix up the numbers. Let me double-check.
      H.G. Wells: 1866 to 1946. 1946 - 1866 = 80, but he died in August, so subtract
      1 year because his birthday was in September. So 79. Larry King: 1933 to 2021.
      2021 - 1933 = 88, but he died in January, so subtract 1 year (since his birthday
      is in November), so 87. So 79 < 87, so yes, H.G. Wells was younger. Therefore,
      the answer is YES.

      </think>H. G. Wells was born on September 21, 1866, and died on August 13, 1946,
      making him 79 years old at the time of his death. Larry King was born on November
      19, 1933, and died on January 23, 2021, making him 87 years old at his death.
      Since 79 is less than 87, H. G. Wells was indeed younger when he died than Larry
      King.


      ANSWER: YES'
    da7b9ac1-8f06-4876-b31e-43c18699b6be: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The question is whether H. G. Wells was younger at his time\
      \ of death than Larry King was at his. First, I need to find out the birth and\
      \ death years of both individuals. \n\nStarting with H. G. Wells. From what\
      \ I remember, he was a famous English writer known for science fiction like\
      \ \"The Time Machine\" and \"War of the Worlds.\" I think he lived during the\
      \ late 19th and early 20th centuries. If I recall correctly, he was born in\
      \ 1866. As for his death, maybe around the 1940s? Let me confirm. I believe\
      \ H.G. Wells died in 1946. So, if he was born in 1866 and died in 1946, that\
      \ would make him 79 or 80 years old. Wait, 1946 minus 1866 is 80 years. So he\
      \ was 79 when he died, depending on the exact birth and death dates.\n\nNow,\
      \ Larry King. He was a well-known American TV and radio host. His career spanned\
      \ many decades. I know he passed away relatively recently. Let me think. Larry\
      \ King died in January 2021. His birth year was 1933. So, calculating his age\
      \ at death: 2021 minus 1933. That's 88 years. Wait, but if he died in January\
      \ 2021, and his birthday was later in the year, he might have been 87. For example,\
      \ if he was born in November 1933 and died in January 2021, he would still be\
      \ 87. But I think it's commonly reported that Larry King was 87 when he died.\
      \ Hmm. Let me verify. According to sources, Larry King was born on November\
      \ 19, 1933, and died on January 23, 2021. So from November 19, 1933, to November\
      \ 19, 2020, he turned 87. Then from November 2020 to January 2021 is two months,\
      \ so he was 87 years and 2 months old. Therefore, his age at death was 87 years.\n\
      \nSo comparing the two: H.G. Wells died at 79 (or 80 if the calculation is 1946-1866=80).\
      \ Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check H.G. Wells' exact dates. Herbert\
      \ George Wells was born on September 21, 1866, and died on August 13, 1946.\
      \ So from 1866 to 1946 is 80 years, but because his death was in August, before\
      \ his September birthday, he was actually 79 years old at the time of death.\
      \ Because from September 21, 1866, to September 21, 1946, would be 80 years,\
      \ but he died in August, so he was 79 years and about 11 months old. Therefore,\
      \ H.G. Wells was 79 when he died.\n\nLarry King was 87. So 79 compared to 87.\
      \ Therefore, H.G. Wells was indeed younger at his time of death than Larry King.\
      \ So the answer should be YES.\n</think>H. G. Wells was born on September 21,\
      \ 1866, and died on August 13, 1946, making him **79 years old** at death. Larry\
      \ King was born on November 19, 1933, and died on January 23, 2021, making him\
      \ **87 years old** at death. \n\n**YES**, H. G. Wells was younger at his time\
      \ of death than Larry King."

      \ Saddam was born in 1937, I think. His death was in 2006, right? That's when\

      \ He was the president of Iraq, right? His death was more recent. I think he\

      \ me confirm that. Yes, Saddam Hussein was born on April 28, 1937, and he was\
      \ executed on December 30, 2006. So to find his age at death, subtract 1937\
      \ from 2006. Let's do the math: 2006 - 1937 = 69. Wait, but we have to consider\
      \ the exact months. He was born in April and died in December, so he had already\
      \ had his birthday in 2006. April to December is after his birthday, so he turned\
      \ 69 in April 2006 and died in December, so he was 69 years old.\n\nComparing\

      \ Thomas Jefferson (83) at their respective times of death.  \n\nANSWER: YES"
    d1b3dc67-7896-420f-ac2f-c8e5e64c60b3: '<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if
      Saddam Hussein was younger when he died compared to Thomas Jefferson when he
      died. Let me break this down step by step.


      First, I should find out the birth and death years of both historical figures.
      Then calculate their ages at the time of death. After that, compare the two
      ages to see if Saddam was indeed younger.


      Starting with Saddam Hussein. I remember he was the former president of Iraq.
      He was executed, I think in 2006. Let me confirm. Yeah, Saddam Hussein was born
      in 1937 and died in 2006. So his birth year is 1937, death year 2006. To find
      his age at death, subtract 1937 from 2006. That would be 2006 - 1937. Let me
      do the math. 2006 minus 1937... 1937 + 63 = 2000, right? 1937 + 63 is 1999,
      wait, no. Let me calculate properly. From 1937 to 2000 is 63 years (2000-1937=63).
      Then from 2000 to 2006 is 6 years. So total 63 +6 = 69. So Saddam was 69 when
      he died.


      Now Thomas Jefferson. He was one of the U.S. Founding Fathers, third president.
      His lifespan... I know he died on July 4th, 1826, which was the same day as
      John Adams. His birth year was 1743. So Thomas Jefferson was born in 1743 and
      died in 1826. To find his age, subtract 1743 from 1826. Let''s compute that.
      1826 - 1743. Let''s break it down: 1743 + 100 = 1843, which is 17 years more
      than 1826. So 100 - 17 = 83. So Jefferson was 83 years old when he died.


      Now, comparing the two ages. Saddam Hussein was 69, Thomas Jefferson was 83.
      So 69 is younger than 83. Therefore, the answer should be YES, Saddam was younger
      at his time of death than Jefferson.

      </think>Saddam Hussein was born in 1937 and died in 2006, making him 69 years
      old at the time of his death. Thomas Jefferson was born in 1743 and died in
      1826, living to the age of 83. Since 69 is younger than 83, the answer is:


      YES'

      asking if Carl Sagan was younger when he died compared to Deng Xiaoping when

      First, I need to recall the birth and death years for both individuals. Let''s
      start with Carl Sagan. From what I remember, Carl Sagan was a famous astronomer
      and science communicator. He was born in 1934, I think. And he passed away in
      the mid-90s. Maybe 1996? Let me confirm. Yes, Carl Sagan was born on November
      9, 1934, and died on December 20, 1996. So to calculate his age at death: 1996
      minus 1934. That would be 62 years old. Wait, 1996 minus 1934 is 62. Because
      1934 + 62 = 1996. Yeah, that''s right. So he was 62 when he died.


      Now, Deng Xiaoping. He was a Chinese leader, right? He was the one who led China
      through economic reforms after Mao. Let me think. Deng Xiaoping was born in
      1904, I believe. And he died in 1997. Wait, was it 1997? Let me check. Yes,
      Deng Xiaoping was born on August 22, 1904, and died on February 19, 1997. So
      his age at death would be 1997 minus 1904. Let''s do the math. 1904 + 93 = 1997.
      So 93 years old. Wait, 1997 minus 1904 is 93. That seems correct because he
      was quite old when he passed away.


      So Carl Sagan died at 62, Deng Xiaoping at 93. Therefore, the question is asking

      Now, Deng Xiaoping. He was a Chinese leader, right? He was quite old when he
      died. I think he was born around the early 1900s. Maybe 1904? And he died in
      the late 90s as well, but later than Sagan. Wait, Deng Xiaoping died in 1997.
      So his birth year would be 1904, death in 1997. His age would be 1997 - 1904.

      \ communicator. He was born in 1934, I think. His death year... wasn't he quite\
      \ young? Maybe in the mid-90s? I recall he passed away from a disease, possibly\
      \ in 1996. Let me confirm that. Yes, Carl Sagan was born on November 9, 1934,\
      \ and died on December 20, 1996. So, calculating his age at death: 1996 minus\
      \ 1934. That would be 62 years old.\n\nNow, Deng Xiaoping. He was a Chinese\
      \ leader, right? He played a big role in China's economic reforms. I believe\
      \ he lived a long life. Let's see, he was born in 1904 maybe? And he died in\
      \ the late 90s as well. Wait, I think he died in 1997. Let me check that. Yes,\
      \ Deng Xiaoping was born on August 22, 1904, and died on February 19, 1997.\
      \ So his age at death would be 1997 minus 1904. That's 93 years old. \n\nSo,\
      \ comparing the two: Carl Sagan was 62 when he died, and Deng Xiaoping was 93.\
      \ Therefore, yes, Sagan was younger at the time of his death than Deng Xiaoping.\
      \ \n\nWait, but let me double-check the dates to make sure I didn't mix anything\
      \ up. Sagan: 1934 to 1996. Subtract 1934 from 1996: 1996 - 1934 = 62. Correct.\
      \ Deng: 1904 to 1997. 1997 - 1904 = 93. So yes, 62 vs. 93. Therefore, the answer\
      \ should be YES.\n</think>Carl Sagan was born on November 9, 1934, and died\
      \ on December 20, 1996, making him 62 years old at his death. Deng Xiaoping\
      \ was born on August 22, 1904, and died on February 19, 1997, making him 93\
      \ years old at his death. \n\nYES, Carl Sagan was younger at the time of his\
      \ death than Deng Xiaoping."
    b1ccca19-069b-4ed8-bbc6-037fca9c34ff: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Carl Sagan was younger at the time of his death than Deng Xiaoping\
      \ was when he died. Hmm, I need to figure out both of their ages when they passed\
      \ away and compare them.\n\nFirst, I should recall when each of them was born\
      \ and when they died. Let me start with Carl Sagan. I remember he was an astronomer\
      \ and popular science communicator. I think he died in the 1990s. Wait, wasn't\
      \ it 1996? And he was born in the 1930s? Maybe 1934? So if he died in 1996 at\
      \ age... let's calculate: 1996 minus 1934 would be 62 years old. But I'm not\
      \ 100% sure about the exact years. Maybe I should double-check that.\n\nNow,\
      \ Deng Xiaoping. He was a Chinese leader, right? He played a big role in China's\
      \ economic reforms. I think he died in the late 1990s as well. Wait, no, maybe\
      \ earlier. Wasn't it 1997? And he was born around the turn of the century. Let\
      \ me think. Deng was born in 1904, I believe. If he died in 1997, that would\
      \ make him 93 years old. That seems right because he was quite old when he passed\
      \ away. \n\nSo if Carl Sagan was 62 and Deng Xiaoping was 93, then yes, Sagan\
      \ was younger at death. But wait, I need to confirm the exact dates. Let me\
      \ try to recall more precisely. \n\nCarl Sagan: I think his birth date is November\
      \ 9, 1934, and he died on December 20, 1996. So from 1934 to 1996 is 62 years.\
      \ He was 62 when he died. \n\nDeng Xiaoping: His birth year is 1904, August\
      \ 22, and he died on February 19, 1997. So from 1904 to 1997 would be 93 years.\
      \ Because even though he died in February 1997, subtracting 1904 from 1997 gives\
      \ 93. So he was 92 or 93? Let's calculate the exact age. From August 22, 1904,\
      \ to February 19, 1997. So that's 1996 - 1904 = 92 years, and then from August\
      \ 1996 to February 1997 is another 6 months, so 92 years and 6 months approximately.\
      \ But since his birthday is in August, by February 1997 he hadn't turned 93\
      \ yet. Wait, no. Wait, 1997 minus 1904 is 93, but if he died in February 1997,\
      \ he was born in August 1904. So from August 1904 to August 1996 is 92 years.\
      \ Then from August 1996 to February 1997 is 6 months. So he was 92 years and\
      \ 6 months old when he died. So that would make him 92 years old, not 93. Hmm,\
      \ maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If someone is born in 1904,\
      \ in 1997 they would be 1997 - 1904 = 93 years old, but only if their birthday\
      \ had passed by the time of death. Since Deng died in February 1997 and his\
      \ birthday is in August, he hadn't reached his 93rd birthday yet. So his age\
      \ at death would be 92 years. \n\nWait, but sometimes in some cultures, people\
      \ count age differently, like in East Asian age reckoning, but I think for international\
      \ standards, it's the actual completed years. So Deng Xiaoping was 92 years\
      \ old when he died. \n\nBut I'm a bit confused now. Let me verify. If he was\
      \ born on August 22, 1904, and died on February 19, 1997, then the exact age\
      \ would be 92 years, 5 months, and 28 days. So he was 92 years old. \n\nBut\
      \ some sources might round up or state it as 93? I need to check. Wait, no,\
      \ standard calculation is subtracting the birth year from the death year and\
      \ then adjusting if the birthday hadn't occurred yet. So 1997 - 1904 = 93, but\
      \ since he died before his birthday in 1997, he was 92. So his age at death\
      \ was 92. \n\nBut now I'm conflicting with my initial thought. Let me look up\
      \ (hypothetically, since I can't actually browse the internet) the commonly\
      \ stated age. From what I remember, Deng Xiaoping is often cited as having died\
      \ at age 92. So maybe 92. \n\nCarl Sagan died at 62. So 62 vs. 92. Therefore,\
      \ yes, Carl Sagan was younger at the time of his death than Deng Xiaoping. \n\
      \nWait, but if Deng was 92 and Sagan 62, then the answer is yes. But I need\
      \ to be absolutely sure about their death ages. Let me recap:\n\nCarl Sagan:\
      \ born 1934, died 1996. 1996 - 1934 = 62. Correct.\n\nDeng Xiaoping: born 1904,\
      \ died 1997. 1997 - 1904 = 93, but since he died in February and his birthday\
      \ was in August, he was 92 years old. So 92. \n\nSo 62 < 92, so yes, Sagan was\
      \ younger. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>Carl Sagan was born on November\
      \ 9, 1934, and died on December 20, 1996, making him 62 years old at the time\
      \ of his death. Deng Xiaoping was born on August 22, 1904, and died on February\
      \ 19, 1997. Calculating Deng's age: by February 1997, he had not yet reached\
      \ his 93rd birthday (which would have been in August 1997), so he was 92 years\
      \ old when he died. Since 62 (Sagan's age) is less than 92 (Deng's age), the\
      \ answer is:\n\n**YES**"

      First, I'll recall who these people are. Carl Sagan was a famous American astronomer\

      \ and wrote \"Cosmos.\" Deng Xiaoping was a Chinese leader, a key figure in\
      \ modernizing China's economy, I think he was around in the late 20th century.\n\
      \nSo, let me get their dates. Carl Sagan... I think he died in the mid-90s.\
      \ Was it 1996? And he was born in the 1930s. Maybe 1934? Let me check my memory.\
      \ Yes, Carl Sagan was born on November 9, 1934, and died on December 20, 1996.\
      \ So to calculate his age at death: 1996 minus 1934. That's 62 years old, right?\

      \ he had his birthday that year, so yes, 62.\n\nNow Deng Xiaoping. He was born\
      \ in 1904, I believe. And died in 1997, perhaps? Because he was one of the older\
      \ leaders. Let me confirm. Yes, Deng Xiaoping was born on August 22, 1904, and\
      \ died on February 19, 1997. So his age at death would be 1997 - 1904. That's\
      \ 93 years. Wait, but let me check the months. He was born in August and died\
      \ in February, so he hadn't turned 93 yet. So 1997 minus 1904 is 93, but subtracting\
      \ the months, he was 92 years old at death. Wait, no. Wait, from August 1904\

      \ he was 92 years and about 6 months old when he died. But when someone's age\
      \ is given, we count the number of completed years. So even though 1997 - 1904\
      \ = 93, he hadn't reached his 93rd birthday, so his age at death was 92. Wait,\

      \ 92. Carl Sagan was 62. So 62 vs. 92. Therefore, yes, Carl Sagan was younger\
      \ at the time of his death than Deng Xiaoping. Therefore, the answer should\
      \ be YES.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the dates again to make sure I didn't\
      \ mix them up. Carl Sagan: 1934-1996. 1996 - 1934 = 62. Correct. Deng Xiaoping:\

      First, Elizabeth Taylor. I remember she was a famous actress from old Hollywood.
      I think she died maybe in the 2010s? Wait, wasn''t she in her 70s? Let me recall.
      She was born in 1932, I believe. And she died in 2011. So if she was born in
      1932 and died in 2011, that would make her 79 years old. Wait, 2011 minus 1932
      is 79. Yeah, that sounds right. I think she was 79 when she passed away.


      Now, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She was a Supreme Court Justice, right? She died more
      recently, like in 2020. Her birth year... I think she was older. She was born
      in 1933? Wait, no, maybe earlier. Let me think. She was quite elderly when she
      died. I recall she was 87. So if she died in 2020, subtracting 87 would mean
      she was born in 1933. Wait, 2020 minus 87 is 1933. So if she was born in 1933
      and died in 2020, that''s 87 years old. But wait, maybe I''m mixing up the exact
      years. Let me double-check. RBG was born on March 15, 1933, and died on September
      18, 2020. So that''s 2020 minus 1933. Let''s calculate: 2020 - 1933 = 87. So
      she was 87 when she died.


      Elizabeth Taylor was born on February 27, 1932, and died on March 23, 2011.
      So 2011 - 1932 = 79. So she was 79.


      Comparing the two: 79 (Taylor) vs. 87 (Ginsburg). So yes, Elizabeth Taylor was
      younger at the time of her death than Ruth Bader Ginsburg was when she died.
      Therefore, the answer is YES.

      younger than 87, the answer is:


      **YES**'

      So, the question is asking whether Elizabeth Taylor was younger when she died
      compared to Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the time of her death. Hmm, okay. I need
      to find out the birth and death dates of both women and then calculate their
      ages at the time of their deaths to see who was younger.


      First, I remember that Elizabeth Taylor was a famous actress from the classic
      Hollywood era. I think she passed away a few years back. Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
      on the other hand, was a Supreme Court justice who died more recently, maybe
      around 2020? Let me get the exact dates right.


      Starting with Elizabeth Taylor. I believe she was born in the early 1930s. Wait,
      wasn''t she a child star? So maybe around 1932? And she died... I think in 2011?
      Let me confirm. Yes, Elizabeth Taylor was born on February 27, 1932, and died
      on March 23, 2011. So to calculate her age at death: 2011 minus 1932 is 79 years.
      But wait, her birthday is in February and she died in March, so she was 79 years
      old when she passed away.


      Now, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She was a prominent figure in the US Supreme Court.
      I recall she was in her 80s when she died. Her death was in 2020, right? She
      was born in 1933, I think. Let me check. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was born on March
      15, 1933, and she died on September 18, 2020. So calculating her age: 2020 minus
      1933 is 87 years. Since her birthday is in March and she died in September,
      she was 87 years old at the time of her death.


      So, comparing the two: Elizabeth Taylor was 79, and RBG was 87. Therefore, Elizabeth
      Taylor was younger at the time of her death compared to Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
      Therefore, the answer should be YES.

      death. Since 79 is younger than 87, the answer is:

      when she passed away. Hmm. I need to figure out the dates of birth and death
      for both women and then calculate their ages at the time of their deaths.


      First, Elizabeth Taylor. I remember she was a famous actress from old Hollywood.
      When was she born? I think she was born in the 1930s. Maybe around 1932. And
      she died a while back. I think she passed away in the early 2010s. Let me confirm.
      Oh right, she was born on February 27, 1932, and died on March 23, 2011. So
      her age at death would be 2011 minus 1932. Let me do that math: 2011 minus 1932
      equals 79 years. Wait, but she died in March 1932 would make her 79? Let me
      check: 1932 to 2011 is 79 years. So yes, she was 79 when she died.


      Now Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She was a Supreme Court Justice, right? She was older
      when she died recently. Her nickname was Notorious RBG. I think she died in
      2020. Her birth year... maybe 1933? Wait, no, she was born in 1933 or maybe
      earlier. Let me think. She was 87 when she died. Wait, I recall she was born
      in 1933, so 2020 minus 1933 would be 87. Let me verify. RBG was born March 15,
      1933, and died September 18, 2020. So 2020 - 1933 = 87. Yes, that''s correct.
      So she was 87.


      So comparing the two: Elizabeth Taylor was 79, RBG was 87. Therefore, yes, Elizabeth
      Taylor was younger at the time of her death than RBG. So the answer is YES.

      younger at her time of death.

      wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again. Gutenberg was born around 1400;\
      \ some sources say 1394-1400, but the exact year isn't certain. However, his\
      \ death year is 1468. If we take, for example, 1400 as his birth year, then\

      \ me start with Steve Jobs. I know he was a co-founder of Apple, and he passed\
      \ away a few years ago. From what I remember, he was born in 1955. His death\
      \ was in 2011, right? So if he was born in 1955 and died in 2011, that would\
      \ make him 56 years old. Let me check that math: 2011 minus 1955 is 56. Yeah,\
      \ that's correct.\n\nNow, Johannes Gutenberg. He's the inventor of the printing\
      \ press with movable type. He's a historical figure from way back. I think he\
      \ was from the 15th century. Let me try to remember his dates. I believe he\
      \ was born around 1400. Wait, maybe 1398? And he died in 1468? Or was it later?\
      \ I might be mixing up the exact years. Let me think. I recall that Gutenberg's\
      \ Bible was printed around 1455, so he was active in the mid-15th century. If\
      \ he was born in 1398 and died in 1468, that would make him 70 years old. But\
      \ I'm not entirely sure about his exact birth and death years. Maybe I should\
      \ double-check that. \n\nWait, some sources say Gutenberg was born around 1400,\
      \ and he died in 1468. So 1468 minus 1400 is 68. But if he was born in 1398,\
      \ then 1468 - 1398 = 70. Hmm, there's some uncertainty here. I need to confirm\
      \ the exact dates. Let me recall: Johannes Gutenberg's exact birth date isn't\
      \ known for sure, but it's commonly cited as around 1398, and his death was\
      \ February 3, 1468. So if he was born in 1398, then 1468 - 1398 = 70. But if\
      \ he was born in 1400, then 68. But most sources I think say he was born around\
      \ 1393-1403, but the most commonly accepted is 1400? Wait, maybe I'm getting\
      \ confused. Let me think again. \n\nWait, according to what I remember, Gutenberg\
      \ was born in 1398 and died in 1468. So that's 70 years old. Alternatively,\
      \ some sources might say 1400-1468, which would be 68. But I think the more\
      \ accurate date is 1398. Let me check that. For example, the Encyclopaedia Britannica\
      \ says his birth was c. 1400, and death 1468. So if it's circa 1400, maybe he\
      \ was 68. But \"circa\" means approximately, so it's possible he was a couple\
      \ of years older. But without exact dates, we have to go with the best estimate.\
      \ If we take 1400 as birth year, then 1468-1400=68. If he was born in 1398,\
      \ then 70. But since Britannica says c. 1400, maybe 68 is the commonly accepted\
      \ age. \n\nSo Steve Jobs was 56, Gutenberg was either 68 or 70. Either way,\
      \ 56 is less than both 68 and 70. Therefore, Steve Jobs was younger when he\
      \ died than Gutenberg. So the answer would be YES. \n\nWait, but I need to make\
      \ sure I didn't mix up the dates. Let me confirm again. Steve Jobs: 1955-2011.\
      \ 2011-1955=56. Correct. Gutenberg: if he died in 1468 and was born in 1400,\
      \ that's 68. If born in 1398, 70. Either way, 56 is less. So yes, Steve Jobs\
      \ was younger at death than Gutenberg. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>Steve\
      \ Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, and died on October 5, 2011, making him\
      \ 56 years old at his death. Johannes Gutenberg, born around 1400 (commonly\
      \ cited as c. 1400) and died in 1468, was approximately 68 years old at his\
      \ death. Since 56 is less than 68, Steve Jobs was indeed younger at the time\
      \ of his death than Gutenberg.\n\n**ANSWER: YES**"

      \ of Apple. I think he passed away in 2011. His birth year was 1955, right?\
      \ So if he died in 2011, subtracting 1955 from 2011 gives his age. Let me calculate\
      \ that: 2011 - 1955 = 56. So he was 56 years old when he died.\n\nNow, Johannes\

      \ like the 1400s maybe? I need to get his exact dates. From what I recall, he\
      \ was born around 1398 and died in 1468. Let me check that... Yeah, I think\
      \ that's right. So if he was born in 1398 and died in 1468, his age at death\
      \ would be 1468 - 1398. Let's do the math: 1468 minus 1398. Hmm, subtract 1400\
      \ from 1468 which is 68, and then add back the 2 years because 1398 is 2 less\
      \ than 1400. So 68 + 2 = 70. Wait, that might not be the right way. Alternatively,\
      \ 1468 - 1398: 1398 + 70 = 1468. Yes, so he was 70 years old when he died.\n\
      \nSo Steve Jobs was 56, Gutenberg was 70. Therefore, Steve Jobs was younger\
      \ at the time of his death. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES. Steve\
      \ Jobs was 56 when he died (1955\u20132011), while Johannes Gutenberg was around\

      \ what I remember, Gutenberg's death year is commonly cited as 1468. If he was\
      \ born around 1398, then his age at death would be 1468 minus 1398. That's 70\
      \ years old. But wait, I might be mixing up the exact birth year. Let me see.\
      \ Some sources say his birth was around 1400. If he was born in 1400 and died\
      \ in 1468, that's 68 years old. Alternatively, if he was born in 1398, it's\
      \ 70. Hmm, I need to get this right.\n\nI think the exact birth year is not\
      \ definitively known, but the most commonly accepted year is around 1400. Let's\
      \ check a reliable source. Wait, according to historical records, Johannes Gutenberg\
      \ was born around 1393-1403, but many sources say 1400. His death was February\
      \ 3, 1468. If he was born in 1400, then 1468 minus 1400 is 68. But if he was\
      \ born in 1393, then he would have been 75. However, the exact birth year is\
      \ a bit uncertain. But the consensus is that he was in his mid to late 60s or\
      \ 70s. Wait, maybe I should look up the commonly accepted age. I remember reading\
      \ that he was about 70 when he died. Let's say 70 as an approximate. But I need\
      \ to verify. Let me think again. If he died in 1468 and was born in 1398, that's\
      \ exactly 70. Maybe that's the number. But without exact records, there's some\
      \ uncertainty. However, the key point is that he was definitely older than 56.\
      \ Because even if he was 68, that's older than Jobs' 56. So regardless of the\
      \ exact birth year (as long as it's around 1400), Gutenberg would have been\
      \ in his late 60s or 70s, which is older than 56.\n\nSo Steve Jobs died at 56,\
      \ Gutenberg at least 68 or older. Therefore, yes, Steve Jobs was younger at\
      \ the time of his death than Gutenberg.\n</think>YES  \nSteve Jobs was 56 when\
      \ he died in 2011. Johannes Gutenberg\u2019s exact birth year is debated but\
      \ is generally placed around 1400, and he died in 1468, making him at least\

      whether Steve Jobs was younger when he died compared to Johannes Gutenberg at
      the time of his death. Hmm, I need to figure out their ages when they passed
      away.


      First, I should recall their birth and death years. Steve Jobs, I think he was
      born in 1955. His death was in 2011, right? So if I subtract 1955 from 2011,
      that would be 56 years. Wait, 2011 minus 1955: 1955 + 56 = 2011. Yeah, so he
      was 56 when he died.


      Now, Johannes Gutenberg. He''s the inventor of the printing press. His dates
      might be trickier because he''s from much earlier. Let me think. I believe he
      was born around 1400. Let me check... Oh, right, his exact birth year isn''t
      certain, but it''s commonly cited as around 1400. His death was in 1468, if
      I remember correctly. So if he was born in 1400 and died in 1468, that would
      make him 68 years old. But wait, if the birth year is approximate, maybe like
      1398 to 1400? Suppose he was born in 1398 and died in 1468, that''s 70 years.
      But the standard sources I think say he was born around 1400. So 1468 minus
      1400 is 68. So he was about 68 when he died.


      Comparing the two: Jobs at 56, Gutenberg at 68. So yes, Steve Jobs was younger
      when he died. Therefore, the answer should be YES.

      </think>Steve Jobs was born in 1955 and died in 2011, making him 56 years old
      at his death. Johannes Gutenberg, born around 1400, died in 1468, which would

      is YES.

      \ 2011 minus 1955 is 56 years old. Wait, but he died in October, and his birthday\
      \ is in February, so by October 2011 he would have turned 56 already. So yes,\
      \ 56.\n\nNow Johannes Gutenberg. He's the inventor of the printing press with\
      \ movable type. I need his birth and death years. From what I recall, he was\
      \ from the 15th century. Let's see... I think he was born around 1400. Maybe\
      \ 1398? And he died in 1468? Wait, no, maybe different. Let me think. I remember\
      \ that he died around the time his printing press became influential. The Gutenberg\
      \ Bible was in the 1450s. So he was alive then. His death year is often cited\
      \ as 1468. Birth year... I think 1398. So if he was born in 1398 and died in\
      \ 1468, that would make him 70 years old. Let me confirm that. 1468 minus 1398\
      \ is 70. So that would make Gutenberg 70 at death. \n\nSo comparing the two:\
      \ Steve Jobs was 56, Gutenberg was 70. Therefore, yes, Steve Jobs was younger\
      \ at the time of his death than Johannes Gutenberg was when he died. \n\nWait,\
      \ but wait. Are the dates for Gutenberg accurate? I'm a bit uncertain. Let me\
      \ double-check. Historical records can be a bit fuzzy for people from that era.\
      \ Some sources might say his birth was around 1400. If he was born in 1400 and\
      \ died in 1468, that's 68 years. Hmm, but I think the commonly accepted dates\
      \ are 1398\u20131468, which would be 70 years. I should confirm. For example,\
      \ according to Encyclopaedia Britannica, Gutenberg was born in 1395, 1399, or\
      \ 1406, but died in 1468. Wait, that's conflicting. Oh, no, exact birth year\
      \ is uncertain. That complicates things. Wait, if his birth year is uncertain,\
      \ how can we be sure? The question is assuming a clear answer, though. So perhaps\
      \ the commonly accepted approximate dates. If we take the most frequently cited\
      \ birth year as 1398, then 1468 minus 1398 is 70. Alternatively, if it's 1400,\
      \ then 68. But how does that affect the answer? Steve Jobs was 56. Even if Gutenberg\
      \ was 68, that's still older than 56. So regardless of the exact birth year\
      \ (as long as he was in his late 60s or 70s), Gutenberg was older than Jobs\
      \ at death. Therefore, the answer is YES, Jobs was younger.\n</think>Steve Jobs\
      \ was born on February 24, 1955, and died on October 5, 2011, making him **56\
      \ years old** at his death. Johannes Gutenberg's birth year is commonly approximated\
      \ as 1398, and he died in 1468, placing his age at death around **70 years**\
      \ (even with some uncertainty, estimates generally range between 68\u201370).\
      \ Since 56 is younger than 68\u201370, the answer is:\n\n**YES**"

      \ ages at the time of their deaths, and compare them.\n\nStarting with Rajiv\
      \ Gandhi. I know he was a former Prime Minister of India, so his dates should\
      \ be well-documented. From what I recall, Rajiv Gandhi was born in 1944. Let\
      \ me confirm that. Yes, his birthdate is August 20, 1944. He was assassinated\
      \ in 1991 during an election campaign. The exact date of his death was May 21,\
      \ 1991. So, to calculate his age at death, subtract his birth year from the\
      \ year of death: 1991 - 1944. That would make him 46 years old. But wait, I\
      \ should check the exact months to be precise. He was born in August and died\
      \ in May, so he hadn't turned 47 yet. So he was 46 years, 9 months old approximately.\
      \ But since the question is about being younger, even if it's a matter of months,\
      \ the key is the age in years. So, 46 years old.\n\nNow, Neil Armstrong. He\
      \ was the first man on the moon. His death was more recent. I think he died\
      \ in 2012. Let me verify. Yes, Neil Armstrong passed away on August 25, 2012.\
      \ His birthdate was August 5, 1930. So, calculating his age at death: 2012 minus\
      \ 1930 is 82 years. But again, checking the exact dates: he was born on August\
      \ 5 and died on August 25, so he had already had his birthday that year. So\
      \ he was 82 years and 20 days old when he died. So his age at death was 82.\n\
      \nComparing the two: Rajiv Gandhi was 46, Neil Armstrong was 82. Therefore,\

      \ India. I remember he was assassinated, but I'm not exactly sure about the\
      \ year. Maybe in the early 90s? As for his birth year, I think he was born in\
      \ the mid-1940s. Let me check mentally: Indira Gandhi was his mother, and she\
      \ was Prime Minister in the 60s and 70s, so Rajiv probably became PM after her.\
      \ Maybe he was born around 1944? If he was assassinated in 1991, then his age\
      \ at death would be 1991 minus his birth year.\n\nThen Neil Armstrong, the first\
      \ man on the moon. He was an American astronaut. I know he passed away more\
      \ recently, maybe around 2012? His birth year was 1930, I believe. So if he\
      \ died in 2012, let's do the math: 2012 minus 1930 is 82 years old. Wait, is\
      \ that right? So if Rajiv died in 1991 and was born in 1944, that's 1991-1944=47\
      \ years old. But I need to confirm the exact dates.\n\nWait, maybe I have to\
      \ get the exact birth and death years. Let me think again. Rajiv Gandhi was\
      \ born in 1944, August 20, and he died on May 21, 1991. So from 1944 to 1991,\
      \ that's 47 years. Neil Armstrong was born on August 5, 1930, and died on August\

    8018a52a-6158-40f1-b125-c41d4526da54: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the question is whether Rajiv Gandhi was younger at the time of his death\

      \nNow, Neil Armstrong. He was the first man on the moon, right? He was an American\
      \ astronaut. I think he died more recently. Let me recall. I remember his death\
      \ was in 2012. His birth year was 1930. So if he died in 2012, subtracting 1930\
      \ from 2012 gives his age. 2012 minus 1930 is 82. So Neil Armstrong was 82 when\
      \ he died.\n\nComparing the two, Rajiv Gandhi was 47 and Neil Armstrong was\
      \ 82. So 47 is definitely younger than 82. Therefore, the answer should be YES,\
      \ Rajiv Gandhi was younger at his time of death than Neil Armstrong.\n\nWait,\
      \ let me double-check the dates to be sure. Rajiv Gandhi: born August 20, 1944,\
      \ died May 21, 1991. That would make him 46 years old at death if we count the\
      \ exact months. Wait, because from August 1944 to August 1991 is 47 years, but\
      \ since he died in May, which is before August, he was 46 years and about 9\
      \ months old. Hmm, but usually, when calculating age, we subtract the birth\
      \ year from the death year and adjust if the birthday hadn't occurred yet. So\
      \ if he was born in August 1944 and died in May 1991, he hadn't turned 47 yet.\
      \ So his age would be 46. But sometimes, in general references, they might just\
      \ use the year difference. Let me check that. For example, if someone is born\
      \ in December 1944 and dies in January 1945, they're only a month old. So in\
      \ this case, since May 1991 is before August 1991, he was 46 years old. But\
      \ I think most sources list his age as 46. Wait, conflicting thoughts here.\
      \ Let me confirm. Rajiv Gandhi's exact age at death: 1944 to 1991 is 47 years,\
      \ but if he died before his birthday in August, he was 46. Let me check a reliable\
      \ source. A quick search (in my mind) says he was born on August 20, 1944, and\
      \ died on May 21, 1991. So from August 20, 1944, to August 20, 1990, that's\
      \ 46 years. Then from August 20, 1990, to May 21, 1991, that's about 9 months.\
      \ So he was 46 years and 9 months old. So his age is 46. So maybe the initial\
      \ calculation was wrong. But some sources might round up. Wait, but the question\
      \ is about whether he was younger than Neil Armstrong. Let's check Neil Armstrong's\
      \ exact age. He was born August 5, 1930, and died August 25, 2012. So from August\
      \ 5, 1930, to August 5, 2012, that's 82 years. He died on August 25, which is\
      \ 20 days after his 82nd birthday, so he was 82 years and 20 days old. So his\
      \ age at death was 82. \n\nSo Rajiv was 46, Neil was 82. Therefore, yes, Rajiv\
      \ was younger. But wait, if some sources say Rajiv was 47, that's conflicting.\
      \ Let me check again. If you subtract 1944 from 1991, you get 47, but if the\

      \ So, the question is whether Rajiv Gandhi was younger at his time of death\
      \ than Neil Armstrong when he died. Hmm, okay. I need to figure out the ages\
      \ of both when they passed away and compare them. Let me break it down step\
      \ by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall the birth and death dates of both individuals.\
      \ Let me start with Rajiv Gandhi. I remember he was an Indian Prime Minister,\
      \ right? I think he was assassinated. His mother was Indira Gandhi. From what\
      \ I recall, Rajiv Gandhi was born in 1944, but I'm not 100% sure. His death...\
      \ I think it was in 1991. So if he was born in 1944 and died in 1991, that would\
      \ make him 47 years old at the time of his death. Wait, let me confirm those\
      \ dates. Quick check in my mind: Indira Gandhi was assassinated in 1984, and\
      \ Rajiv became PM after her. Then Rajiv was killed by a suicide bomber in 1991\
      \ during an election campaign. Yeah, that's right. So 1944 to 1991, so 1991\
      \ minus 1944 is 47. Okay, so Rajiv was 47 when he died.\n\nNow, Neil Armstrong.\
      \ He's the first man on the moon. Born in 1930, I believe. And he died more\
      \ recently. Let me think. I think he died in 2012. So if he was born in 1930\
      \ and died in 2012, that would make him 82 years old. Wait, 2012 minus 1930\
      \ is 82. Correct? Yes, because 1930 to 2000 is 70 years, plus 12 more from 2000\
      \ to 2012, so 82 total. So Neil Armstrong was 82 when he died.\n\nNow comparing\
      \ the two: Rajiv Gandhi was 47, and Neil Armstrong was 82. So the question is,\
      \ was Rajiv younger at his death than Armstrong? Yes, 47 is less than 82. Therefore,\
      \ the answer should be YES. But wait, did I get the birth and death dates right?\
      \ Let me double-check quickly. Rajiv Gandhi: born August 20, 1944, died May\
      \ 21, 1991. That's 46 years and about 9 months. Wait, wait, let me calculate\
      \ his exact age. From August 1944 to August 1991 is 47 years. But he died in\
      \ May 1991, which is 3 months before his birthday. So he was 46 years and 9\
      \ months old. But when calculating age, we usually go by the difference in years,\
      \ subtracting birth year from death year, unless the death occurred before the\
      \ birthday. So 1991 minus 1944 is 47, but if he hadn't had his birthday yet\
      \ in 1991, he would be 46. Wait, May 21, 1991: his birthday is August 20. So\
      \ from August 20, 1944, to May 21, 1991. So that's 46 years plus the time between\
      \ August 20, 1990, and May 21, 1991. So that's 9 months and 1 day short of his\
      \ 47th birthday. So technically, he was 46 years old at death. Hmm, but often\
      \ in such contexts, people might state the age as 47 if the death year is after\
      \ the birth month. Wait, but I need to be precise here.\n\nWait, if someone\
      \ is born on August 20, 1944, then on August 20, 1991, they'd turn 47. But Rajiv\
      \ died on May 21, 1991, which is before his birthday. So he was 46 years old,\
      \ 9 months, and 1 day old. So his exact age was 46. So that would make him 46,\
      \ not 47. Wait, but some sources might round up or state it as 47? I need to\
      \ confirm. Let me think. For example, if someone is born in 1944 and dies in\
      \ 1991, the age is death year minus birth year minus 1 if the birthday hasn't\
      \ occurred yet. So 1991-1944=47, but since he hadn't turned 47 yet, it's 46.\
      \ So the correct age is 46.\n\nBut I could be wrong here. Let me think of a\
      \ different example. Suppose someone born December 31, 2000, and dies January\
      \ 1, 2001. Are they 1 year old? No, they're just 1 day old. So the calculation\
      \ is death year minus birth year gives 1, but actual age is 0. So in Rajiv's\
      \ case, 1991-1944=47, but since he died before his August birthday, he was 46.\
      \ So correct age is 46.\n\nNow, Neil Armstrong. He was born on August 5, 1930,\
      \ and died on August 25, 2012. Let's see, so from August 5, 1930, to August\
      \ 5, 2012, is 82 years. He died on August 25, which is 20 days after his 82nd\
      \ birthday. So he was 82 years and 20 days old. So his age at death was 82.\n\
      \nSo Rajiv was 46, Armstrong was 82. So Rajiv was indeed younger at the time\
      \ of his death. Therefore, the answer is YES. But wait, if some sources state\
      \ Rajiv's age as 47, that would be a discrepancy. Let me check. Quick online\
      \ check in my mind: I recall that Rajiv Gandhi was 46 when he died. Because\
      \ 1991-1944 is 47, but he hadn't had his 47th birthday yet. So 46. So yes, 46\
      \ vs. 82. Therefore, YES, Rajiv was younger.\n</think>Rajiv Gandhi was born\
      \ on August 20, 1944, and died on May 21, 1991. Calculating his age at death:\
      \  \n- From August 20, 1944, to May 21, 1991, he was **46 years old** (as he\
      \ died 3 months before turning 47).  \n\nNeil Armstrong was born on August 5,\

      the question is whether Rajiv Gandhi was younger at the time of his death than
      Neil Armstrong was when he died. Hmm. Alright, need to check their birth years

      First, Rajiv Gandhi. I remember he was an Indian Prime Minister. When did he
      die? I think he was assassinated in 1991. Let me confirm. Yes, Rajiv Gandhi
      was born in 1944 and died in 1991. So his age would be 1991 minus 1944. Let
      me do that math: 1991 - 1944 = 47 years old when he died.


      Now, Neil Armstrong. He was the first man on the moon. He died more recently,
      right? I think he passed away in 2012. His birth year was 1930. So 2012 minus
      1930. That''s 82 years old at the time of his death.


      So comparing the two: Rajiv Gandhi was 47, Neil Armstrong was 82. So yes, Rajiv
      was younger at the time of his death than Armstrong. Therefore, the answer should
      be YES.

      </think>Rajiv Gandhi was born in 1944 and died in 1991, making him 47 years
      old at his death. Neil Armstrong was born in 1930 and died in 2012, making him

      First, Arthur Conan Doyle. I remember he's the author of Sherlock Holmes. I\
      \ think he was born in the 19th century. Let me recall... I think he was born\

      \ I'm pretty sure he was born May 22, 1859, and died July 7, 1930. So subtracting\
      \ 1859 from 1930 gives 71 years. Correct. John Paul II: born May 18, 1920, died\
      \ April 2, 2005. So from 1920 to 2005 is 85 years. However, since he died in\
      \ April 2005, his exact age would be 84 years and about 10 months, but we generally\
      \ count the year difference. Wait, but when calculating age, if you die before\
      \ your birthday in the year, you subtract one. For example, someone born in\
      \ May 1920 who dies in April 2005 would be 84 years old because they hadn't\
      \ reached their 85th birthday yet. Wait, that's a mistake if I just subtract\
      \ the years. Let me recalculate.\n\nJohn Paul II's exact age at death: 2005\
      \ minus 1920 is 85, but since he died in April and his birthday is in May, he\
      \ was 84 years and 11 months old. So he would have been 84, not 85. Wait, but\
      \ sometimes sources might round up? Let me check. For example, if someone is\
      \ born in 1920 and dies in 2005, they would have their 85th birthday in 2005\
      \ if they lived past May 18. But he died in April, so he didn't reach 85. Therefore,\
      \ his age would be 84 years old. Wait, but I thought earlier it was 85. Hmm,\
      \ this is a possible error. So I need to verify.\n\nWait, let's compute it step\
      \ by step. 2005 minus 1920 equals 85, but since the death was before his birthday,\
      \ subtract 1 year. So 85 minus 1 is 84. So he was 84. But some sources might\
      \ just take the difference in years, which is 85, but in reality, since the\
      \ birthday hadn't occurred yet, he was 84. I need to confirm which is correct.\n\
      \nLooking up (in my mind) John Paul II's age at death: he was born May 18, 1920,\
      \ died April 2, 2005. So from May 18, 1920, to May 18, 2005, would be exactly\
      \ 85 years. But he died on April 2, which is about a month and a half before\
      \ his birthday. So his exact age is 84 years, 10 months, and some days. Therefore,\
      \ his age at death was 84, not 85. But many sources might state 85 because it's\
      \ the difference in years. Wait, but that's a common mistake. For example, if\
      \ someone is born in 2000 and dies in 2020, but before their birthday, they\
      \ are 19 years old, not 20. So in terms of completed years, it's 84.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ if Doyle died at 71 and John Paul II at 84, then yes, Doyle was younger. But\
      \ if the source says 85, then the answer would still be yes because 71 < 85.\
      \ Wait, so maybe the initial calculation was wrong. Let me check again.\n\n\
      Wait, Arthur Conan Doyle: 1859 to 1930. 1930 -1859: 71 years. Correct. John\
      \ Paul II: if he died at 84, then 71 < 84. If the question is considering the\
      \ year difference, 85, then 71 <85. Either way, the answer is YES. But which\
      \ is the accurate age? Because in reality, he was 84. Let's see. For example,\
      \ 1920 to 2005 is 85 years, but only if you reach the birthday. So actual age\
      \ is 84. But perhaps in historical records, sometimes the age is given as the\
      \ difference in years, ignoring the exact dates. For example, if someone was\
      \ born December 31, 2000, and dies January 1, 2001, they would be considered\
      \ 1 year old in some contexts, even though it's just one day. But biologically,\
      \ they are 0 years old. So this can vary.\n\nIn this case, since the question\
      \ is about historical figures, perhaps it's based on the simple subtraction\
      \ of death year minus birth year, so John Paul II would be 2005 -1920 =85. If\
      \ that's the case, then the answer is yes, because 71 <85. However, if we calculate\
      \ accurately, he was 84. But maybe the answer expects the simple subtraction,\
      \ so the answer would still be YES. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ perhaps I made a mistake and John Paul II's death age is indeed 85. Let me\
      \ check again. If he was born in 1920, then 1920 to 2005 is 85 years. But since\
      \ he didn't live the full 85 years, he was 84. So that would mean the correct\
      \ answer is YES, because 71 (Doyle) is less than 84 (John Paul II). So regardless\
      \ of how you calculate, the answer is yes. Therefore, the answer is YES, Arthur\

      \ his death. His death was in 2005. So when was he born? I recall he was born\
      \ in 1920. Let me confirm that. Yes, John Paul II was born on May 18, 1920,\
      \ and died on April 2, 2005. Calculating his age: 2005 minus 1920 is 85 years.\
      \ Wait, but he died in April, so if his birthday was in May, he would have been\
      \ 84 years old at death, because he hadn't reached his 85th birthday yet. Wait,\
      \ 2005 minus 1920 is 85, but from May 1920 to April 2005 is 84 years and 11\
      \ months, so he was 84 years old when he died. Hmm, maybe I need to double-check\
      \ that. Let's do the exact calculation: 1920 + 85 = 2005. But if he was born\
      \ in May 1920 and died in April 2005, he would be 84 years old, turning 85 in\
      \ May 2005. So his age at death was 84 years and 11 months, which is technically\
      \ 84 years old. So 84 years old. \n\nWait, but sometimes when people calculate\
      \ age, they just subtract the birth year from the death year. So 2005 - 1920\
      \ = 85. But depending on the exact months, it might be a year less. So this\
      \ could be a point of confusion. Let me confirm the exact dates. John Paul II\
      \ was born on May 18, 1920, and died on April 2, 2005. So from May 18, 1920,\
      \ to May 18, 2005, would be exactly 85 years. But he died on April 2, which\
      \ is about a month and a half before his 85th birthday. Therefore, his exact\
      \ age at death was 84 years, 10 months, and however many days. So he was 84\
      \ years old when he died. \n\nTherefore, comparing the two: Arthur Conan Doyle\
      \ died at 71 (if my initial assumption is correct), and John Paul II at 84.\
      \ So Doyle was indeed younger at the time of death than John Paul II. Therefore,\
      \ the answer would be YES. \n\nWait, but wait: let me make sure about Conan\
      \ Doyle's dates. He was born on May 22, 1859, and died on July 7, 1930. Let\
      \ me calculate his exact age. 1930 minus 1859 is 71 years. But from May 22,\
      \ 1859, to July 7, 1930: so he was 71 years old, and had already had his birthday\
      \ in May, so 71 years and about a month and a half. So yes, 71 years old. \n\
      \nTherefore, 71 versus 84. So YES, Arthur Conan Doyle was younger at his death\
      \ than John Paul II was at his death.\n</think>Arthur Conan Doyle was born on\
      \ May 22, 1859, and died on July 7, 1930, making him 71 years old at the time\
      \ of his death. Pope John Paul II was born on May 18, 1920, and died on April\
      \ 2, 2005; he was 84 years old at the time of his death. Since 71 is less than\
      \ 84, **YES**, Arthur Conan Doyle was younger at his time of death than John\
      \ Paul II. \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    b3166461-f17a-46f8-abf5-ff75011c9aba: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ I need to figure out if Arthur Conan Doyle was younger at the time of his\
      \ death than Pope John Paul II was when he died. \n\nFirst, I should recall\
      \ their birth and death years. Let's start with Arthur Conan Doyle. I remember\
      \ he's the author of Sherlock Holmes. If I'm not mistaken, he was born in 1859.\
      \ For his death year, I think he died around 1930. Let me confirm that. Yes,\
      \ I think he was born on May 22, 1859, and died on July 7, 1930. So, calculating\
      \ his age at death: 1930 minus 1859. Let's do that. 1859 + 70 years would be\
      \ 1929, so he was 71 years old when he died (since 1930 - 1859 = 71).\n\nNow,\
      \ Pope John Paul II. His death was more recent. He was pope for a long time.\
      \ His birth year... I think he was born in 1920. Let me check in my mind. Pope\
      \ John Paul II's original name was Karol Wojty\u0142a. He became pope in 1978\
      \ and served until his death in 2005. So, he was born on May 18, 1920, and died\
      \ on April 2, 2005. To calculate his age at death: 2005 minus 1920. That would\
      \ be 85 years. But wait, since his birthday is in May and he died in April,\
      \ he hadn't turned 85 yet. So 2005 - 1920 = 85, but subtracting the months,\
      \ he was 84 years and about 10 months old. Wait, but when calculating age, if\
      \ you haven't had your birthday in the year of death, you subtract one. So 2005\
      \ - 1920 = 85, minus 1 because he died before his birthday in May. So 84 years\
      \ old. Hmm, I might be mixing up the exact dates. Wait, his date of birth is\
      \ May 18, 1920, and death is April 2, 2005. So from May 18, 1920, to May 18,\
      \ 2004, he would be 84. Then from May 18, 2004, to April 2, 2005, that's 10\
      \ months and a couple weeks. So he hadn't reached 85 yet. Therefore, his age\
      \ at death was 84 years old. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the calculation is\
      \ 2005 - 1920 = 85, but because the birthday hadn't occurred yet, he was 84.\
      \ So it's 84 years old. However, some sources might say 85. Wait, maybe I should\
      \ verify. Let's see: 2005 minus 1920 equals 85, but he died in April, so he\
      \ was 84 years and 10 months. Therefore, his age would be 84. So, John Paul\
      \ II was 84 when he died. \n\nNow, comparing the two. Conan Doyle was 71, John\
      \ Paul II was 84. So Conan Doyle was younger at the time of his death. Therefore,\
      \ the answer is YES, because 71 is less than 84. \n\nWait, but wait another\
      \ thing. Am I sure about their ages? Let me double-check. For Conan Doyle: 1859\
      \ to 1930. 1930 - 1859 = 71. Yes. For John Paul II: 2005 - 1920. If we calculate\
      \ the exact age, from May 18, 1920, to April 2, 2005: subtract 1920 from 2005,\
      \ which is 85, but since he died before his 85th birthday, it's 84 years. So\
      \ 84. Therefore, 71 vs 84. So the answer is YES.\n</think>Arthur Conan Doyle\
      \ was born in 1859 and died in 1930, making him 71 years old at the time of\
      \ his death. Pope John Paul II (Karol Wojty\u0142a) was born in 1920 and died\
      \ in 2005. Despite the 85-year difference between 1920 and 2005, he died in\
      \ April 2005, a month before his 85th birthday, so he was 84 years old. Since\
      \ 71 is less than 84, the answer is YES.\n\n**Answer: YES**"
    b5d0e0bd-207d-4bfc-8395-a84f12ad41e4: "<think>Alright, let me try to figure this\
      \ out. The question is whether Arthur Conan Doyle was younger at the time of\

      \ the author of Sherlock Holmes. From what I recall, he was born in 1859. Let\
      \ me confirm that... Yes, Arthur Conan Doyle was born on May 22, 1859. When\
      \ did he die? I think he died in 1930. Checking... Yes, he passed away on July\
      \ 7, 1930. So, to calculate his age at death: 1930 minus 1859. Let's do the\
      \ math. 1930 - 1859 = 71 years. So he was 71 when he died.\n\nNow, Pope John\
      \ Paul II. His birth year was 1920, I believe. His name before becoming Pope\
      \ was Karol Wojty\u0142a. He was born on May 18, 1920. He became Pope in 1978\
      \ and served until his death in 2005. So he died on April 2, 2005. Calculating\
      \ his age: 2005 minus 1920. That's 85 years. Wait, but let me make sure. From\
      \ May 18, 1920, to April 2, 2005, that's just shy of his 85th birthday, but\
      \ since the birthday is in May and he died in April, he was actually 84 years\
      \ old when he died, not 85 yet. Hmm, is that right? Wait, if he was born in\
      \ 1920, then in 2005, 2005 - 1920 = 85, but since he died before his birthday\
      \ in May, he was 84 years old. Because his 85th birthday would have been in\
      \ May 2005, but he died in April. So his age at death was 84. Wait, but sometimes\
      \ people might count differently. Let me confirm. For example, if someone is\
      \ born on May 18, 1920, then on May 18, 1921, they turn 1. So by April 2, 2005,\
      \ they haven't had their birthday yet in 2005, so their age would be 84 years\
      \ old, not 85. So John Paul II was 84 when he died.\n\nBut wait, I've heard\
      \ conflicting information. Some sources might say 85. Let me check. Quick, reliable\
      \ sources say Pope John Paul II was born May 18, 1920, died April 2, 2005. So,\
      \ subtracting 1920 from 2005 gives 85, but because he died before his birthday,\
      \ he was 84 years old. So the correct age is 84. Wait, no\u2014if you subtract\
      \ 1920 from 2005, you get 85, but age is counted based on completed years. So\
      \ from May 18, 1920, to May 18, 2005, that's 85 years. But he died on April\
      \ 2, 2005, which is about 1.5 months before his 85th birthday. So he hadn't\
      \ reached 85 yet. Therefore, his age at death was 84 years. But sometimes, in\
      \ some contexts, people might just subtract the years and say 85. But according\
      \ to proper calculation, it's 84. However, I should verify this. Let me think:\
      \ For example, if someone was born in 2000 and died in 2024 before their birthday,\
      \ they are 23 years old, not 24. So same here: 1920 to 2005 is 85 years, but\
      \ since the birthday hadn't occurred yet, he's 84. So the age is 84.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ Arthur Conan Doyle died at 71, John Paul II at 84. So the question is: Was\
      \ Doyle younger at death than John Paul II? Yes, 71 is younger than 84. Therefore,\
      \ the answer is YES.\n</think>Arthur Conan Doyle was born in 1859 and died in\
      \ 1930, making him **71** at the time of his death. Pope John Paul II was born\

      \ step by step. The question is asking whether Ali ibn Abi Talib was younger\

      \ need to find out the birth and death years of both individuals, calculate\
      \ their ages at death, and then compare them.\n\nStarting with Ali ibn Abi Talib.\
      \ I know he's a significant figure in Islam, the cousin and son-in-law of the\
      \ Prophet Muhammad. From what I remember, he was the fourth caliph in Sunni\
      \ Islam and the first Imam in Shia Islam. His death is a major event, as he\
      \ was assassinated. I think he died in the 7th century. Let me recall... I believe\
      \ he was born around 600 CE. His death is often cited as 661 CE. If he was born\
      \ in 600 and died in 661, that would make him about 61 years old at the time\
      \ of his death. Wait, but I should double-check these dates because sometimes\
      \ historical figures, especially from that era, might have some discrepancies\
      \ in their exact birth years. Some sources might say he was born in 599 or 601.\
      \ Let me confirm quickly. Okay, according to most sources, Ali was born around\
      \ 600 CE and died in 661 CE, so 61 years old.\n\nNow, Jimmy Carter. He's a former\
      \ U.S. President, still alive as of 2023. Wait, the question is about their\
      \ ages at their time of death. But Jimmy Carter is still alive. Wait, the question\
      \ might be a bit tricky here. If Jimmy Carter is still alive, then the time\
      \ of his death hasn't occurred yet. But the way the question is phrased: \"\
      Was Ali ibn Abi Talib younger at their time of death than Jimmy Carter at their\
      \ time of death?\" So it's comparing the age each was when they died. But since\
      \ Carter is still alive, we can't know his exact age at death. Hmm, maybe the\
      \ question assumes that Carter's current age is the age at death, but that's\
      \ not correct because he's still living. Wait, but perhaps the question was\
      \ written at a time when Carter was still alive, but maybe he has since passed\
      \ away. Wait, as of October 2023, Jimmy Carter is still alive at 99 years old.\
      \ But if the question was posed after his death, then we'd use that age. But\
      \ since the user is asking now, and Carter is alive, the question might have\
      \ a mistake. However, maybe the intended answer is to use the current age of\
      \ Carter as if it's his death age, but that's speculative. Alternatively, perhaps\
      \ the question assumes hypothetical ages. Wait, no\u2014the question says \"\
      at their time of death,\" so for Ali, it's when he died, and for Carter, it's\
      \ when he will die. But since we can't know the future, perhaps the question\
      \ is based on the assumption that the answer is based on known data up to now.\
      \ But that seems problematic because Carter's age at death isn't known yet.\
      \ Wait, but maybe the question was framed in a past context where Carter had\
      \ already died. Let me check when the question was written. The user hasn't\
      \ specified a date, but given that Carter is a recent figure, maybe the question\
      \ assumes current knowledge. Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo\
      \ and refers to another Carter? No, Jimmy Carter is the only prominent one.\
      \ Wait, maybe the user is using \"their\" incorrectly, but the question is about\
      \ the two individuals: Ali at his death vs. Carter at his death. Since Carter\
      \ is still alive, we can't give a definitive answer. But perhaps the answer\
      \ is based on the assumption that Carter's current age is higher than Ali's\
      \ age at death. Let me see: Ali died at 61, and Carter is currently 99 (as of\
      \ October 2023). If Carter were to die today, he'd be 99, which is much older\
      \ than 61. Therefore, yes, Ali was younger at his death than Carter is now,\
      \ and even if Carter dies in the future, unless he somehow lives to be older\

    27adc175-f0ad-4522-9f80-eea286b0d9ff: "<think>Okay, so the question is whether\
      \ Ali ibn Abi Talib was younger at his time of death than Jimmy Carter was at\
      \ his time of death. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need\
      \ to figure out the birth and death years for both individuals. Let's start\
      \ with Ali ibn Abi Talib. From what I remember, he was a significant figure\
      \ in early Islam, the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad. His death\
      \ is a major event in Islamic history. I think he was assassinated, maybe around\
      \ 661 CE. As for his birth year, he was born in Mecca, probably around 600 CE.\
      \ Wait, but I need exact dates. Let me check my memory. Ali was born around\
      \ 600 CE, maybe 599 or 601. The exact date might not be precise, but historians\
      \ estimate his birth around 599-601 CE. His death was in 661 CE. So if he was\
      \ born in 599, that would make him 62 years old at death (661-599=62). But if\
      \ it's 601, then 60 years old. Hmm, so there's a range there. \n\nNow, Jimmy\
      \ Carter. He's a former U.S. president, still alive as of 2023. Wait, but the\
      \ question is about his age at his time of death. But Jimmy Carter hasn't died\
      \ yet. Wait, the question says \"at their time of death.\" Wait, that's tricky.\
      \ The question is phrased as \"Was Al\u012B ibn Ab\u012B \u1E6C\u0101lib younger\
      \ at their time of death than Jimmy Carter at their time of death?\" So, if\
      \ Jimmy Carter is still alive, how do we answer? Because we can't know his age\
      \ at death yet. But perhaps the question assumes a hypothetical scenario, or\
      \ maybe it's a trick question. Wait, maybe the question was written before Carter's\
      \ death, but he's still alive. Wait, as of October 2023, Jimmy Carter is still\
      \ alive at 99 years old. So if we consider that, then when he dies, he will\
      \ be older than 99. But since he's not dead yet, his age at death is not known.\
      \ Therefore, the answer would be uncertain unless there's a different interpretation.\
      \ Wait, but maybe the question is based on known data at the time the question\
      \ was formulated. Wait, perhaps the answer assumes that Jimmy Carter's current\
      \ age is his age at death if the question is recent. But that's not how it works.\
      \ The question is about their age at the time of their death. Since Carter is\
      \ still alive, we can't definitively answer unless we use his current age as\
      \ a lower bound. But the question seems to want a YES/NO answer based on available\
      \ information. Maybe the intended answer is based on the fact that Ali died\
      \ at around 60-63, and Carter is already 99, so even if Carter died today, he's\
      \ older. So the answer would be YES, Ali was younger at his death than Carter.\
      \ But I need to confirm the exact numbers.\n\nLet me double-check Ali's dates.\
      \ According to historical records, Ali ibn Abi Talib was born around 600 CE\
      \ (some sources say 15 September 601 CE) and died on 21 Ramadan 40 AH, which\
      \ corresponds to 28 January 661 CE. So if he was born in 601, he would have\
      \ been 59 or 60 years old at death (depending on the exact birth and death dates).\
      \ But sometimes sources mention his age as 63, which might be according to the\
      \ Islamic lunar calendar. However, using the Gregorian calendar, it's around\
      \ 60-61. Let's take 60 as a safe estimate. Jimmy Carter was born on October\
      \ 1, 1924. As of 2023, he is 99 years old. If he were to die today, he'd be\
      \ 99. But since he's still alive, technically his age at death is unknown, but\
      \ unless he lives longer, but even if he died now, he's 99, which is older than\
      \ Ali's approximate 60. Therefore, the answer is YES, Ali was younger at death\
      \ than Carter is at his death (assuming Carter's current age is the age at death\
      \ if the question is posed now). \n\nBut wait, the question is phrased in the\
      \ past tense: \"Was Ali... younger... than Jimmy Carter at their time of death.\"\
      \ Since Carter hasn't died yet, perhaps the question is flawed. However, if\
      \ we consider the fact that Carter is still alive and his current age is beyond\
      \ Ali's age at death, then the answer is YES. Even if he lives longer, the answer\
      \ would still hold because he's already older. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n\
      </think>Ali ibn Ab\u012B \u1E6C\u0101lib is historically recorded to have died\
      \ around 661 CE at approximately 60-63 years old, based on his birthdate around\
      \ 599-601 CE. Jimmy Carter, born on October 1, 1924, is still alive as of 2023\
      \ at 99 years old. Since Carter's current age (99) already exceeds Ali's age\
      \ at death, even if Carter were to pass away now, he would be older. \n\n**ANSWER:\
      \ YES**"
    2fb44d55-4c2f-419a-8a49-c10b715bceae: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure this out.\
      \ The question is whether Ali ibn Abi Talib was younger at his time of death\
      \ than Jimmy Carter was when he died. I need to compare their ages at death.\
      \ \n\nFirst, I should find out when Ali was born and when he died. From what\
      \ I remember, Ali was the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, and\
      \ he was the fourth caliph in Sunni Islam and the first Imam in Shia Islam.\
      \ He was assassinated, I think in the 7th century. Let me check the dates: Ali\
      \ was born around 600 CE, maybe 599 or 601. His death was in 661 CE. If he was\
      \ born around 600, then his age at death would be approximately 60 or 61 years\
      \ old. Wait, maybe more precisely, some sources say he was born in 599 and died\
      \ in 661, so that would be 62 years old. But I might need to confirm that.\n\
      \nNow, Jimmy Carter, the former U.S. President, is still alive as of 2023. Wait,\
      \ but the question is about their ages at their time of death. So Jimmy Carter\
      \ hasn't died yet. Wait, that's a problem. The question is phrased as \"Was\
      \ Ali ibn Abi Talib younger at their time of death than Jimmy Carter at their\
      \ time of death?\" But if Jimmy Carter is still alive, then his age at death\
      \ isn't known yet. However, maybe the question is hypothetical, assuming both\
      \ have died, but that's unclear. Wait, perhaps the question was written when\
      \ Carter was still alive, but if it's current, he's still alive. Wait, I need\
      \ to check.\n\nWait, Jimmy Carter was born in 1924. As of 2023, he is 99 years\
      \ old. He is still alive. So, if the question is current, then Carter hasn't\
      \ died yet, so his age at death is not determined. But the question must be\
      \ assuming the current age as his age at death, but that's not accurate. Wait,\
      \ maybe the question is old, from a time when Carter was alive, but the user\
      \ is asking now. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. But perhaps the intended comparison\
      \ is between Ali's age at death (which is known) and Jimmy Carter's current\
      \ age, but the question specifically says \"at their time of death.\" Therefore,\
      \ this is a trick question because Carter hasn't died yet. But maybe the answer\
      \ is that since Carter is still alive and older than 60, even if he died today,\
      \ he would be older than Ali was when he died. So let's proceed with the information.\n\
      \nAssuming Ali died at around 61 years old (if he was born in 599 and died in\
      \ 661, that's 62 years), and Carter is currently 99. If Carter were to die today,\
      \ he's already 99, so he would be older. Therefore, yes, Ali was younger at\
      \ his time of death than Carter is now. But the question is about their ages\
      \ at their time of death. Since Carter's time of death hasn't occurred, but\
      \ assuming the question is posed in a way that allows using Carter's current\
      \ age as a hypothetical age at death, then the answer would be yes. However,\
      \ technically, since the question is about their time of death, and Carter hasn't\
      \ died yet, perhaps the answer is indeterminate. But maybe the user expects\
      \ us to proceed with known data up to now. Let me double-check Ali's exact age.\
      \ \n\nLooking up Ali ibn Abi Talib's dates: according to historical records,\
      \ he was born on March 17, 599 CE, and died on January 28, 661 CE. That makes\
      \ his age at death 61 years and 10 months approximately. Jimmy Carter was born\
      \ on October 1, 1924, and as of October 2023, he is 99 years old. Since he's\
      \ still alive, his age at death isn't known, but if he were to die today, he's\
      \ 99. Therefore, since 99 is greater than 61, the answer would be YES, Ali was\
      \ younger at his death than Carter is now, and if Carter dies in the future,\
      \ he will be older than Ali was. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>Ali\
      \ ibn Ab\u012B \u1E6C\u0101lib died at approximately 61\u201362 years old (born\
      \ 599 CE, died 661 CE). Jimmy Carter, born in 1924, is currently 99 years old\
      \ (as of 2023) and is still alive. Since Carter's age at death will necessarily\
      \ be higher than his current age (if he lives longer) or exactly his current\

      \nFirst, I should start by recalling some basic facts. Ali ibn Abi Talib was\
      \ a significant figure in Islamic history, the cousin and son-in-law of the\
      \ Prophet Muhammad. He became the fourth caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate. From\
      \ what I remember, he was assassinated in 661 CE. Now, his birth year\u2014\
      I think he was born around 600 CE, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe around 599\
      \ or 600? Let me check. Wait, I recall that he was born in 599 CE. So if he\
      \ died in 661, that would make him around 61 or 62 years old at the time of\
      \ death. Hmm, but I need to confirm that.\n\nNow, Jimmy Carter is a former U.S.\
      \ President, still alive as of 2023. Wait, the question is about the time of\
      \ his death. But Jimmy Carter is still alive. Wait, the question is phrased\
      \ as \"at their time of death.\" So, if the question is whether Ali was younger\
      \ when he died than Jimmy Carter was when he died, but since Carter is still\
      \ alive, maybe the question is hypothetical? Wait, no\u2014the question must\
      \ have a clear YES or NO answer, so perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\
      \ Wait, maybe the question refers to their ages at the time of their respective\
      \ deaths. Since Ali is already deceased, and Carter is still alive, but the\
      \ question is about their ages at their time of death. But Carter hasn't died\
      \ yet. Wait, that might be a problem. Unless the question assumes that Carter's\
      \ current age is the age he's going to be when he dies. But that's not possible\
      \ because we can't know when he'll die. Wait, maybe the question was written\
      \ before Carter's death, but as of now (October 2023), Jimmy Carter is still\
      \ alive at 99 years old. So the question might have intended to compare their\
      \ ages at the time of death, but since Carter is still alive, how can we answer?\
      \ Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the question is\
      \ from a time when Carter had already passed away, but that's not the case.\
      \ Hmm, this is confusing. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is based on the assumption\
      \ that Carter is deceased. Let me check the facts again. Jimmy Carter was born\
      \ on October 1, 1924. As of now, October 2023, he is 99 years old and still\
      \ alive. So if the question is asking whether Ali was younger when he died than\
      \ Carter was when he died, but since Carter hasn't died yet, the answer would\
      \ require knowing Carter's age at death, which is unknown. But the question\
      \ must have a YES/NO answer, so maybe the intended answer is based on the current\
      \ age of Carter. Wait, but the question specifies \"at their time of death,\"\
      \ so if Carter is still alive, his age at death isn't known. Therefore, the\
      \ question might be flawed. However, given that Ali died at around 61-63, and\
      \ Carter is already 99, the answer would be YES, Ali was younger at his death\
      \ than Carter's current age, but that's not exactly the question. Wait, the\
      \ question is about Carter's age at death. Since he's 99 and still alive, if\
      \ he were to die today, he's 99. But the question is phrased in the past tense\
      \ for both. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the question. Alternatively, perhaps\
      \ the question assumes Carter's death age as his current age. But that's not\
      \ accurate. Alternatively, maybe the question intended to compare someone else.\
      \ Wait, no. Let me double-check the birth and death dates for Ali ibn Abi Talib.\
      \ \n\nAli was born in 599 CE and died in 661 CE, so that's 661 - 599 = 62 years\
      \ old. Jimmy Carter was born in 1924. If he were to die in, say, 2023, he'd\
      \ be 99. But since he's still alive, his age at death isn't determined. However,\
      \ the question is phrased as \"at their time of death,\" so unless the question\
      \ is from a future perspective where Carter has passed away, but that's not\
      \ possible. Therefore, the question might have a mistake. But given that the\
      \ user is asking now, and Carter is still alive, perhaps the answer is based\
      \ on the assumption that Carter's current age is his age at death, which is\
      \ 99, so Ali died at 62, so YES, he was younger. Alternatively, maybe the question\
      \ intended to use a different person who is already deceased. Wait, but the\
      \ question specifically mentions Jimmy Carter. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe\
      \ there's a miscalculation on Ali's age. Let me confirm. Ali ibn Abi Talib is\
      \ believed to have been born around 600 CE. He died in 661 CE. So 661 - 600\
      \ = 61. But some sources say 599 CE, making him 62. Either way, early 60s. Jimmy\
      \ Carter is 99. So even if Carter were to die today, he's 99. So Ali was younger\
      \ when he died. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>Ali ibn Ab\u012B \u1E6C\
      \u0101lib was born around 599\u2013600 CE and died in 661 CE, making him approximately\
      \ 61\u201362 years old at his death. Jimmy Carter, born in 1924, is still alive\
      \ as of 2023 at 99 years old. Since the question compares their ages \"at their\
      \ time of death,\" and Carter\u2019s current age (99) exceeds Ali\u2019s age\
      \ at death, the answer is **YES** \u2014 assuming the question implies Carter\u2019\
      s eventual death age will be at least his current age. \n\n**ANSWER: YES**"

      \ I think he was the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad. From what\
      \ I remember, he was the fourth caliph and his death was around the 7th century.\
      \ He was assassinated, I believe. As for his birth and death dates, I'm a bit\
      \ fuzzy. Let me think. The Islamic calendar starts in 622 CE with the Hijra.\
      \ Ali was born before that, maybe around 600 CE. His death was in 661 CE, if\

      \ be based on known data. Wait, this is confusing. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps\
      \ the question is phrased correctly. Let me re-read: \"Was Al\u012B ibn Ab\u012B\
      \ \u1E6C\u0101lib younger at their time of death than Jimmy Carter at their\
      \ time of death?\" So both are being compared based on their ages when they\
      \ died. Since Jimmy Carter is still alive, his age at death isn't known, but\
      \ maybe the question assumes that he has already died, or perhaps it's a trick\
      \ question. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to work\
      \ with the information available.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is\
      \ from a time when Carter had already passed away, but in reality, he's still\
      \ alive. So perhaps the answer is based on the current age of Carter, but since\
      \ he's alive, his age at death is not yet determined. Therefore, the question\
      \ might be flawed. But maybe the intended answer is to use Ali's age at death\
      \ (around 61) and compare it to Jimmy Carter's current age (as of 2023, he's\
      \ 99 years old, born in 1924). So if the question is phrased as \"at their time\
      \ of death,\" but Carter hasn't died yet, then technically, we can't compare.\
      \ However, if we proceed under the assumption that the question is asking whether\
      \ Ali was younger when he died than Carter's current age, then the answer would\
      \ be yes, because 61 is less than 99. But that's not exactly what the question\
      \ is asking. The question is about their ages at their respective times of death.\

      \ cited as 13th Rajab, 21 BH (Before Hijra), which would correspond to around\
      \ 599 or 600 CE. He died in 40 AH (661 CE) at the age of 60 or 61. So approximately\
      \ 60-61 years old at death.\n\nJimmy Carter was born on October 1, 1924. As\
      \ of October 2023, he is 99 years old and still alive. Therefore, his age at\
      \ death is not yet known, but if he were to die today, he would be 99. However,\
      \ since the question is about their ages at the time of their respective deaths,\
      \ and Carter hasn't died yet, the question is technically unanswerable. But\
      \ given that the user is asking for a YES or NO answer, perhaps the intended\
      \ comparison is between Ali's age at death (61) and Carter's current age (99),\
      \ leading to YES, Ali was younger. But strictly speaking, the question is flawed\
      \ because Carter's age at death is unknown. However, considering that the user\
      \ wants an answer, the most logical approach is to proceed under the assumption\
      \ that the question intends to compare Ali's age at death (61) to Carter's current\
      \ age (99), hence YES. Alternatively, if the question assumes that Carter has\
      \ already died, but that's not the case. Therefore, the answer is YES, because\
      \ 61 is younger than 99, even though Carter is still alive. But this is a bit\
      \ of a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and meant another\

      \ in 661 CE. His birth year is a bit trickier. I think he was born around 599\
      \ or 600 CE. If he died in 661, then subtracting his birth year, that would\
      \ make him about 61 or 62 years old when he died. But I should check that again\
      \ because sometimes historical figures' exact birth years aren't certain. Let\
      \ me verify: sources say he was born around 600 CE and died in 661, so approximately\
      \ 61 years old.\n\nNow, Jimmy Carter. He's a former U.S. president, still alive\
      \ as of 2023. Wait, the question is about their ages at the time of their death.\
      \ But Jimmy Carter is still alive. Oh, but the question might be using the current\
      \ date to calculate his current age, assuming \"at their time of death\" for\
      \ Ali (since he's deceased) and for Carter, maybe hypothetically if he were\
      \ to die now. Wait, but the question says \"at their time of death,\" so if\
      \ Carter is still alive, does that mean we need to consider his current age\
      \ as if he died today? Or is there a mistake here? Because the question is phrased\
      \ in past tense for both: \"their time of death.\" But Jimmy Carter hasn't died\
      \ yet. Hmm. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, perhaps the question\
      \ assumes both have already died? But Carter is alive. So perhaps the intended\
      \ comparison is Ali's age at death versus Carter's current age. Let me check.\n\
      \nWait, the original question: \"Was Al\u012B ibn Ab\u012B \u1E6C\u0101lib younger\
      \ at their time of death than Jimmy Carter at their time of death?\" So both\
      \ \"their\" refers to each person's own time of death. Since Ali is deceased,\
      \ his age at death is known. Jimmy Carter is still alive, so his age at death\
      \ isn't known yet. Therefore, maybe the question is flawed. But perhaps the\
      \ intent is to compare Ali's age at death (around 61) to Jimmy Carter's current\
      \ age. Because if Carter is still alive, his age at death is not determined.\
      \ However, since the question is framed as a historical fact, perhaps there's\
      \ a mistake, and they assume Carter's age at death as his current age, or maybe\
      \ the user is under the impression that Carter has already died. Alternatively,\
      \ maybe the question is from a past time when Carter was still alive, but I\
      \ think Carter is still alive as of October 2023. So perhaps the answer is that\
      \ since Carter hasn't died yet, the comparison isn't possible. But the question\
      \ expects a YES or NO answer, so maybe the intended answer is based on the fact\
      \ that Carter is currently 98 or 99 years old (born 1924), so if he were to\
      \ die now, he'd be older than Ali was at his death. Therefore, YES, Ali was\
      \ younger at death than Carter is now. But since the question is about \"at\
      \ their time of death,\" which for Carter hasn't happened, maybe the answer\
      \ is indeterminate. However, given the question's phrasing, perhaps the user\
      \ expects comparing Ali's age at death (61) to Carter's current age, which is\
      \ around 99, thus Ali was younger. So the answer is YES.\n</think>Ali ibn Ab\u012B\
      \ \u1E6C\u0101lib died in 661 CE at approximately 61 years old. Jimmy Carter,\
      \ born in 1924, is still alive as of 2023, making him 99 years old. Since Carter\
      \ has not yet died, his age at death remains unknown. However, if the question\
      \ assumes Carter's current age as a hypothetical \"time of death\" comparison,\
      \ Ali was indeed younger when he died than Carter's current age. \n\nANSWER:\

      \ He was assassinated on June 28, 1914. To find his age at death, subtract 1863\
      \ from 1914. That gives 51 years. But wait, his birthday is December, so in\
      \ June 1914, he hadn't turned 51 yet. Wait, 1914 minus 1863 is 51, but since\
      \ he died in June and his birthday is in December, he was 50 years old when\
      \ he died. Let me confirm that: 1914 - 1863 = 51, but if he was born in December\
      \ 1863, then in June 1914, he would have been 50 years and 6 months old, right?\
      \ So 50 years old at the time of death.\n\nNow, Johnny Cash. He's a famous American\

      \ the months. He was born in February 1932, and died in September 2003. So by\
      \ September 2003, he had already had his birthday in February, so he was 71\
      \ years old.\n\nSo Franz Ferdinand was 50, and Johnny Cash was 71. Therefore,\

    48a92d3c-2ef4-4e04-b517-80e8f662a8a1: '<think>Okay, let''s see. I need to figure
      out if James Cook was younger when he died compared to Abraham Lincoln when
      he died. Hmm. Both are historical figures, so I should start by finding out
      their birth and death years first, then calculate their ages at death.


      First, James Cook. I remember he was a British explorer, right? I think he died
      in Hawaii. Let me recall. He was killed in 1779 during his third voyage. So
      his death year is 1779. Now, when was he born? Let me think. I think he was
      born in 1728. So if he died in 1779, subtracting 1728 from 1779 gives... 1779
      minus 1728. Let me calculate that. 1779 minus 1700 is 79, then minus 28 more
      is 51. So Cook was 51 years old when he died.


      Now, Abraham Lincoln. He was the US president assassinated in 1865. His birth
      year was 1809. So his age at death would be 1865 minus 1809. Let''s do the math.
      1865 minus 1800 is 65, then minus 9 is 56. Wait, no. Wait, 1809 to 1865: 1865
      minus 1809. Let''s break it down. 1809 to 1859 is 50 years, then from 1859 to
      1865 is 6 years, so total 56? Wait, 1809 + 56 = 1865? Let me check. 1809 + 50
      is 1859, plus 6 is 1865. Yes. So Lincoln was 56 when he died.


      So James Cook died at 51, Lincoln at 56. Therefore, yes, Cook was younger when
      he died. So the answer should be YES.

      \ right? Because he would have turned 51 in October 1779, but he died in February.\
      \ So his age at death was 50 years, 3 months, and some days. So approximately\

      \ States, assassinated in 1865. His birth year was 1809. So, 1865 minus 1809\

      \ I think he was born in 1728 and died in 1779. Wait, yes, he was killed in\
      \ Hawaii in 1779 during his third voyage. So his lifespan would be from 1728\
      \ to 1779. Let me calculate his age at death: 1779 minus 1728. That's 51 years\
      \ old.\n\nNow, Abraham Lincoln. He was the 16th President of the United States,\
      \ right? Assassinated in 1865. His birth year... wasn't he born in 1809? So\
      \ if he died in 1865, subtracting 1809 from 1865 gives 56 years. Wait, 1865\
      \ minus 1809. Let me check that again. 1809 + 56 = 1865. Yes, that's correct.\
      \ So Lincoln was 56 when he died.\n\nComparing the two ages: Cook was 51, Lincoln\
      \ was 56. So the question is, was Cook younger at his death than Lincoln? Since\

      \ died February 14, 1779. If he was born in 1728, subtracting that from 1779\

      \ So when he died in February 1779, he hadn't reached his birthday that year\

      \ we're counting the years, it's still 51 years because the difference is 1779\
      \ - 1728 = 51. Wait, but actually, if his birthday was in October and he died\
      \ in February, he was 50 years old, because he hadn't turned 51 yet. Hmm, that\
      \ might be a mistake here. Let's clarify. If you're born in 1728, in 1778 you'd\
      \ be 50 years old. Then in 1779, before your birthday, you're still 50. So if\
      \ he died in February 1779, he was 50 years old, not 51. Oh no, maybe I miscalculated\
      \ earlier.\n\nLet's do exact calculation: 1779 minus 1728 is 51, but if the\
      \ death date is before the birthday, you subtract one year. So Cook was born\
      \ in 1728, died 1779. The exact age would be 1779 - 1728 = 51, but if he died\
      \ before his birthday, it's 50. So October 27, 1728 to February 14, 1779: that's\
      \ 50 years and a few months. So his age at death is 50. While Abraham Lincoln,\
      \ born February 12, 1809, died April 15, 1865. His birthday is in February,\
      \ and he died in April. So 1865 - 1809 = 56, and since April comes after February,\
      \ he had already turned 56 that year. So he was 56 years old. \n\nWait, but\
      \ Cook's exact age: 50 years, 3 months, and some days. So 50 years old. Therefore,\
      \ Cook was 50, Lincoln was 56. Therefore, the answer is YES, Cook was younger\
      \ at the time of his death than Lincoln was when he died. But wait, the initial\
      \ subtraction of 1779-1728 is 51, but considering the birth and death dates,\
      \ he was 50. So this is a common mistake when calculating ages. So I need to\
      \ verify the exact ages. \n\nI think I need to check a reliable source. From\
      \ what I recall, most sources state James Cook's age at death as 50. For example,\
      \ born 1728, died in 1779 at age 50. Abraham Lincoln was 56. So the correct\
      \ answer would be YES. Therefore, the final answer is YES because 50 is younger\
      \ than 56.\n</think>James Cook was born on October 27, 1728, and died on February\
      \ 14, 1779. Calculating his exact age at death: since he died in February before\
      \ his October birthday, he was 50 years old. Abraham Lincoln was born on February\
      \ 12, 1809, and died on April 15, 1865. He had already celebrated his birthday\
      \ in April, making him 56 years old. \n\n**ANSWER: YES**"

      \ So, the question is: Was Judy Garland younger at her time of death than Leonardo\
      \ da Vinci at his time of death? I need to figure out the ages of both when\
      \ they died and compare them. \n\nFirst, I should recall their birth and death\
      \ years. Let's start with Leonardo da Vinci. From what I remember, he was a\
      \ Renaissance polymath, so he's from the 15th to early 16th century. I think\
      \ he was born in 1452. As for his death, I believe he died in 1519. So to check\
      \ his age, subtract 1452 from 1519. Let me calculate that: 1519 minus 1452.\
      \ Hmm, 1519 - 1450 is 69, so subtracting 2 more gives 67. Wait, wait, no. 1452\
      \ to 1519 is 67 years. So da Vinci was 67 years old when he died.\n\nNow Judy\
      \ Garland. She's more modern, an actress known for The Wizard of Oz. Her birth\
      \ year... I think she was born in 1922. Her death year was... I recall she died\
      \ relatively young, maybe in the late 1960s. Let me think. I believe she passed\
      \ away in 1969. So if she was born in 1922 and died in 1969, that's 1969 - 1922\
      \ = 47 years old. \n\nWait, but I should double-check those dates to make sure.\
      \ Let me verify. Leonardo da Vinci: born April 15, 1452, died May 2, 1519. That\
      \ would make him 67 years old. Correct. For Judy Garland, born June 10, 1922,\
      \ died June 22, 1969. So 1969 minus 1922 is indeed 47 years. She was 47 when\
      \ she died. \n\nSo comparing the two: Judy Garland was 47, Leonardo da Vinci\
      \ was 67. Therefore, yes, Judy Garland was younger at her time of death than\
      \ Leonardo da Vinci at his. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES. Judy\
      \ Garland was 47 years old at her death in 1969, while Leonardo da Vinci was\
      \ 67 years old when he died in 1519. Thus, Garland was younger. \n\nStep-by-Step\
      \ Explanation:\n1. **Leonardo da Vinci's Age**: Born April 15, 1452; died May\
      \ 2, 1519.  \n   - Death year (1519) - Birth year (1452) = 67 years old.  \n\

    c53e7e6a-401b-49a7-80cd-b53f89142d92: '<think>Okay, let''s tackle this question.
      So, the question is whether Judy Garland was younger when she died than Leonardo
      da Vinci was when he died. Hmm. I need to figure out both of their ages at death
      and compare them.


      First, I should recall when each of them was born and when they died. Let''s
      start with Leonardo da Vinci. I remember he was a Renaissance man, so probably
      15th or 16th century. From what I remember, he was born in 1452. His death year...
      I think he died in 1519. So if that''s right, he lived from 1452 to 1519. To
      get his age at death, subtract 1452 from 1519. Let me calculate that: 1519 minus
      1452. That would be 67 years old. Wait, 1519-1452: 1452 + 67 is 1519. Yeah,
      so da Vinci was 67 when he died.


      Now Judy Garland. She''s more modern. She was an actress, known for The Wizard
      of Oz. I think she was born in the 1920s maybe? Let me think. Judy Garland was
      born in 1922, I believe. And she died in 1969. Her death was relatively young,
      I think due to drug-related issues. So, 1969 minus 1922. Let me calculate that.
      1969 - 1922 = 47 years old. So she was 47 when she died.


      So comparing the two: da Vinci was 67, Judy Garland was 47. So yes, Judy Garland
      was younger at her time of death than Leonardo da Vinci. The answer should be
      YES.

      </think>Judy Garland was born in 1922 and died in 1969, making her 47 years
      old at her death. Leonardo da Vinci was born in 1452 and died in 1519, living
      to 67 years old. Since 47 is less than 67, Judy Garland was indeed younger at
      her time of death.


      ANSWER: YES'

      \ deaths.\n\nFirst, I should figure out their birth years and death years. Let's\
      \ start with Mustafa Kemal Atat\xFCrk. From what I remember, he was the founder\
      \ of modern Turkey. I think he was born in 1881. When did he die? I believe\

      \ died in 1938, his age would be 1938 minus 1881. Let me calculate that: 1938\
      \ - 1881 equals 57 years old. So Atat\xFCrk died at 57.\n\nNow, Mother Teresa.\
      \ She was a Catholic nun known for her charitable work. She was born later,\
      \ I think in 1910. She died more recently, maybe in the late 1990s. I recall\
      \ her death was in 1997. So if she was born in 1910 and died in 1997, subtracting\
      \ 1910 from 1997 gives 87 years old. Wait, that seems right because she lived\
      \ a long life.\n\nSo Atat\xFCrk was 57, Mother Teresa was 87. Comparing the\
      \ two, 57 is definitely younger than 87. Therefore, the answer should be YES,\
      \ Atat\xFCrk was younger at his time of death than Mother Teresa was at hers.\n\
      </think>YES  \nAtat\xFCrk was born in 1881 and died in 1938, making him 57 years\
      \ old at his death. Mother Teresa was born in 1910 and died in 1997, living\
      \ to 87 years old. Since 57 is younger than 87, the answer is YES."

      \ I think that's right. So if he was born in 1881 and died in 1938, let's calculate\

      \ Atat\xFCrk's dates are commonly cited as 1881-1938, so 57. Mother Teresa:\
      \ born 1910, died 1997. That would make her 87. So comparing 57 and 87, clearly\
      \ 57 is younger. Therefore, Atat\xFCrk was younger at his death than Mother\
      \ Teresa was at her death. So the answer should be YES.\n\nBut let me just double-check\
      \ in case I mixed up any dates. Maybe I confused someone else's birth year.\
      \ For example, could Mother Teresa have been born earlier? No, I think 1910\

      \ to figure out the birth and death years of both individuals. Let's start with\
      \ Atat\xFCrk. I recall that he was the founder of modern Turkey. He was born\

      \ out the birth and death years of both individuals. Let's start with Joseph\
      \ Goebbels. From what I remember, he was a prominent Nazi official, Hitler's\
      \ Minister of Propaganda. He died towards the end of World War II. I think he\
      \ died in 1945, around the time when Hitler committed suicide. As for his birth\
      \ year, I'm a bit fuzzy, but I recall he was born in the late 19th or early\
      \ 20th century. Maybe around 1897? Let me double-check that. Hmm, yes, I think\
      \ Goebbels was born on October 29, 1897. He died on May 1, 1945. So if that's\
      \ correct, he would have been 47 years old when he died. Wait, let me calculate:\
      \ from 1897 to 1945 is 48 years, but since his birthday is in October, and he\
      \ died in May, he hadn't turned 48 yet. So 1945 minus 1897 is 48, but subtract\
      \ one year because he died before his birthday. Wait, no, that's not right.\
      \ If he was born in 1897, then in 1945, he would be 1945 - 1897 = 48 years old,\
      \ but since his birthday is October 29 and he died on May 1, he would still\
      \ be 47, because he hadn't reached his birthday that year. Yes, because from\
      \ October 29, 1944, to October 29, 1945, he would turn 48, but he died in May,\
      \ so 47.\n\nNow, J. P. Morgan. He was a famous American financier and banker.\
      \ I think he lived in the late 19th and early 20th century. His death year...\
      \ I believe he died around 1913. Let me confirm. J. P. Morgan was born on April\
      \ 17, 1837, and died on March 31, 1913. So calculating his age at death: 1913\
      \ minus 1837. Let's see, 1837 + 76 = 1913, so 76 years old. Wait, but he died\
      \ on March 31, 1913, and his birthday was April 17. So he died just a few weeks\
      \ before his 76th birthday. Therefore, he was 75 years old at the time of death.\
      \ Wait, no. 1913 minus 1837 is 76 years, but since he died before his birthday\
      \ in 1913, it's 76 minus 1, so 75? Wait, no, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let's\
      \ do it properly. If he was born in 1837, then from April 17, 1837, to April\
      \ 17, 1913, is exactly 76 years. But he died on March 31, 1913, which is 17\
      \ days before his 76th birthday. So his age at death would be 75 years, 11 months,\
      \ and some days. But in terms of completed years, he was 75 years old. Wait,\
      \ but sometimes when calculating age, it's based on the difference in years,\
      \ regardless of the exact date. Hmm, this could be a point of confusion. Let's\
      \ check: 1913 - 1837 = 76, but because he hadn't reached his birthday in 1913\
      \ yet, his age was 75. So that's correct. He was 75 years old when he died.\n\
      \nWait, but here's the thing. When you subtract the birth year from the death\
      \ year, if the death occurred before the birthday, you subtract one. So for\
      \ J. P. Morgan, 1913 - 1837 = 76, but since he died before April 17, he was\
      \ 75. So yes, 75.\n\nSo Goebbels died at 47 (or 48?), and Morgan at 75. Wait,\
      \ let me confirm Goebbels again. Born 1897, died 1945. 1945 - 1897 = 48. But\
      \ he died in May 1, and his birthday was October 29. So from October 29, 1944,\
      \ to October 29, 1945, he would be 48. But since he died in May 1945, he hadn't\
      \ turned 48 yet, so he was 47 years old. Therefore, 47 vs. 75. So the answer\

      \ Joseph Goebbels was younger when he died compared to J. P. Morgan. \n\nFirst,\
      \ I need to know the birth and death years of both people. Let me start with\
      \ Joseph Goebbels. From what I remember, he was a prominent figure in Nazi Germany,\
      \ serving as the Minister of Propaganda. I think he was born in the late 19th\
      \ or early 20th century. Maybe around 1897? And he died in 1945 when World War\
      \ II ended. I recall that he committed suicide in the F\xFChrerbunker in Berlin\
      \ when the Allies were closing in. So if he was born in 1897 and died in 1945,\
      \ that would make him 48 years old at the time of his death. Wait, let me check\
      \ that math. 1945 minus 1897 is indeed 48 years.\n\nNow, J. P. Morgan. He was\
      \ an American financier and banker. His full name is John Pierpont Morgan, right?\
      \ I think he lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. I believe he was\
      \ born in 1837 and died in 1913. Let me confirm that. If he was born in 1837\
      \ and died in 1913, subtracting 1837 from 1913 gives 76 years. So he would have\
      \ been 76 years old when he died.\n\nComparing the two: Goebbels was 48, Morgan\
      \ was 76. So yes, Goebbels was younger at the time of his death than Morgan\
      \ was. But wait, did I get the dates right? Let me double-check because sometimes\
      \ dates can be a bit off. \n\nJoseph Goebbels: Born October 29, 1897, died May\
      \ 1, 1945. So 1945 minus 1897 is indeed 48 (since he was born in October and\
      \ died in May, he hadn't turned 48 yet, but maybe the calculation is done by\
      \ the year). Wait, exact age would be 47 years and a few months. But generally,\
      \ historical records might list his age as 47 or 48 depending on the exact calculation.\
      \ However, the standard way is to subtract the birth year from the death year\
      \ and adjust if the birthday hasn't occurred. Since he died in May, and his\
      \ birthday is in October, he was 47 years old at death. Hmm, now this is getting\
      \ a bit more complicated. If he was born in 1897, then in 1945, before his birthday,\
      \ he would be 47. But often, historical references might round up or just use\
      \ the year difference. For example, 1945 - 1897 = 48. So perhaps most sources\
      \ would say he was 47, but maybe some say 48. Wait, this could be a potential\
      \ mistake here.\n\nSimilarly, J.P. Morgan: born April 17, 1837, died March 31,\
      \ 1913. So in 1913, he had not yet had his birthday (since his birthday is in\
      \ April and he died in March). So 1913 - 1837 = 76, but since he died a few\
      \ days before his 76th birthday, his exact age was 75 years, 11 months, etc.\
      \ So again, depending on the source, they might list his age as 75 or 76.\n\n\
      So now the problem is that if we consider exact ages, Goebbels was 47 years\
      \ and about 4 months old when he died (born October 1897, died May 1945). So\
      \ 1945 - 1897 = 48, but subtract 1 because his birthday hadn't occurred. So\
      \ 47. Similarly, Morgan was 75 years old, 1913 - 1837 = 76, but he died just\
      \ before his birthday, so 75. \n\nBut maybe the question is just considering\
      \ the difference in years without accounting for the exact months. If that's\
      \ the case, then Goebbels is 48 and Morgan is 76. Then the answer would be yes.\
      \ But if we consider the exact age, Goebbels was 47 and Morgan 75. Either way,\
      \ the answer is still yes, Goebbels was younger. But perhaps the exact answer\
      \ depends on the calculation method.\n\nHowever, in most cases, when comparing\
      \ historical figures' ages, the difference in years (subtracting birth year\
      \ from death year) is sufficient. So Goebbels: 1945 - 1897 = 48. Morgan: 1913\
      \ - 1837 = 76. Therefore, 48 is younger than 76. So the answer is YES.\n</think>**Answer:**\
      \ YES  \nJoseph Goebbels was born in 1897 and died in 1945, making him approximately\
      \ 47\u201348 years old at death. J. P. Morgan was born in 1837 and died in 1913,\
      \ at approximately 75\u201376 years old. Regardless of exact birth/death dates\

      \ his birthday is in October, and he died in May, he hadn't turned 48 yet? Wait,\
      \ 1945 minus 1897 is 48. But since his birthday is October 29, and he died on\
      \ May 1, he was 47 years old, right? Because he would have turned 48 in October\
      \ 1945, but he died in May. So actually, he was 47 years and about 6 months\
      \ old when he died. Hmm, that's a detail that could affect the calculation.\
      \ Let me double-check that. If someone is born in October 1897, by October 1944,\
      \ they turn 47. Then from October 1944 to May 1945 is 7 months. So they're 47\
      \ years and 7 months old. So yes, he was 47 years old at death.\n\nNow, J.P.\
      \ Morgan. He was a famous American financier and banker. I need his birth and\
      \ death years. I recall that he lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\
      \ I think he died around 1913. Let me confirm. John Pierpont Morgan was born\
      \ on April 17, 1837, and died on March 31, 1913. So calculating his age at death:\
      \ 1913 minus 1837 is 76 years. But again, considering the exact months. He was\
      \ born in April, died in March. So from April 1837 to April 1913 would be 76\
      \ years. But he died in March 1913, so he was 75 years and 11 months old. Therefore,\
      \ he was 75 years old at death, not yet 76. Wait, that's a key point. Let me\
      \ verify. If you subtract 1837 from 1913, you get 76, but since his birthday\
      \ was in April and he died in March, he hadn't reached his 76th birthday. So\
      \ his age at death was 75 years. Therefore, J.P. Morgan was 75 when he died.\n\
      \nSo comparing the two: Goebbels was 47 (or 48?), and Morgan was 75. Wait, there's\
      \ a discrepancy here. Let me recheck Goebbels. Born 1897, died 1945. 1945 minus\
      \ 1897 equals 48. But if he died before his birthday in 1945, he would be 47.\
      \ Let's calculate the exact age. October 29, 1897, to May 1, 1945. From October\
      \ 29, 1897, to October 29, 1944, that's 47 years. Then from October 29, 1944,\
      \ to May 1, 1945, that's 6 months and 2 days (since May is the fifth month,\
      \ so from October to May is 7 months, but October 29 to May 1 is actually 6\
      \ months and 2 days). So total age is 47 years, 6 months, and 2 days. Therefore,\
      \ he was 47 years old. Hence, Goebbels was 47, Morgan was 75. So yes, Goebbels\
      \ was younger at the time of his death.\n</think>Joseph Goebbels was born on\
      \ October 29, 1897, and died on May 1, 1945, making him **47 years old** at\
      \ the time of his death. J.P. Morgan was born on April 17, 1837, and died on\
      \ March 31, 1913, making him **75 years old** at the time of his death. Since\
      \ 47 is younger than 75, the answer is:\n\n**YES**"
    85719568-89fa-4327-b8b9-e768d9bc5e0e: '<think>Okay, let me try to figure this
      out. The question is whether Joseph Goebbels was younger at his time of death
      than J. P. Morgan was at his. So, I need to find out the ages of both when they
      died and compare them.


      First, I need to recall their birth and death years. Let me start with Joseph
      Goebbels. I remember he was a high-ranking Nazi official, Hitler''s propaganda
      minister. He died around the end of World War II, right? I think he died in
      1945. For his birth year, maybe late 1800s or early 1900s. Wait, I think he
      was born in 1897. Let me check that. Yes, Joseph Goebbels was born on October
      29, 1897, and he died on May 1, 1945. So to calculate his age at death: 1945
      minus 1897. Let''s do the math. 1945 - 1897 = 48 years. Wait, but he was born
      in October, so if he died in May, he hadn''t turned 48 yet? Wait no, wait 1945
      minus 1897: 1897 + 48 = 1945. So he was 47 years old when he died? Wait, maybe
      my math is a bit off. Let me calculate again. From October 1897 to October 1945
      would be 48 years, but he died in May 1945, which is 5 months before his birthday.
      So he was 47 years and about 6 months old. So his age at death was 47 years.


      Now, J. P. Morgan. He was a famous American financier and banker. I think he
      lived in the late 19th and early 20th century. Let me recall his birth and death
      dates. I believe he was born in 1837 and died in 1913. Let me confirm. Yes,
      John Pierpont Morgan was born April 17, 1837, and died on March 31, 1913. So
      his age at death would be 1913 minus 1837. Let''s calculate that. 1913 - 1837
      = 76 years. But again, checking the months: he was born in April and died in
      March, so he was 75 years and 11 months old. So his age at death was 75 years.


      Comparing the two: Goebbels was 47, Morgan was 75. So yes, Goebbels was younger
      when he died than Morgan. Therefore, the answer should be YES.

      </think>Joseph Goebbels was born on October 29, 1897, and died on May 1, 1945,
      making him 47 years old at his death. J. P. Morgan was born on April 17, 1837,
      and died on March 31, 1913, at the age of 75. Since 47 is less than 75, **YES**,
      Goebbels was younger at the time of his death than Morgan.'
    ad3a8a84-5a35-4ca6-aac2-c45cf13baaf7: '<think>Alright, let''s tackle this question.
      So, the question is whether Joseph Goebbels was younger at the time of his death
      than J.P. Morgan was when he died. Hmm, okay. I need to figure out their birth
      years and death years, then calculate their ages at death and compare them.


      First, let me recall who these people are. Joseph Goebbels was a prominent figure
      in Nazi Germany, Hitler''s propaganda minister. I think he died around the end
      of World War II, maybe 1945? And J.P. Morgan was an American financier and banker,
      right? He was a big name in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. I''m not
      exactly sure of his death year, but maybe around the 1910s or 1920s?


      Let me get the exact dates. For Joseph Goebbels: I believe he was born in 1897.
      Let me check that... Yes, Paul Joseph Goebbels was born on October 29, 1897.
      He died on May 1, 1945. So, calculating his age at death: 1945 minus 1897. Let''s
      do the math. 1945 - 1897 = 48 years. But wait, his birthday is in October, so
      if he died in May, he hadn''t turned 48 yet. Wait, 1945 minus 1897 is 48, but
      since he died in May, he was 47 years old, right? Because he was born in October,
      so from October 1897 to October 1944 would be 47 years, and then from October
      1944 to May 1945, he was 47 years and 7 months. So he was 47 when he died. Hmm,
      maybe I should confirm that. Let''s see: 1945 - 1897 = 48, but since his birthday
      hadn''t occurred yet in 1945 (he died in May, birthday in October), he was 47
      years old. So Goebbels was 47 at death.


      Now, J.P. Morgan. John Pierpont Morgan. I think he was born in 1837. Let me
      verify. Yes, J.P. Morgan was born on April 17, 1837, and died on March 31, 1913.
      So calculating his age at death: 1913 minus 1837. That''s 76 years. But again,
      his birthday was in April, and he died in March, so he hadn''t turned 76 yet.
      Wait, 1913 - 1837 = 76, but since he died in March and his birthday was in April,
      he was 75 years old. Let me check: from April 17, 1837, to April 17, 1912, he
      would be 75. Then from April 1912 to March 31, 1913, he was 75 years and 11
      months. So he was 75 when he died. Wait, but some sources might round up. Let
      me confirm. If he was born in 1837 and died in 1913, that''s 76 years, but since
      he died before his birthday in 1913, he was 75. So J.P. Morgan was 75 at death.


      So Goebbels died at 47, Morgan at 75. Therefore, yes, Goebbels was younger when
      he died than Morgan. So the answer is YES.

      </think>Joseph Goebbels was born on October 29, 1897, and died on May 1, 1945,
      making him 47 years old at the time of his death. J.P. Morgan was born on April
      17, 1837, and died on March 31, 1913, at the age of 75. Since 47 is younger
      than 75, **YES**, Goebbels was younger at his time of death than J.P. Morgan.'

      \ 1945. To find his age at death: 1945 minus 1897. Let's calculate that. 1945\
      \ - 1897 = 48 years old. Wait, but let me check the exact months. He was born\
      \ in October 1897 and died in May 1945. So from October 1897 to October 1944\
      \ would be 47 years, and then from October 1944 to May 1945 is another 7 months.\
      \ So he was 47 years and 7 months old when he died. So approximately 47 years\

      \ he hadn't reached his 48th birthday yet. So technically, he was 47 years old\
      \ at death. Wait, but sometimes people count the years as completed. So 1945\
      \ minus 1897 is 48, but if he died before his birthday in 1945, he would be\
      \ 47. Since his birthday is in October and he died in May, he hadn't turned\
      \ 48 yet. So his age at death was 47 years. Hmm, that's a bit of a detail, but\
      \ important for accuracy.\n\nNow, J.P. Morgan. John Pierpont Morgan. Let me\
      \ recall his dates. He was born in 1837, I think. Died in 1913. Let me confirm.\
      \ Yes, J.P. Morgan was born on April 17, 1837, and died on March 31, 1913. So\
      \ his birth year is 1837, death 1913. Calculating his age at death: 1913 minus\
      \ 1837. That's 76 years. But again, checking the exact months. He was born in\
      \ April 1837, died in March 1913. So from April 1837 to April 1912 is 75 years,\
      \ and then he died in March 1913, which is 11 months after his 75th birthday.\
      \ So he was 75 years and 11 months old. So his age at death was 75 years. So\
      \ even though 1913-1837 is 76, he died just before his 76th birthday, so he\
      \ was 75.\n\nSo Goebbels was 47 (or 48 if you count the year difference without\
      \ considering the exact months), and Morgan was 75 (or 76 if you just subtract\
      \ the years). But the accurate calculation based on birth and death dates would\
      \ be Goebbels at 47 and Morgan at 75. Therefore, Goebbels was indeed younger\

    464556d7-d21d-463d-86e5-7d1ebbf47287: '<think>Okay, let''s tackle this question
      step by step. The question is whether Vincent van Gogh was younger when he died
      than Oskar Schindler was at his death. First, I need to find out the birth and
      death years of both individuals to calculate their ages at death.


      Starting with Vincent van Gogh. From what I remember, Van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist
      painter. He died relatively young, I think. Let me recall... He was born in
      1853. His death, I believe, was in 1890. So if he was born in 1853 and died
      in 1890, that would make him 37 years old. Wait, 1890 minus 1853 is 37. Yeah,
      that''s right. He died at 37, I think from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.


      Now, Oskar Schindler. He''s known for saving Jews during the Holocaust by employing
      them in his factories. Let me think about his lifespan. I think he was born
      in the early 20th century. Wait, Schindler was born in 1908, if I''m not mistaken.
      And he died in 1974. Let''s confirm that. If he was born in 1908 and died in
      1974, that would make him 66 years old. 1974 minus 1908 is 66. So Schindler
      was 66 when he died.


      Comparing the two ages: Van Gogh at 37 and Schindler at 66. So yes, Van Gogh
      was younger at his time of death than Schindler was. Therefore, the answer should
      be YES.

      \ 1974, that would make him 66 years old at the time of his death. \n\nWait,\
      \ let me confirm these dates because getting the years right is crucial here.\

      \ Jews during the Holocaust, right? The movie \"Schindler's List\" is about\

      \ he was a Dutch painter from the 19th century, known for works like \"Starry\
      \ Night.\" I think he died relatively young. Let me recall... I believe he was\
      \ born in 1853 and died in 1890. If that's correct, then his age at death would\

      \ \"Schindler's List.\" I think he lived longer than van Gogh. Let me recall\
      \ his dates. I believe Schindler was born in 1908 and died in 1974. Wait, no,\
      \ maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Let me check in my mind. Schindler was active\
      \ during World War II, which was the 1940s. If he was born in 1908, then during\
      \ the war he would be in his 30s. But when did he die? I think he died in the\
      \ 1970s. So, 1974 minus 1908 would be 66 years old. \n\nWait, but I need to\
      \ verify these dates. Let me see. For van Gogh, quick check: born March 30,\
      \ 1853, died July 29, 1890. That makes him 37 years old. Correct. For Schindler,\
      \ born April 28, 1908, died October 9, 1974. So, 1974 minus 1908 is 66 years.\
      \ So, van Gogh was 37, Schindler was 66 at their respective times of death.\
      \ \n\nTherefore, the answer is YES, van Gogh was younger when he died than Schindler\
      \ was when he died. Because 37 is less than 66. \n\nBut just to be sure, did\
      \ I get Schindler's birth and death years right? Sometimes people confuse dates.\
      \ Schindler was a German industrialist, and he was part of the Nazi party initially\
      \ but saved over a thousand Jews. He died in 1974, which would make him 66.\
      \ That seems right. Van Gogh's early death at 37 is well-known due to his mental\

      out. The question is whether Vincent van Gogh was younger when he died compared
      to Oskar Schindler at his time of death. Hmm, I need to find out both their
      ages at death and then compare them.


      First, I''ll start with Vincent van Gogh. I remember he was a Dutch painter,
      right? I think he died in the late 1800s. Let me recall his birth and death
      years. If I''m not mistaken, he was born in 1853. His death... I think he died
      in 1890. So, calculating his age would be 1890 minus 1853. Let me do the math:
      1853 + 37 years would be 1890, so he was 37 when he died. Wait, is that right?
      Maybe I should confirm. Yeah, Van Gogh was born March 30, 1853, and died July
      29, 1890. So subtracting 1853 from 1890 gives 37 years. But since his birthday
      was in March and he died in July, he had already turned 37 that year. So, he
      was 37.


      Now, Oskar Schindler. He''s known for saving Jews during the Holocaust. I need
      his birth and death years. Let me think. I believe he was born in the early
      20th century. Maybe 1908? And he died... I think in the 1970s? Wait, no. I think
      he died in 1974. Let me check that. Schindler was born on April 28, 1908, and
      died on October 9, 1974. So, to find his age at death: 1974 minus 1908. That''s
      66 years. Wait, because from 1908 to 1974 is 66 years. So, he was 66 when he
      died.


      Now, comparing the two ages: Van Gogh was 37, Schindler was 66. So yes, Van
      Gogh was younger at his time of death than Schindler. Therefore, the answer
      should be YES.

      </think>Vincent van Gogh was born in 1853 and died in 1890 at age 37. Oskar
      Schindler was born in 1908 and died in 1974 at age 66. Since 37 is younger than
      66, the answer is YES.

      \ yet, she was 48 years and about 6 months old. So her age at death is 48 years.\n\
      \nNow, Adam Smith. He's a historical figure, a philosopher and economist. I\
      \ recall he's from the 18th century. His most famous work is \"The Wealth of\
      \ Nations,\" published in 1776. Let me look up his birth and death years. Adam\
      \ Smith was born in 1723 and died in 1790. Calculating his age at death: 1790\
      \ minus 1723. That would be 67 years old. Wait, 1723 to 1790 is 67 years. So\
      \ he was 67 when he died.\n\nComparing the two: Whitney Houston was 48, Adam\
      \ Smith was 67. So yes, Whitney Houston was younger at her time of death than\
      \ Adam Smith was at his. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES \
      \ \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Whitney Houston's Dates:** Born August\
      \ 9, 1963; died February 11, 2012.  \n   - Age at death: 2012 - 1963 = 49 years,\
      \ but since she died before her birthday in August, she was **48 years old**.\
      \  \n\n2. **Adam Smith's Dates:** Born June 16, 1723; died July 17, 1790.  \n\
      \   - Age at death: 1790 - 1723 = **67 years old**.  \n\n3. **Comparison:**\
      \ 48 (Houston) < 67 (Smith).  \n**Answer:** YES, Whitney Houston was younger\
      \ at her time of death."

      \ out if Whitney Houston was younger when she died compared to Adam Smith. Hmm,\
      \ first, I should find out when each of them was born and when they died. \n\
      \nStarting with Whitney Houston. I remember she was a famous singer, right?\
      \ I think she passed away a few years ago. Wasn't her death related to something\
      \ like drowning in a bathtub? Maybe around the 2010s? Let me recall. I think\
      \ she died in 2012. Now, her birth year... she was born in the 60s, maybe 1963?\
      \ Let me confirm. Wait, I believe she was born on August 9, 1963. So if she\
      \ died in 2012, that would make her 2012 minus 1963. Let's calculate that: 2012\
      \ - 1963 = 49 years old.\n\nNow, Adam Smith. He's the economist, the father\
      \ of capitalism or something. He's from way back. Probably 18th century? So\
      \ when did he live? I think he was born in 1723 and died in 1790. Let me check\
      \ that. Yeah, Adam Smith's dates are usually listed as 1723-1790. So his age\
      \ at death would be 1790 minus 1723. That's 67 years old.\n\nSo Whitney Houston\
      \ was 49 when she died, and Adam Smith was 67. Therefore, yes, Whitney was younger\
      \ at her time of death than Adam Smith was at his. \n\nWait, but I should make\
      \ sure I didn't mix up any dates. Let me double-check. Whitney Houston: born\
      \ 1963, died 2012. 2012 - 1963 is definitely 49. Adam Smith: 1723 to 1790. 1790\

    966ac6ab-4ab2-4a91-b645-765484131405: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The question is asking whether Whitney Houston was younger at\
      \ the time of her death than Adam Smith was when he died. I need to figure out\
      \ both of their ages at death and compare them. \n\nFirst, let me recall the\
      \ birth and death dates of both individuals. Starting with Whitney Houston.\
      \ I remember she was a famous singer, so her dates might be more recent. I think\
      \ she was born in the 60s or 70s. Wait, she died a few years back. I believe\
      \ she passed away in 2012. As for her birth year, I think it's 1963. So if she\
      \ died in 2012 and was born in 1963, her age at death would be 2012 minus 1963.\
      \ Let me calculate that: 2012 - 1963 = 49 years old.\n\nNow, Adam Smith. He's\
      \ a historical figure, a philosopher and economist known for \"The Wealth of\
      \ Nations.\" He's much older. I need his birth and death years. From what I\
      \ recall, he was part of the Scottish Enlightenment in the 18th century. I think\
      \ he was born in 1723 and died in 1790. So if that's correct, his age at death\
      \ would be 1790 minus 1723. Let's do the math: 1790 - 1723. That's 67 years\
      \ old.\n\nWait, let me double-check those dates to be sure. For Whitney Houston:\
      \ Yes, according to my memory, she was born on August 9, 1963, and died on February\
      \ 11, 2012. So from August 1963 to February 2012, she was 48 years old, but\
      \ depending on the exact dates, she might have been 48 or 49. Wait, but 2012\
      \ minus 1963 is 49, but if her birthday hadn't occurred yet in 2012 when she\
      \ died in February, she would be 48. Let's check: Her birthday is in August,\
      \ and she died in February. So from August 9, 1963, to February 11, 2012, she\
      \ would have been 48 years and about 6 months. So her age at death was 48 years\
      \ old. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong earlier. Let me confirm this calculation.\
      \ If she was born in 1963, then in 2012 she would turn 49 in August. But since\
      \ she died in February, which is before August, she was still 48. So that's\
      \ 48 years old. Wait, that's conflicting with my initial calculation. So 2012\
      \ - 1963 is 49 years, but because her birthday hadn't occurred yet, subtract\
      \ one year. So she was 48. So I need to be precise here. Let's calculate the\
      \ exact age. From August 9, 1963, to August 9, 2012, is exactly 49 years. But\
      \ she died on February 11, 2012. So from August 9, 2011, to August 9, 2012,\
      \ she would have turned 49, but she died before that. So up to August 9, 2011,\
      \ she was 48. Then from August 9, 2011, to August 8, 2012, she's 49. But she\
      \ died in February, so her age at death would be 48 years and about 6 months.\
      \ So her age at death is 48. Therefore, I need to correct my initial thought.\
      \ So Whitney Houston was 48 when she died.\n\nNow Adam Smith: If he was born\
      \ in 1723 and died in 1790, let's calculate his exact age. 1790 - 1723 = 67.\
      \ Let's check the exact dates. Adam Smith was born on June 16, 1723, and died\
      \ on July 17, 1790. So from June 16, 1723, to June 16, 1790, he would be 67\
      \ years old. He died on July 17, so that's a month after his 67th birthday.\
      \ So he was 67 years old when he died.\n\nTherefore, comparing the two: Whitney\
      \ Houston was 48, Adam Smith was 67. So YES, Whitney Houston was younger at\
      \ the time of her death than Adam Smith was at his time of death.\n</think>YES\
      \  \n**Reasoning:**  \n1. **Whitney Houston** was born on August 9, 1963, and\
      \ died on February 11, 2012. She passed away before her 49th birthday in 2012,\
      \ making her **48 years old** at the time of death.  \n2. **Adam Smith** was\
      \ born on June 16, 1723, and died on July 17, 1790. He lived past his 67th birthday\
      \ in 1790, making him **67 years old** at the time of death.  \n3. Comparing\
      \ the ages: **48 (Houston)** < **67 (Smith)**. Thus, the answer is **YES**."

      \ step by step. The question is whether Jesse Owens was younger when he died\
      \ than Henry Ford when he died. So, I need to find out the birth and death years\
      \ of both individuals, calculate their ages at death, and then compare them.\n\
      \nStarting with Jesse Owens. From what I remember, Jesse Owens was a famous\
      \ American track and field athlete, known for his performance in the 1936 Berlin\
      \ Olympics. I think he was born in the early 20th century. Let me recall...\
      \ I believe he was born in 1913. Now, when did he die? Hmm, I think he passed\
      \ away in the late 1970s or early 1980s. Maybe around 1980. Wait, yes, I think\
      \ Jesse Owens died in 1980. So, if he was born in 1913 and died in 1980, that\
      \ would make him 1980 - 1913 = 67 years old at the time of his death.\n\nNow,\
      \ Henry Ford. He's the founder of Ford Motor Company, right? A key figure in\
      \ the automotive industry. Let me recall his lifespan. Henry Ford was born in\
      \ 1863, I think. And he died in... maybe the 1940s? Let me check in my memory.\
      \ Yes, Henry Ford died in 1947. So, calculating his age: 1947 - 1863. Let's\
      \ see, 1947 minus 1863. 1863 + 84 = 1947, so he was 84 years old when he died.\n\
      \nWait, so Jesse Owens was 67, Henry Ford was 84. Comparing the two, 67 is younger\
      \ than 84. So, yes, Jesse Owens was younger at the time of his death than Henry\
      \ Ford.\n\nLet me just double-check the years to be sure. Owens: born September\
      \ 12, 1913, died March 31, 1980. That's 66 years, actually, because 1980 - 1913\
      \ is 67, but depending on the exact months. He was born in September 1913 and\
      \ died in March 1980, so he hadn't reached his 67th birthday yet. So 66 years\
      \ old. Henry Ford: born July 30, 1863, died April 7, 1947. So 1947-1863 is 84\
      \ years, and since his death was in April, he had already had his birthday in\
      \ July the previous year, so 83 years and some months. Wait, actually, if he\
      \ was born July 30, 1863, then in 1947, on April 7, he hadn't yet reached his\
      \ 84th birthday. So 83 years old? Wait, that would change things. Let me recalculate.\n\
      \nCalculating age accurately requires considering the exact birth and death\
      \ dates. For Henry Ford: from July 30, 1863, to April 7, 1947. So from July\
      \ 30, 1863, to July 30, 1946, that's 83 years. Then from July 30, 1946, to April\
      \ 7, 1947, is another 8 months and 8 days. So he was 83 years and about 8 months\
      \ old when he died. So his age at death would be 83 years. Wait, but often,\
      \ when people state the age, they count the completed years. So if he hadn't\
      \ reached his 84th birthday by the death date, he's 83.\n\nSimilarly, Jesse\
      \ Owens: born September 12, 1913, died March 31, 1980. So from September 12,\
      \ 1913, to September 12, 1979, that's 66 years. Then from September 12, 1979,\
      \ to March 31, 1980, is about 6 months and 19 days. So he was 66 years old at\
      \ death, having not yet reached 67.\n\nSo Henry Ford was 83, Jesse Owens 66.\
      \ So the answer is still YES, Jesse was younger at death than Henry Ford. Wait,\
      \ but earlier I thought Henry Ford was 84. So maybe there's confusion here.\
      \ Let me check again.\n\nWait, 1947 minus 1863. 1863 + 84 = 1947. So 84 years.\
      \ But because he died in April before his birthday in July, he was 83 years\
      \ and 8 months. So depending on whether age is counted as the number of completed\
      \ years. In many contexts, you subtract the birth year from the death year and\
      \ then adjust if the death date is before the birthday. So Henry Ford was 83\
      \ years old when he died. Similarly, Jesse Owens was 66 years old.\n\nSo 66\
      \ vs 83. Therefore, the answer is YES, Jesse was younger at death.\n</think>**Step-by-Step\
      \ Explanation:**\n\n1. **Jesse Owens:**\n   - **Born:** September 12, 1913\n\
      \   - **Died:** March 31, 1980\n   - **Age Calculation:** 1980 - 1913 = 67 years,\

    17e9b1fc-f64b-44a8-9453-18162334560c: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The question is whether Jesse Owens was younger at the time\
      \ of his death than Henry Ford was when he died. To answer this, I need to find\
      \ out the birth and death years of both individuals and then calculate their\
      \ ages at death.\n\nFirst, I'll start with Jesse Owens. From what I remember,\
      \ Jesse Owens was a famous track and field athlete, known for his performance\
      \ in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. I think he was born around the early 1900s. Let\
      \ me check the exact dates. Oh right, Jesse Owens was born on September 12,\
      \ 1913. Now, when did he die? I recall he passed away in 1980. So, if he died\
      \ in 1980, subtracting his birth year from his death year gives 1980 - 1913\
      \ = 67 years old. Wait, but I should make sure about the exact dates. If he\
      \ was born in September 1913 and died in March 1980, he would have been 66 years\
      \ old, but if he died after September 1980, he would have been 67. Let me confirm.\
      \ Jesse Owens died on March 31, 1980. So, he was 66 years old at the time of\
      \ his death because he hadn't reached his 67th birthday yet. Hmm, but sometimes\
      \ people just calculate based on the years, not the exact months. Let me double-check\
      \ that. Born 1913, died 1980: 1980 - 1913 = 67. But since his birthday is in\
      \ September and he died in March, he was 66 years and about 6 months old. So\
      \ technically, he was 66 years old. But sometimes, in such questions, they might\
      \ just use the year difference. I need to be precise here. So, 1980 minus 1913\
      \ is 67, but since he died before his birthday, it's 66. So, 66 years old.\n\
      \nNow, Henry Ford. He was the founder of Ford Motor Company. I know he lived\
      \ into his 80s. Let me get his exact dates. Henry Ford was born on July 30,\
      \ 1863, and died on April 7, 1947. So, calculating his age at death: 1947 minus\
      \ 1863. That's 84 years. But again, checking the exact dates. He was born in\
      \ July 1863 and died in April 1947. So, he hadn't reached his 84th birthday\
      \ yet. Wait, 1947 - 1863 = 84, but since he died in April, which is before July,\
      \ he was 83 years old. Wait, no: 1947 minus 1863 is 84, but if you subtract\
      \ the years, 1863 to 1947 is 84 years. However, because his birthday is in July\
      \ and he died in April, he was 83 years and about 8 months old. So, technically,\
      \ he was 83 when he died. But again, sometimes people just go by the year difference.\
      \ So, 84 or 83? Let me confirm. If you were born in 1863, in 1947 you would\
      \ be 84 only if your birthday had passed. Since he died in April, which is before\
      \ July, he was 83. So, 83 years old.\n\nSo, Jesse Owens died at 66 (or 67 if\
      \ counting by year difference), and Henry Ford at 83 (or 84). Therefore, Jesse\
      \ Owens was younger at the time of his death than Henry Ford. So the answer\
      \ is YES.\n</think>Jesse Owens was born on September 12, 1913, and died on March\
      \ 31, 1980, making him 66 years old at death. Henry Ford was born on July 30,\
      \ 1863, and died on April 7, 1947, making him 83 years old at death. Since 66\
      \ is less than 83, the answer is YES. \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    233be438-2d3b-46e4-bd08-219b74110a49: "<think>Alright, let me figure this out.\
      \ The question is whether Jesse Owens was younger at the time of his death than\

      \ with Jesse Owens. From what I remember, Jesse Owens was a famous track and\
      \ field athlete, known for his performance in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. I think\
      \ he was born in the early 1900s. Let me see... I recall he was born in 1913.\
      \ When did he die? I think he passed away in the 1980s. Maybe 1980? So if he\
      \ was born in 1913 and died in 1980, that would make him 67 years old at the\
      \ time of death.\n\nNow Henry Ford. He's the founder of Ford Motor Company.\
      \ He was an industrialist. I know he lived a long life. His birth year was probably\
      \ mid-19th century. Let's say 1863? And his death year... I think he died in\
      \ the 1940s. Maybe 1947? If he was born in 1863 and died in 1947, subtracting\
      \ gives 1947 - 1863 = 84 years old. \n\nWait, but I need to be sure about the\
      \ exact dates. Let me double-check. Jesse Owens: Born September 12, 1913, died\
      \ March 31, 1980. So that's 1980 minus 1913. 1980 - 1913 = 67 years. Correct.\
      \ \n\nHenry Ford: Born July 30, 1863, died April 7, 1947. So 1947 minus 1863.\
      \ Let's calculate that: 1863 + 84 = 1947. So he was 83 years old when he died?\
      \ Wait, 1947 - 1863. Let's do the math step by step. From 1863 to 1900 is 37\
      \ years, then from 1900 to 1947 is 47 years. 37 + 47 = 84. Wait, but if he was\
      \ born in July 1863 and died in April 1947, he hadn't reached his 84th birthday\
      \ yet. So he was 83 years old at death. Because from July 1863 to July 1946\
      \ is 83 years, and then from July 1946 to April 1947 is another 9 months, so\
      \ he was 83 years and 9 months old. So his age would be 83 years. \n\nTherefore,\
      \ Jesse Owens was 67, Henry Ford was 83. So yes, Jesse Owens was younger at\
      \ his time of death than Henry Ford.\n</think>Jesse Owens was born in 1913 and\
      \ died in 1980, making him **67** years old at death. Henry Ford was born in\
      \ 1863 and died in 1947, making him **83** years old at death. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    506b8dbd-ac17-4853-bc43-874a2ef5bdd1: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure this\
      \ out. The question is whether Jesse Owens was younger when he died compared\
      \ to Henry Ford when he died. So first, I need to find out the birth and death\
      \ years of both individuals, then calculate their ages at death, and compare\
      \ them.\n\nStarting with Jesse Owens. I know he was an American track and field\
      \ athlete, famous for the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Let me recall his dates.\
      \ I think he was born in 1913... or was it 1912? Wait, I might be mixing up\
      \ some details. Let me double-check. Hmm, Owens was born on September 12, 1913.\
      \ Now, when did he die? I remember he died in 1980. So if he was born in 1913\
      \ and died in 1980, that would make him 66 years old (1980 - 1913 = 67, but\
      \ since his birthday is in September, if he died before September 12, he would\
      \ have been 66. Wait, when exactly did he die? I think it was March 31, 1980.\
      \ So up to March 31, 1980, he hadn't had his birthday yet in that year, so 1980\
      \ - 1913 = 67, but subtract one year because he died before his birthday, so\
      \ 66 years old. Wait, actually, the calculation is death year minus birth year,\
      \ and if the death date is before the birthday in the death year, subtract 1.\
      \ So, 1980 - 1913 = 67, but since he died in March and his birthday was September,\
      \ he was 66 years old at death. Let me confirm that. Yes, Jesse Owens died at\
      \ age 66.\n\nNow Henry Ford. He's the founder of Ford Motor Company, right?\
      \ His dates. He was born in 1863, I believe. July 30, 1863. And he died in 1947.\
      \ Let me check that. Yes, Henry Ford died on April 7, 1947. So calculating his\
      \ age: 1947 - 1863 = 84 years. But again, check the birth date. He was born\
      \ in July, died in April, so he hadn't had his 84th birthday yet. Wait, 1947\
      \ minus 1863 is 84. Let's see, if he was born July 30, 1863, and died April\
      \ 7, 1947, that's 83 years and about 8 months. So his age at death would be\
      \ 83 years old, not 84. Because he didn't reach his birthday in 1947. So 1947\
      \ - 1863 = 84, but subtract 1 because he died before July 30. So 83 years old.\n\
      \nWait, that seems conflicting. Let me make sure. Let's compute the exact age.\
      \ If he was born on July 30, 1863, then on July 30, 1946, he would turn 83.\
      \ From July 30, 1946, to April 7, 1947, he is 83 years old. So yes, when he\
      \ died on April 7, 1947, he was 83 years old. So Henry Ford was 83 when he died.\n\
      \nSo Jesse Owens was 66, Henry Ford 83. Therefore, Jesse Owens was younger at\
      \ the time of his death than Henry Ford. Wait, but wait, let me confirm the\
      \ exact dates again to avoid mistakes. Because sometimes even a small error\
      \ can flip the answer.\n\nJesse Owens: September 12, 1913 \u2013 March 31, 1980.\
      \ So from 1913 to 1980 is 67 years, but he died in March, before his September\
      \ birthday. Therefore, 1980 - 1913 = 67, minus 1 = 66. Correct.\n\nHenry Ford:\
      \ July 30, 1863 \u2013 April 7, 1947. So 1947 - 1863 = 84. But he died in April,\
      \ which is before his July birthday, so subtract 1: 83. Correct.\n\nSo 66 vs.\
      \ 83. Therefore, YES, Jesse Owens was younger at their time of death than Henry\
      \ Ford.\n\nWait, but wait, I just found conflicting information. Let me check\
      \ another source. Maybe my memory is wrong. Wait, according to sources, Jesse\
      \ Owens was born September 12, 1913, died March 31, 1980. That gives his age\
      \ as 66. Henry Ford: born July 30, 1863, died April 7, 1947. So 83 years old.\
      \ So yes, 66 < 83. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step\
      \ Explanation:**  \n1. **Jesse Owens' Dates:** Born September 12, 1913; died\
      \ March 31, 1980.  \n   - Age at death: 1980 - 1913 = 67 years. However, since\

      \ 1947 minus 1863 is 84 years. But since he died in April and was born in July,\
      \ he was 83 years old at the time of death, right? Because he hadn't reached\
      \ his 84th birthday yet. Wait, wait, 1947 minus 1863 is 84, but since he died\

      \ Jesse Owens and Henry Ford when they died and then compare them. Let me start\
      \ by recalling what I know about these two historical figures.\n\nFirst, Jesse\
      \ Owens. I remember he was an American track and field athlete, famous for his\
      \ performance in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. I think he was born in the early\
      \ 20th century. Let me check the dates. Wait, I should recall his birth and\
      \ death years. If I'm not mistaken, Jesse Owens was born in 1913. When did he\
      \ die? I think he passed away in 1980. So if he was born in 1913 and died in\
      \ 1980, that would make him 66 years old at the time of his death. Let me confirm\
      \ that. Yes, James Cleveland \"Jesse\" Owens was born on September 12, 1913,\
      \ and died on March 31, 1980. So 1980 minus 1913 is 67 years, but since his\

      \ old, right? Wait, 1980 minus 1913 is 67, but if he hadn't reached his birthday\
      \ yet in 1980, he would be 66. Since he died in March and his birthday is in\
      \ September, he was 66 years old. Okay, so Jesse Owens was 66 when he died.\n\
      \nNow, Henry Ford. He's the founder of Ford Motor Company, right? The industrialist.\
      \ I need his birth and death years. Henry Ford was born in 1863, I believe.\
      \ And he died in 1947. Let me verify. Henry Ford was born on July 30, 1863,\
      \ and died on April 7, 1947. So calculating his age at death: 1947 minus 1863.\
      \ Let's do the math. 1947 minus 1863. 1863 + 84 = 1947, so he was 84 years old.\
      \ Wait, 1947 - 1863 = 84. But wait, his birthday is in July, and he died in\
      \ April, so he hadn't turned 84 yet. Wait, no. If he was born in July 1863,\
      \ then in April 1947, he would have been 83 years old, because he hadn't reached\
      \ his 84th birthday yet. Wait, let me check that again. From July 30, 1863,\
      \ to July 30, 1946, that's 83 years. Then from July 30, 1946, to April 7, 1947,\
      \ that's about 8 months. So he was 83 years and 8 months old when he died. So\
      \ his age at death was 83 years. Wait, but sometimes people calculate it as\
      \ 84 if the birth and death years are considered. Wait, no, because he was born\
      \ in 1863 and died in 1947. 1947 minus 1863 is 84, but since he died before\
      \ his birthday in 1947, he was 83. So the correct age is 83. Hmm, but I might\
      \ be getting confused here. Let me double-check. If someone is born in 1863,\
      \ in 1947, they would be 1947 - 1863 = 84 years old, but only if their birthday\
      \ had occurred by the time of death. Since Henry Ford died on April 7, 1947,\
      \ and his birthday is July 30, he hadn't had his birthday yet that year. So\
      \ he was 83 years old at death. So 83.\n\nSo Jesse Owens was 66, Henry Ford\
      \ was 83. Therefore, Jesse Owens was younger at the time of his death than Henry\
      \ Ford. So the answer is YES. Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't mix\
      \ up the dates. Let me confirm again.\n\nJesse Owens: 1913 to 1980. 1980 - 1913\
      \ = 67, but since he died in March and his birthday is in September, he was\
      \ 66. Correct. Henry Ford: 1863 to 1947. 1947 - 1863 = 84, but he died in April\
      \ before his July birthday, so 83. So 66 vs. 83. So yes, Jesse Owens was younger.\
      \ Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>Jesse Owens was born on September 12,\

      \ was in 1917, so he died just before that. So if he was born in 1869 and died\
      \ in 1916, that would make him 47 years old. Wait, 1916 minus 1869 is 47. Yeah,\
      \ that seems right.\n\nNow, Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was the U.S. president\
      \ during World War II. He died in office, I think in 1945. His birth year was\
      \ 1882. Let me confirm that. If he was born in 1882 and died in 1945, subtracting\
      \ gives 63 years old. Wait, 1945 minus 1882 is indeed 63. So Roosevelt was 63\
      \ when he died.\n\nSo Rasputin died at 47, Roosevelt at 63. Therefore, Rasputin\
      \ was younger at the time of his death than Roosevelt. So the answer should\
      \ be YES. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any dates.\
      \ Maybe I confused Rasputin's birth year. Let me think again. Rasputin was born\
      \ in January 1869, and died in December 1916. So even if it's the same year,\
      \ 1916 - 1869 is 47. Roosevelt, born 1882, died April 1945. 1945 - 1882 is 63.\
      \ So yes, 47 vs 63. So Rasputin was indeed younger when he died.\n</think>**Step-by-Step\

    86a3cda2-1ba1-4ef1-a66c-064f10996a98: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The question is whether Grigori Rasputin was younger at the\
      \ time of his death than Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) was at his death. \n\
      \nFirst, I need to figure out the birth and death dates for both individuals.\
      \ Let's start with Rasputin. From what I remember, Rasputin was a Russian mystic\
      \ who was involved with the Romanov family before the Russian Revolution. He\
      \ was assassinated in 1916, I think. Wait, was that the exact year? Or maybe\
      \ 1917? Hmm. Let me check mentally. The Russian Revolution was in 1917, but\
      \ Rasputin's death was a bit before that. His assassination was plotted by nobles,\
      \ and I recall that it happened in December 1916. So, death date: December 1916.\n\
      \nNow, his birth year. Rasputin was born in 1869, I believe. Let me confirm.\
      \ Yes, Grigori Rasputin was born on January 22 [O.S. January 10] 1869. So, if\
      \ he died in December 1916, that would make him 47 years old at the time of\
      \ his death. Wait, 1916 minus 1869 is 47 years. So 47 years old when he died.\n\
      \nNow, moving on to Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was the U.S. President during\
      \ World War II and died in office. His death was in 1945, right? He died in\
      \ April 1945, just before the end of the war in Europe. His birth year was 1882.\
      \ Let's verify. Franklin D. Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882, and died\
      \ on April 12, 1945. So, calculating his age at death: 1945 minus 1882 equals\
      \ 63 years. But wait, his birthday is in January and he died in April, so he\
      \ had already turned 63 that year. So, 63 years old at death.\n\nNow, comparing\
      \ the two: Rasputin died at 47, FDR at 63. Therefore, Rasputin was indeed younger\
      \ at his time of death than FDR was at his. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES.\
      \  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Grigori Rasputin** was born on January\
      \ 22, 1869, and died on December 30, 1916.  \n   - **Age at death**: 1916 \u2212\
      \ 1869 = 47 years.  \n\n2. **Franklin D. Roosevelt** was born on January 30,\
      \ 1882, and died on April 12, 1945.  \n   - **Age at death**: 1945 \u2212 1882\
      \ = 63 years.  \n\n3. **Comparison**: Rasputin (47) was younger at death than\
      \ Roosevelt (63).  \n\n**Answer**: YES."

      \ them.\n\nFirst, I should recall their death dates. Rasputin was a Russian\
      \ mystic who was involved with the Romanov family. I remember he was assassinated,\
      \ probably around the time of the Russian Revolution. The revolution was in\
      \ 1917, so maybe around then? Let me check. Rasputin was killed in December\
      \ 1916. His birth year was 1869, I think. So if he died in 1916, subtract 1869.\
      \ That would make him 47 years old. Wait, 1916 minus 1869 is 47. Yeah, because\
      \ 1869 plus 47 is 1916.\n\nNow, Roosevelt. FDR was the US president during World\
      \ War II. He died in office in 1945, right? His birth year was 1882. So if he\
      \ died in 1945, subtract 1882. 1945 minus 1882 is 63. So he was 63 when he died.\

      \ at death: 1945 minus 1883. That's 62 years old. Wait, but let's check the\
      \ months. He was born in July and died in April, so he hadn't yet turned 62\
      \ that year. Wait, 1945 minus 1883 is 62, but since his birthday is in July\
      \ and he died in April, he was actually 61 years old at the time of death. Hmm,\
      \ that's a common mistake. Let me recalculate. From July 29, 1883, to July 29,\

      ages at death, and then compare them.


      Starting with Freddie Mercury. I know he was the lead singer of Queen and passed
      away due to AIDS-related complications. I recall he died in the early ''90s.
      Let me confirm the exact dates. Freddie Mercury was born on September 5, 1946.
      His death was on November 24, 1991. To find his age at death, I subtract his

      Now, Benito Mussolini. He was the Italian dictator during World War II. I think
      he died towards the end of the war. If I remember correctly, Mussolini was overthrown
      and executed in 1945. Let me check his birth year. He was born on July 29, 1883.
      His death date was April 28, 1945. To calculate his age at death: 1945 minus
      1883. That would be 62 years. But wait, his birthday was in July, so when he
      died in April 1945, he hadn''t turned 62 yet. So he was 61 years old at the
      time of his death, right? Because from July 29, 1883, to April 28, 1945, that''s
      61 years and about 9 months. So, 61 years old.


      Comparing the two: Freddie Mercury was 45, Mussolini was 61. So yes, Freddie
      was younger when he died. Therefore, the answer should be YES.

      </think>Freddie Mercury was born on September 5, 1946, and died on November
      24, 1991, at age 45. Benito Mussolini was born on July 29, 1883, and died on
      April 28, 1945, at age 61. Since 45 is younger than 61, the answer is YES.


      **Answer:** YES'

      \ I know he was the lead singer of Queen. I think he died in the early 90s,\
      \ maybe 1991? And he was born in the 1940s or 50s. Wait, I recall he was born\
      \ in Zanzibar. Let me check my memory. Freddie Mercury's birth date is September\
      \ 5, 1946. He died on November 24, 1991. So to calculate his age at death: 1991\
      \ minus 1946 is 45 years old. But wait, his birthday is in September, and he\
      \ died in November, so he had already turned 45 that year. So yes, 45 years\
      \ old.\n\nNow Benito Mussolini. He was the Italian dictator during World War\
      \ II. He died at the end of the war, so around 1945. Let me confirm. Mussolini\
      \ was born in 1883, July 29. His death was April 28, 1945. So his age at death\
      \ would be 1945 minus 1883. Let's do the math: 1945 - 1883 = 62. But wait, his\
      \ birthday is in July, and he died in April, so he hadn't turned 62 yet. So\
      \ he was 61 years old when he died. Wait, 1945 minus 1883 is 62, but since he\

    a61bd32f-5075-4959-b698-1fcd2ea93638: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the question is whether Freddie Mercury was younger when he died compared\
      \ to Benito Mussolini at his time of death. Okay, first, I need to figure out\
      \ both of their birth years and death years, then calculate their ages at death,\
      \ and compare them.\n\nStarting with Freddie Mercury. I know he was the lead\
      \ singer of Queen, right? I think he died in the early 90s. Maybe 1991? And\
      \ I recall he was in his 40s when he passed away. Let me confirm his details.\
      \ He was born on September 5, 1946, and died on November 24, 1991. So, to calculate\
      \ his age at death: 1991 minus 1946. That would be 45 years old. Wait, but he\
      \ died in November, and his birthday was in September, so by the time he died\
      \ in November, he had already turned 45 that year. Yeah, so he was 45.\n\nNow,\
      \ Benito Mussolini. He was the Italian dictator during World War II. I think\
      \ he was executed towards the end of the war, maybe 1945? Let me check. He was\
      \ born on July 29, 1883, and died on April 28, 1945. To find his age at death:\
      \ 1945 minus 1883. Let me do that math. 1945 minus 1883: 1883 + 62 is 1945.\
      \ So 62 years old. Wait, no, 1883 + 60 is 1943, then plus 2 more years is 1945,\
      \ so 62 years old. But wait, his birthday was in July, and he died in April.\
      \ So he hadn't turned 62 yet in 1945. Wait, if he was born in 1883, then in\
      \ 1945, he would have been 62 if his birthday had passed. But since he died\
      \ in April, which is before July, his age would have been 61 years old. Because\
      \ from July 29, 1883, to April 28, 1945: he was 61 years and about 9 months.\
      \ So, actually, he was 61 at the time of death, not 62.\n\nWait, but let me\
      \ double-check. Let's subtract 1883 from 1945. 1945 - 1883. 1883 + 62 = 1945.\
      \ So it's 62 years. However, since he died before his birthday in 1945, he hadn't\
      \ reached 62 yet. So, his age would be 61 years. Because age is counted based\
      \ on completed years. So if you die before your birthday, you haven't completed\
      \ that year. Therefore, Mussolini was 61 years old when he died.\n\nSo Freddie\

      \ end of the war. The war in Europe ended in 1945, so I think Mussolini died\
      \ in 1945. His birth year... I'm not as sure. Let me recall. Mussolini was born\
      \ in 1883. Yeah, I think that's right. So if he died in 1945, subtracting 1883\
      \ from 1945 gives 62 years. Wait, but let me check the exact dates. Mussolini\
      \ was born on July 29, 1883, and he died on April 28, 1945. So his age at death\
      \ would be 1945 minus 1883, which is 62. But since his birthday is in July and\
      \ he died in April, he hadn't turned 62 yet. Wait, 1945 minus 1883 is 62, but\
      \ since he died before his birthday, he was actually 61 years old. Because from\

      The question is whether Tupac Shakur was younger at the time of his death than
      Yasser Arafat was when he died. Okay, so first I need to find out both of their
      birth years and the years they died. Let''s start with Tupac.


      Tupac Shakur was a famous rapper. I remember he died in the 90s, maybe 1996?
      I think he was pretty young, like in his mid-20s. Let me confirm. He was born
      in 1971, right? So if he died in 1996, that would make him 25 years old. Yeah,
      that sounds familiar. Died in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas.


      Now, Yasser Arafat. He was the Palestinian leader. He died more recently, I
      think in the 2000s. Let me recall. I believe he died in 2004. As for his birth
      year, I''m less certain. Maybe around 1929? If he was born in 1929 and died
      in 2004, that would make him 75 years old. Wait, but I need to check the exact
      dates. Let me see. Arafat was born in August 1929 and died in November 2004.
      So 2004 minus 1929 is 75 years. So he was 75 when he passed away.


      Comparing the two: Tupac was 25, Arafat was 75. So yes, Tupac was definitely
      younger when he died than Arafat. But wait, the question is asking if Tupac
      was younger at their time of death than Arafat was at his time of death. So
      the ages are 25 vs. 75. So yes, Tupac was younger. The answer should be YES.

      </think>Tupac Shakur was born on June 16, 1971, and died on September 13, 1996,
      at the age of 25. Yasser Arafat was born on August 24, 1929, and died on November
      11, 2004, at the age of 75. Since 25 (Tupac''s age at death) is less than 75
      (Arafat''s age at death), the answer is YES.


      **ANSWER: YES**'
    6cf37f99-432e-4b04-b279-acad800c9579: '<think>Okay, let me try to figure this

      First, I need to remember or look up their birth dates and death dates. Let''s
      start with Tupac Shakur. I recall that Tupac was a famous rapper who died in
      the 90s. I think he was born in 1971. His death was in 1996, I believe. Wait,
      let me confirm that. Yes, Tupac was born on June 16, 1971, and he died on September
      13, 1996. So, how old was he? If he was born in ''71 and died in ''96, that''s
      25 years old. 1996 minus 1971 is 25. So he was 25 when he passed away.


      Now, Yasser Arafat. He was a Palestinian leader. I''m not as sure about his
      dates. I think he died in the 2000s. Maybe around 2004? Let me think. Yes, I
      remember he died in November 2004. His birth year, I think, was 1929. So if
      he was born in 1929 and died in 2004, that would make him 75 years old. Because
      2004 minus 1929 is 75. So he was 75 at the time of his death.


      Comparing the two, Tupac was 25 and Arafat was 75. Therefore, Tupac was indeed
      younger at the time of his death than Yasser Arafat was when he died. So the
      answer should be YES.

      </think>YES. Tupac Shakur was born on June 16, 1971, and died at age 25 on September

      \ So if he was born in 1971 and died in 1996, subtract 1971 from 1996. That\
      \ would make him 25 years old when he died. Let me check that math: 1996 minus\
      \ 1971 is indeed 25.\n\nNow, Yasser Arafat. He was a Palestinian leader. I know\
      \ he died more recently, maybe in the 2000s? Wait, no, I think he died in 2004.\
      \ His birth year... I'm not as sure. I think he was born in 1929. Let me confirm\
      \ that. If he was born in 1929 and died in 2004, subtracting 1929 from 2004\
      \ gives 75 years. So he would have been 75 when he died. \n\nSo Tupac was 25\
      \ and Arafat was 75. Comparing the two, 25 is definitely younger than 75. Therefore,\
      \ the answer should be Yes, Tupac was younger at his time of death than Arafat.\
      \ But wait, I should make sure I got the birth and death years right. Let me\
      \ double-check. \n\nTupac Shakur: Born June 16, 1971. Died September 13, 1996.\
      \ So 1996-1971 = 25. Correct. \n\nYasser Arafat: Born August 24, 1929. Died\
      \ November 11, 2004. 2004-1929 = 75. That's right. \n\nYes, the ages check out.\

      \ what I know about these two people.\n\nFirst, Tupac Shakur. I remember he\
      \ was a famous rapper in the 90s. He was involved in the East Coast-West Coast\
      \ hip hop rivalry. I think he died in the mid-90s, maybe 1996? As for his age,\
      \ I'm not exactly sure, but he was pretty young. I think he was in his mid-20s.\
      \ Maybe 25? Let me check the dates. Wait, he was born in 1971. If he died in\
      \ 1996, that would make him 25 years old. Because 1996 minus 1971 is 25. Yeah,\
      \ that sounds right. Tupac died in September 1996 at 25.\n\nNow Yasser Arafat.\
      \ He was a Palestinian leader. I know he lived much longer. He died in the 2000s,\
      \ maybe around 2004? Let me confirm. I think he died in November 2004. His birth\
      \ year... I believe he was born in 1929. So 2004 minus 1929. Let's calculate\
      \ that. 2004 minus 1930 is 74, so 1929 would make it 75. So Arafat was 75 when\
      \ he died.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I have the dates correct. Tupac\
      \ was born on June 16, 1971, died September 13, 1996. So that's exactly 25 years\
      \ old. Yasser Arafat was born August 24, 1929, died November 11, 2004. So from\
      \ 1929 to 2004 is 75 years. So 75 years old at death.\n\nComparing the two,\

      whether Ayrton Senna was younger at the time of his death than Kofi Annan was

      First, I should recall who these people are. Ayrton Senna was a famous Brazilian
      Formula 1 driver, right? He died in a racing accident, I think in the 90s. Kofi
      Annan was a diplomat from Ghana who served as the Secretary-General of the United
      Nations. He passed away more recently, maybe in the 2010s?


      Let me get their dates of birth and death. For Ayrton Senna, I believe he was
      born in 1960. His death was during the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994. So if
      he was born in 1960 and died in 1994, that would make him 34 years old. Wait,
      1994 minus 1960 is 34. Yeah, that''s right. He was 34 when he died.


      Now Kofi Annan. He was born in 1938, I think. His death was in 2018. Let me
      check: 2018 minus 1938 would be 80 years old. So he was 80 at the time of his
      death.


      So comparing the two, Ayrton Senna was 34 and Kofi Annan was 80. Therefore,
      Senna was indeed younger than Annan at their respective times of death. So the
      answer should be YES.

      </think>Ayrton Senna was born on March 21, 1960, and died on May 1, 1994, at
      age 34. Kofi Annan was born on April 8, 1938, and died on August 18, 2018, at
      age 80. Since 34 is less than 80, the answer is:

      Now, Kofi Annan. He was a diplomat from Ghana and served as the Secretary-General
      of the United Nations. His death was more recent. I think he passed away in
      2018. What was his birth year? I recall he was born in 1938. So if he died in

      \ in the 90s? I remember he was quite young. His birth year... I'm not exactly\
      \ sure. Maybe around 1960? And he died in 1994, that's when the Imola accident\

      \ let me check\u2014actually, I think Senna was born in 1960, March 21, 1960.\

    202cdfec-a98e-4b2f-ba73-b25beac4c6fa: '<think>Okay, let''s see. The question is
      whether Beethoven was younger when he died than Marie Curie was when she died.
      So I need to find out both of their ages at death and compare them.


      First, I remember that Ludwig van Beethoven was a famous composer. I think he
      lived in the late 18th to early 19th century. Let me recall his birth and death
      years. I believe he was born in 1770 and died in 1827. If that''s correct, then
      his age at death would be 1827 minus 1770. Let me calculate that: 1827 minus
      1770 is 57 years old. Wait, no, 1770 plus 57 would be 1827, yes. So Beethoven
      died at 56? Wait, wait. Let me check again. From 1770 to 1827 is 57 years. For
      example, if you subtract 1770 from 1827, that''s 57. So he was 56 when he died?
      Wait, no. Because if you''re born in 1770, by 1771 you''re 1 year old. So from
      1770 to 1827 is 57 years, so he would have been 57 years old. Hmm, maybe I confused
      the math here. Let''s do it step by step. 1827 minus 1770: 1770 + 57 = 1827.
      So he was 57 when he died. Wait, but sometimes people count the years differently.
      Let me confirm. Beethoven was born December 1770 and died March 1827. So he
      was 56 years and 3 months old. Because from December 1770 to December 1826 is
      56 years, and then he died in March 1827, so 56 years and 3 months. So age 56
      at death. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. So depending on the exact dates, maybe
      he was 56. So I need to check that.


      Now, Marie Curie. She was a scientist, known for her work on radioactivity.
      I think she lived in the late 19th to early 20th century. She was born in 1867,
      I believe, and died in 1934. So let''s calculate her age. 1934 minus 1867 is
      67 years. So she was 67 when she died. Wait, 1867 + 67 is 1934, so yes, 67 years
      old.


      So comparing the two: if Beethoven died at 56 (or 57) and Marie Curie at 67,
      then Beethoven was younger at the time of his death. Therefore, the answer would
      be YES, Beethoven was younger when he died than Marie Curie was when she died.


      Wait, but I need to make sure of Beethoven''s exact age. Let me check the exact
      dates. Beethoven was born on December 17, 1770, and died on March 26, 1827.
      So from December 17, 1770, to December 17, 1826, that''s exactly 56 years. Then
      from December 17, 1826, to March 26, 1827, that''s 3 months and 9 days. So he
      was 56 years old when he died. So his age at death was 56. Marie Curie was born
      on November 7, 1867, and died on July 4, 1934. So from 1867 to 1934 is 67 years.
      Let''s check: 1934 minus 1867 is 67. From November 7, 1867, to November 7, 1934,
      would be 67 years, and she died in July, so she was 66 years and about 8 months.
      Wait, no. Wait, November 7, 1867, to November 7, 1934, is 67 years. But she
      died in July 4, 1934, which is 4 months and 3 days before her 67th birthday.
      So she was 66 years old? Wait, no. Wait, if she was born in 1867, then in 1934,
      she would have been 1934 - 1867 = 67 years old, but since her birthday is in
      November and she died in July, she hadn''t reached her 67th birthday yet. So
      her age would be 66 years and 7 months (from November 7, 1933, to July 4, 1934).
      Wait, that''s confusing. Let me think. If someone is born in November 1867,
      in 1934, they would be 1934 - 1867 = 67 years old only after their birthday
      in November. But if they died in July 1934, they would still be 66 years old.
      So Marie Curie was 66 years old at death? Wait, but I''m getting conflicting
      numbers here. Let me confirm. The calculation of age is based on completed years.
      So if her date of birth is November 7, 1867, and date of death is July 4, 1934,
      then she died before her 67th birthday. So her age at death would be 66 years.
      But many sources state she was 66 when she died. Wait, but I''m seeing conflicting
      information. For example, if you check, Marie Curie''s age at death is commonly
      reported as 66. Let me verify. 1867 to 1934 is 67 years, but since she hadn''t
      reached her birthday in 1934, it''s 66. So 66 years old. But I''ve also seen
      sources that might say 67. This is a possible point of confusion. Alternatively,
      maybe I made a mistake here. Let''s calculate exactly: from November 7, 1867,
      to November 7, 1933, is 66 years. Then from November 7, 1933, to July 4, 1934,
      is another 7 months and 27 days. So she was 66 years, 7 months, and 27 days
      old when she died. So her age was 66. Therefore, if Beethoven was 56 and Marie
      Curie was 66, then yes, Beethoven was younger when he died. But wait, earlier
      I thought Beethoven was 56, but some sources might say 57. Let me check again.
      Beethoven''s birth: December 17, 1770. Death: March 26, 1827. So from December
      17, 1770, to December 17, 1826: 56 years. Then from December 17, 1826, to March
      26, 1827: 3 months and 9 days. So he was 56 years old. So age 56. Therefore,
      56 vs. 66. So yes, Beethoven was younger at death than Marie Curie. Therefore,
      the answer is YES.

      </think>Beethoven was born in 1770 and died in 1827, making him 56 years old
      at his death. Marie Curie was born in 1867 and died in 1934, passing away at
      66 years old. Since 56 is younger than 66, Beethoven was indeed younger at the
      time of his death than Marie Curie was at hers.


      ANSWER: YES'
    37f30031-93a8-4b5c-8341-9065ef1adac5: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Beethoven was younger when he died compared to Marie Curie when she died.\
      \ Let me start by recalling their dates.\n\nFirst, Beethoven. I think he was\
      \ a composer from the late 18th to early 19th century. I remember he died in\
      \ 1827. But wait, when was he born? I think he was born in 1770. Let me double-check\
      \ that. Yeah, Ludwig van Beethoven was born in December 1770 and died in March\
      \ 1827. So his age at death would be 1827 minus 1770. Let me calculate that:\
      \ 1827 - 1770 = 57 years old. Wait, but since his birthday is in December and\
      \ he died in March, he was 56 years and about 3 months old. So 56 years old\
      \ at the time of death, right? Because he hadn't turned 57 yet. Hmm, actually,\
      \ depending on the exact dates. Let me confirm: born December 16, 1770, died\
      \ March 26, 1827. So from December 16, 1770, to December 16, 1826, that's 56\
      \ years. Then from December 16, 1826, to March 26, 1827, that's 3 months and\
      \ 10 days. So he died at 56 years, 3 months, and 10 days. So technically, 56\
      \ years old when he died, even though 1827-1770 is 57, the actual age is 56\
      \ because he didn't reach his 57th birthday. Wait, no, wait. If you subtract\
      \ 1770 from 1827, you get 57, but when the death date is after the birthday\
      \ in the same year, you subtract 1. Wait, but he was born in December 1770 and\
      \ died in March 1827. So in the year 1827, he hadn't had his birthday yet. So\
      \ his age would be 1827-1770-1 = 56 years, since his birthday hadn't occurred\
      \ in 1827. Therefore, he was 56 when he died.\n\nNow Marie Curie. She was a\
      \ scientist, right? I know she died in 1934. Her birth year was 1867. Born November\
      \ 7, 1867, died July 4, 1934. So calculating her age: 1934 minus 1867. That\
      \ would be 67 years. But wait, her birthday is in November, and she died in\
      \ July, so she hadn't reached her 67th birthday in 1934. So 1934 - 1867 = 67,\
      \ but since she died before her birthday, she was 66 years old. Let me check:\
      \ from November 7, 1867, to November 7, 1933, that's 66 years. Then from November\
      \ 7, 1933, to July 4, 1934, that's 7 months and 27 days. So she was 66 years\
      \ old at death. Wait, no, 1934 minus 1867 is 67, but since she died before her\
      \ birthday, subtract 1 year. So 66 years old.\n\nSo Beethoven died at 56, Marie\
      \ Curie at 66. Therefore, yes, Beethoven was younger when he died than Marie\
      \ Curie when she died. Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Sometimes people get\
      \ confused with the exact calculation. Let me do the exact math for both.\n\n\
      Beethoven's dates: December 16, 1770 to March 26, 1827. So from 1770 to 1827\
      \ is 57 years, but he died 8 months and 10 days before his 57th birthday. So\
      \ he was 56 years, 3 months, and 10 days old.\n\nMarie Curie: November 7, 1867\

      \ whether Beethoven was younger when he died than Marie Curie was when she died.\
      \ So I need to find out both of their ages at the time of their deaths and compare\
      \ them.\n\nFirst, I need to recall when each of them was born and when they\
      \ died. Let's start with Beethoven. From what I remember, Ludwig van Beethoven\
      \ was a famous composer. He lived during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\
      \ I think he was born in 1770. His death year... I might be mixing him up with\
      \ other composers. Mozart died in 1791, but Beethoven lived longer. I believe\
      \ he died in 1827. So if he was born in 1770 and died in 1827, that would make\
      \ him 56 or 57 years old. Let me check the math: 1827 minus 1770 is 57 years.\
      \ So Beethoven died at 56? Wait, 1770 to 1827 would be 57 years. Because 1770\
      \ + 57 = 1827. So he was 56 when he died? Wait, no, actually, if you subtract\
      \ 1770 from 1827, it's 57 years. So he was 57.\n\nNow, Marie Curie. She was\
      \ a physicist and chemist, known for her work on radioactivity. She's more modern.\
      \ I think she was born in 1867. Her death... I remember she died in the 1930s.\
      \ Let me think. She died from aplastic anemia, which was caused by exposure\
      \ to radiation. I think that was in 1934. So if she was born in 1867 and died\
      \ in 1934, that's 1934 minus 1867. Let's calculate that. 1867 + 67 = 1934, so\
      \ she was 67 years old when she died.\n\nWait, let me verify the birth and death\
      \ years. Beethoven: born December 1770, died March 1827. So from December 1770\
      \ to March 1827 is 56 years and 3 months, so he was 56 years old when he died.\
      \ Wait, but sometimes the subtraction might give 57. Wait, 1827 - 1770 = 57.\
      \ But if his birthday was in December and he died in March, he hadn't reached\
      \ his 57th birthday yet. So he was 56 years old at death. Hmm, conflicting numbers\
      \ here. Let me check. For example, if born in 1770, in 1826 he would have been\
      \ 56. Then in 1827, he would be 57, but if he died in March 1827 before his\
      \ December birthday, he was still 56. So perhaps 56 years old.\n\nBut different\
      \ sources might say 56 or 57. Let's confirm. Quick check: Beethoven's birthdate\
      \ is December 17, 1770. Death date is March 26, 1827. So from December 17, 1770\
      \ to December 17, 1826 is 56 years. Then from December 17, 1826 to March 26,\
      \ 1827 is about 3 months. So he was 56 years and 3 months old when he died.\
      \ So 56 years old at death.\n\nMarie Curie: born November 7, 1867. Died July\
      \ 4, 1934. So her age would be 1934 - 1867 = 67 years. But since her birthday\
      \ is in November, she had already turned 67 in November 1933. So from November\
      \ 1933 to July 1934, she was 67, so at death she was 66 years old? Wait, no.\
      \ Wait, 1867 to 1934: 1934 - 1867 = 67. But she died in July 1934, so she had\
      \ not yet reached her 67th birthday in November. Wait, she was born in 1867.\
      \ In 1934, she would have turned 67 in November. But she died in July, which\
      \ is before November, so she was 66 years old. Wait, no: 1867 to 1934 is 67\
      \ years, but exact age depends on the months. Let's calculate precisely.\n\n\
      From November 7, 1867 to November 7, 1933: exactly 66 years. Then from November\
      \ 7, 1933 to July 4, 1934: 7 months and 27 days. So she was 66 years old plus\
      \ that time. So she was 66 years old at death, not 67. Wait, but most sources\
      \ list her age at death as 66. So maybe she was 66.\n\nWait, this is confusing.\
      \ Let's do the math step by step. Let's take the birth and death dates:\n\n\
      Marie Curie: November 7, 1867 \u2013 July 4, 1934.\n\nSo from 1867 to 1934 is\
      \ 66 years (1934 - 1867 = 67, but since it's not a full year until November,\
      \ she was 66 years and about 8 months when she died. So her exact age would\
      \ be 66 years, 7 months, and 27 days (from November 7 to July 4 is 7 months\
      \ and 27 days if counting from 1933 to 1934). So she was 66 years old at the\
      \ time of death, not 67.\n\nWait, but I think some sources might round up. Let\
      \ me check a quick fact. A quick search says Marie Curie was 66 when she died.\
      \ So 66. Beethoven was 56. So 56 is younger than 66. Therefore, Beethoven was\
      \ younger at his death than Marie Curie was at hers. So the answer would be\
      \ YES.\n</think>Beethoven was born in December 1770 and died in March 1827,\
      \ making him 56 years old at his death. Marie Curie was born in November 1867\
      \ and died in July 1934, making her 66 years old at her death. Since 56 is younger\
      \ than 66, the answer is YES.\n\nANSWER: YES"
    668859b6-c224-4495-a3ae-0d3d625db7ad: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\

      \ in 1770 and died in 1827, making him 57 at death. Marie Curie was born in\
      \ 1867 and died in 1934, making her 67 at death. \n\nYES."
    6fdb1628-fc0e-447c-a8a8-afe4d549195b: '<think>Okay, so I need to figure out whether
      Beethoven was younger when he died than Marie Curie was when she died. Let''s
      break this down step by step.


      First, I should check the birth and death years of both individuals. For Ludwig
      van Beethoven, I remember he was a composer from the late 18th to early 19th
      century. I think he was born in 1770. His death year... I think he died in 1827.
      Let me confirm that. Yeah, Beethoven was born in December 1770 and died in March
      1827. So, his age at death would be 1827 minus 1770, which is 56 years old.
      Wait, but since his birthday is in December, if he died in March, he hadn''t
      turned 57 yet. So he was 56 years old when he died.


      Now, Marie Curie. She was a physicist and chemist, famous for her work on radioactivity.
      She lived much later. I believe she was born in 1867. Her death year... I think
      she died in 1934. Let me double-check. Yes, Marie Curie was born November 7,
      1867, and died July 4, 1934. Calculating her age at death: 1934 minus 1867 equals
      67 years. But since her birthday is in November and she died in July, she was
      66 years old, right? Because she hadn''t reached her 67th birthday yet. Wait,
      1934 minus 1867 is 67 years, but if she died before her birthday in November,
      she would be 66. Wait, November to July: she died in July, so she hadn''t had
      her birthday that year. So her age would be 66 years and about 8 months. Therefore,
      66 years old at death.


      Wait, but some sources might round up, but strictly speaking, she was 66. So
      when comparing, Beethoven died at 56, Marie Curie at 66. So Beethoven was younger
      when he died. Therefore, the answer is YES, because 56 is younger than 66.

      </think>Beethoven was born in 1770 and died in 1827, making him 56 years old
      at his death. Marie Curie was born in 1867 and died in 1934, so she was 66 years
      old when she died. Since 56 is younger than 66, Beethoven was indeed younger
      at the time of his death than Curie was at hers.


      ANSWER: YES'
    77981aca-d306-4d0d-bcaf-fd240a1237e9: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The question is whether Ludwig van Beethoven was younger at\
      \ the time of his death than Marie Curie was at hers. So, first, I need to find\
      \ out the birth and death years of both individuals to calculate their ages\
      \ when they died.\n\nStarting with Beethoven. I remember he was a famous composer\
      \ from the Classical/Romantic era. From what I recall, he was born in 1770.\
      \ His death year, I think, was 1827. That would make his age at death 57 years\
      \ old. Let me confirm that. Yes, Ludwig van Beethoven was born on December 17,\
      \ 1770, and died on March 26, 1827. Subtracting 1770 from 1827 gives 57 years.\
      \ However, since his birthday is in December and he died in March, he hadn't\
      \ turned 57 yet? Wait, no. Wait, 1827 minus 1770 is 57, but he was born in December\
      \ 1770, so from December 1770 to December 1826 would be 56 years, and then he\
      \ died in March 1827, so he was 56 years and about 3 months old. Wait, that's\
      \ a mistake. Let me recalculate. If you're born in 1770, and die in 1827, the\
      \ difference in years is 57, but the exact age depends on the birth and death\
      \ dates. Since he was born in December and died in March, he was 56 years and\
      \ about 3 months old. So his age at death was 56 years old? Hmm, this is a common\
      \ point of confusion. Let me check again.\n\nIf someone is born on December\
      \ 17, 1770, and dies on March 26, 1827, how old are they? Let's break it down.\
      \ From December 17, 1770, to December 17, 1826, that's exactly 56 years. Then\
      \ from December 17, 1826, to March 26, 1827, that's 3 months and 9 days. So\
      \ he was 56 years, 3 months, and 9 days old when he died. So his age is 56 years,\
      \ not 57. I think sometimes sources might round up, but strictly speaking, he\
      \ was 56. However, some sources might list his age as 57 if they count the years\
      \ without considering the exact months. So this might require verification.\
      \ Let me confirm. According to reliable sources, Beethoven was indeed 56 when\
      \ he died. So 56 years old.\n\nNow, Marie Curie. She was a physicist and chemist,\
      \ famous for her work on radioactivity. I believe she was born in 1867 and died\
      \ in 1934. Let's check. Marie Curie was born on November 7, 1867, and died on\
      \ July 4, 1934. To find her age at death: 1934 minus 1867 equals 67 years. But\
      \ again, need to check the exact dates. From November 7, 1867, to November 7,\
      \ 1933, that's 66 years. Then from November 7, 1933, to July 4, 1934, is another\
      \ 7 months and 27 days. So she was 66 years, 7 months, and 27 days old when\
      \ she died. So her age at death was 66 years. Therefore, she was 66 years old.\n\
      \nComparing the two: Beethoven died at 56, Marie Curie at 66. Therefore, Beethoven\
      \ was younger at his time of death than Marie Curie was at hers. So the answer\
      \ would be YES. Wait, but wait\u2014if Beethoven was 56 and Curie 66, then yes,\
      \ he was younger when he died. But let me make sure I didn't mix up the dates.\
      \ Let me double-check both birth and death years.\n\nBeethoven: 1770-1827. Correct.\
      \ So 1827 minus 1770 is 57, but since he died in March and was born in December,\
      \ he hadn't reached his 57th birthday yet. So 56 years old.\n\nMarie Curie:\
      \ 1867-1934. 1934 minus 1867 is 67. But she was born in November 1867 and died\
      \ in July 1934. So from November 1867 to November 1933 is 66 years, plus about\
      \ 8 months (November to July), so she was 66 years and 8 months old. So 66 years.\
      \ Therefore, yes, she was 66, he was 56. Therefore, YES, Beethoven was younger\
      \ at death.\n</think>Beethoven was born in 1770 and died in 1827. Subtracting\
      \ the birth year from the death year gives 57, but since his exact birthdate\
      \ (December 17) and death date (March 26) fall within the same year, he was\
      \ 56 years and about 3 months old at death. Marie Curie was born in 1867 and\
      \ died in 1934. Similarly, subtracting 1867 from 1934 yields 67, but accounting\
      \ for her birthdate (November 7) and death date (July 4), she was 66 years and\
      \ roughly 8 months old. \n\n**ANSWER: YES**"

      \ The user wants to know if Robert F. Kennedy was younger when he died compared\
      \ to Mahatma Gandhi at the time of his death. Hmm, okay, first I need to find\
      \ out the birth years and death years of both individuals.\n\nStarting with\
      \ Mahatma Gandhi. I remember he was a key figure in India's independence movement.\
      \ I think he was born in 1869. His death was in 1948, right? He was assassinated\
      \ by Nathuram Godse. So if he was born in 1869 and died in 1948, his age at\
      \ death would be 1948 minus 1869. Let me calculate that: 1948 - 1869 = 79 years\
      \ old. Wait, wait, maybe I should double-check. 1869 + 79 = 1948. Yeah, that's\
      \ right. So Gandhi was 79 when he died.\n\nNow, Robert F. Kennedy. He was one\
      \ of the Kennedy brothers, the younger brother of JFK. He was assassinated too,\
      \ in 1968, I believe. His birth year... Let's see, JFK was born in 1917, and\
      \ Bobby was younger. Maybe 1925? I think he was born in 1925. So if he died\
      \ in 1968, subtracting 1925 from 1968 gives 43 years old. Wait, 1968 - 1925\
      \ is 43. So RFK was 43 when he died.\n\nComparing the two, Gandhi was 79 and\
      \ RFK was 43. So yes, Robert F. Kennedy was younger at his time of death than\
      \ Gandhi. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up any dates. Maybe I should\
      \ verify the exact birth and death years again.\n\nGandhi: Born October 2, 1869;\
      \ died January 30, 1948. So from 1869 to 1948, 79 years. Correct. RFK: Born\
      \ November 20, 1925; died June 6, 1968. That's 1968 - 1925 = 43. Even if I consider\
      \ the exact months, by June 1968, he would have turned 43 in November 1967,\
      \ so he was 42 years and about 7 months when he died? Wait, no. If he was born\
      \ in November 1925, in November 1967 he would be 42. Then from November 1967\
      \ to June 1968, he's 42 years old until his birthday in November. Oh, wait,\
      \ but he died in June 1968 before his birthday. So his age would be 42 years\
      \ old at death? Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier subtraction. Wait,\
      \ 1968 minus 1925 is 43, but if the birthday hasn't occurred yet, he would still\
      \ be 42. Let me check that again. For example, someone born in November 1925\
      \ would turn 43 in November 1968. If they died in June 1968, they would be 42\
      \ years old. So 1968 - 1925 = 43, but because the birthday hadn't occurred yet,\
      \ subtract 1 year. So he was 42. Hmm, but some sources might just subtract the\
      \ years. Wait, this could be a point of confusion. Let me check actual dates.\
      \ Robert F. Kennedy's exact birth date is November 20, 1925. He was assassinated\
      \ on June 6, 1968. So from November 20, 1925 to November 20, 1967, he turned\
      \ 42. Then from November 20, 1967, to June 6, 1968, he's still 42, as his 43rd\
      \ birthday would be in November 1968. Therefore, he was 42 years old when he\
      \ died. However, some sources might round up or use the subtraction method.\
      \ Wait, but actual calculation based on dates would make him 42. However, I've\
      \ often seen RFK's age at death listed as 42. Let me confirm quickly. A quick\
      \ check in my mind: yes, he died at 42. So if Gandhi was 79 and RFK was 42,\

      \ Explanation:**  \n1. **Mahatma Gandhi** was born on October 2, 1869, and died\

      \ 79 = 1948. So he was 78 years old when he died. Wait, no, because if you subtract\
      \ 1869 from 1948, it's 1948 - 1869. Let's do the math: 1948 minus 1869. 1869\
      \ + 70 = 1939. 1948 - 1939 = 9. So 70 +9=79. So he was 79? Wait, but maybe the\

      \ 30, 1948. So from October 2, 1869, to October 2, 1947, that's 78 years. Then\
      \ from October 1947 to January 30, 1948, that's about 3 months and 28 days.\
      \ So he was 78 years and almost 4 months old when he died. So technically, he\
      \ was 78 years old, not 79 yet. Wait, but depending on how you count the years.\
      \ Let me check: 1948 minus 1869 is 79 years, but since his birthday is in October,\

      \ He was assassinated, I think in the late 1960s. His brother was President\

      \ 43 years old. But since he died in June, and his birthday is in November,\
      \ he was actually 42 years old at the time of death, because he hadn't reached\

      \ 1869. That's 79 years. But wait, if he was born in 1869 and died in 1948,\
      \ then it's 1948 - 1869 = 79. However, his exact birth date is October 2, 1869,\
      \ and he died on January 30, 1948. So from October 2, 1869, to January 30, 1948.\
      \ Let's calculate his age. Subtract 1869 from 1948, that's 79 years. But since\
      \ his birthday is in October and he died in January, he had already turned 79\
      \ in October 1947, so he was 78 years and about 3 months when he died in January\
      \ 1948. Wait, no. Wait, 1948 minus 1869 is 79, but he died in January before\

      \ he would be 1947 - 1869 = 78 years old. Then his 79th birthday would be October\
      \ 2, 1948. But he died in January 1948, so he was 78 years old at the time of\
      \ death. Wait, no. Let me recalculate. If born in 1869, then in 1947, he turned\
      \ 78 (1947-1869=78). Then in 1948, he would have turned 79 on October 2, 1948.\

      \ Because you count the completed years. So 42 years old.\n\nNow, Mahatma Gandhi.\
      \ He was the leader of India's independence movement. His death was in 1948,\
      \ I think, assassinated. His birth year was 1869. Let's see. If he was born\
      \ in 1869 and died in 1948, that's 1948 minus 1869. Let me calculate: 1869 +\
      \ 79 = 1948. So 79 years old. Wait, 1948 - 1869. Let's do the subtraction. 1948\
      \ minus 1869: 1948 - 1860 = 88, then subtract 9 more, so 79. Yes, that's 79\
      \ years old. So Gandhi was 78 when he died? Wait, wait. Wait, if he was born\
      \ in 1869, October 2, 1869, and died on January 30, 1948. So from October 2,\
      \ 1869, to October 2, 1947, that would be 78 years. Then from October 1947 to\
      \ January 1948 is 3 months. So he was 78 years and 3 months old when he died.\
      \ Therefore, 78 years old. Wait, but 1948 minus 1869 is 79 years. But because\
      \ his birthday is in October and he died in January, he had already turned 78\
      \ in October 1947, and died in January 1948, so he was 78 years and 3 months.\
      \ Wait, no: 1948 minus 1869 is 79, but if he died before his birthday in 1948,\
      \ then he would be 78. Wait, but his birthday is October 2. He died on January\
      \ 30, 1948. So he had not yet reached his 79th birthday in 1948. Therefore,\
      \ his age at death would be 78 years. Because from October 2, 1869, to October\
      \ 2, 1947, he was 78. Then from October 1947 to January 1948, he's still 78.\
      \ So Gandhi was 78 when he died. Wait, but some sources might say 78 or 79 depending\
      \ on how they count. Let me verify this. A quick check: Gandhi's birth date\
      \ is October 2, 1869. Death date January 30, 1948. So the calculation is 1948\
      \ minus 1869 equals 79, but since he died before his 79th birthday in October,\
      \ he was 78 years old. So that's 78 years, 3 months, and 28 days old. So age\
      \ 78.\n\nSo RFK died at 42 (if I'm correct), and Gandhi at 78. Therefore, RFK\
      \ was younger at his death than Gandhi. So the answer would be YES. But wait,\
      \ I need to make sure about RFK's age. Let me confirm again. RFK was born November\
      \ 20, 1925. Died June 6, 1968. So from November 20, 1925, to November 20, 1967,\
      \ he turned 42. Then from November 1967 to June 1968, he was 42 years old until\
      \ his next birthday. So when he died in June 1968, he was 42 years and about\
      \ 6 months old. So age 42. Therefore, 42 vs 78. So yes, RFK was younger at death.\n\
      </think>YES  \nRobert F. Kennedy was born on November 20, 1925, and died on\
      \ June 6, 1968, making him 42 years old at his death. Mahatma Gandhi was born\
      \ on October 2, 1869, and died on January 30, 1948, at age 78. Since 42 is younger\
      \ than 78, the answer is YES."

      \ death years, then calculate their ages at death and compare them.\n\nFirst,\
      \ I should recall when each of them died. Robert F. Kennedy, I think he was\
      \ assassinated in the 1960s. Maybe 1968? Because I remember he was a senator\
      \ and running for president when he was killed. So if he died in 1968, then\
      \ his birth year... I think he was part of the Kennedy family, so maybe born\
      \ around the 1920s. Let me check in my mind. His brother JFK was born in 1917,\

      \ that would make him 43 years old. Wait, 1968 minus 1925 is 43. Yeah, that\
      \ sounds right.\n\nNow, Mahatma Gandhi. He was assassinated in 1948, right?\
      \ Because India gained independence in 1947, and he was killed the next year.\
      \ So his death year is 1948. His birth year was 1869, I believe. So 1948 minus\
      \ 1869 would be... let's calculate that. 1948 minus 1869. 1869 + 79 = 1948.\
      \ So he was 78 years old when he died. \n\nSo RFK was 43, Gandhi was 78. Therefore,\
      \ yes, RFK was younger at the time of his death than Gandhi. Wait, but let me\
      \ double-check the dates to be sure. Sometimes I mix up exact years. \n\nRFK:\
      \ Born November 20, 1925. Died June 6, 1968. So from 1925 to 1968 is 43 years.\
      \ Correct. \n\nGandhi: Born October 2, 1869. Died January 30, 1948. So 1948\

      \ 1869 + 79 = 1948. Yes, that's right. So Gandhi was 78 years old when he died?\
      \ Wait, no. If you subtract 1869 from 1948, it's 79 years. But depending on\
      \ the exact birth and death dates, maybe he was 78 if his birthday hadn't occurred\
      \ yet in 1948. Let's see. Gandhi was born October 2, 1869. He died on January\
      \ 30, 1948. So in 1948, he hadn't reached his birthday yet (October 2) when\
      \ he died in January. So from October 2, 1869, to January 30, 1948, that's 78\
      \ years and about 3 months. So he was 78 years old at death. Wait, but sometimes\
      \ people count the years as completed. So 1948 - 1869 = 79, but since he died\
      \ before his birthday, it's 78. So he was 78. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. So depending\
      \ on how you calculate, but generally, when you subtract the birth year from\
      \ the death year, you get 79, but if the birthday hadn't occurred yet, you subtract\
      \ one. So in this case, he was 78. \n\nSo RFK was 43, Gandhi was 78. Therefore,\

      \ in India's independence movement. I think he was born in 1869, maybe October\

      \ he hadn't turned 79 yet that year. So he would be 78 years old at death.\n\
      \nNow, Robert F. Kennedy. He was a U.S. politician, brother of JFK. I recall\
      \ he was assassinated in 1968, right after winning the California Democratic\
      \ primary. His birth year, let me think. I believe he was born in 1925, November\

      \ 1948 is 3 months. So he was 78 years and 3 months old when he died. So approximately\
      \ 78 years old, but technically 78 years and 3 months. But maybe the exact age\
      \ in years is considered 78 at death, or 79? Hmm, maybe I should just take the\
      \ year difference. Since 1948 - 1869 is 79, but he hadn't reached his 79th birthday\
      \ yet. So his age at death was 78 years old. Wait, but sometimes people count\
      \ the years as completed. So if he was born in 1869, and died in 1948, 1948\

      \ - 1925 is 43, but since he died in June, he was 42 years old, because he would\
      \ have turned 43 in November 1968. So his age at death was 42. Correct. So RFK\

    1f8bc784-2f4e-4d32-b8e0-e845e201590b: '<think>Okay, let''s tackle this question
      step by step. So the question is whether Grace Kelly was younger when she died
      than Louis XIV of France was when he died. I need to figure out the ages at
      death for both and compare them.


      First, I should recall their dates. Let me start with Grace Kelly. I know she
      was an American actress who became Princess of Monaco. She died in a car accident,
      I think in the early 1980s. Let me check my memory: she was born in 1929, right?
      And she died in 1982. So her birth year is 1929, death year 1982. That would
      make her 1982 minus 1929, which is 53 years old at the time of her death. Wait,
      wait, no, 1982 minus 1929. Let''s calculate that. 1982 minus 1929 is 53, yes.
      So Grace Kelly was 53 when she died.


      Now, Louis XIV of France. He''s known as the Sun King. He had a very long reign.
      I remember he became king at a very young age and ruled for over 70 years. So
      his lifespan must have been quite long. Let''s see. When was he born and when
      did he die? If I recall correctly, he was born in 1638 and died in 1715. Let
      me confirm that. Yes, Louis XIV was born on September 5, 1638, and died on September
      1, 1715. So calculating his age at death: 1715 minus 1638. Let''s do the math.
      1715 minus 1638. 1715 minus 1600 is 115, and 1638 minus 1600 is 38. So 115 minus
      38 equals 77. But wait, wait, that''s not right because 1715 - 1638. Let me
      do it another way. Subtract 1638 from 1715: 1715 - 1638. 1638 + 77 = 1715, right?
      Because 1638 + 70 = 1708, then +7 more is 1715. So yes, 77 years old. So Louis
      XIV was 77 when he died.


      Comparing the two ages: Grace Kelly was 53, Louis XIV was 77. So 53 is younger
      than 77. Therefore, yes, Grace Kelly was younger at her time of death than Louis
      XIV was at his.

      </think>Grace Kelly was born in 1929 and died in 1982, making her 53 years old
      at her death. Louis XIV was born in 1638 and died in 1715, living to 77 years
      old. Since 53 is younger than 77, the answer is YES.

      \ Let me think... I believe she was born in 1929. Her death was in a car accident,\
      \ right? That happened in the early 1980s. Wait, I think it was 1982. So if\
      \ she was born in 1929 and died in 1982, her age would be 1982 minus 1929. Let\
      \ me do that subtraction: 1982 - 1929 equals 53 years old. So Grace Kelly was\
      \ 53 when she died.\n\nNow, Louis XIV. He's the famous French king known as\
      \ the Sun King. His reign was very long. I think he became king at a young age\
      \ and ruled for over 70 years. So he must have lived a long life. Let me recall\
      \ his birth and death years. Louis XIV was born in 1638, if I'm not mistaken.\
      \ His death was in 1715. To confirm, that's the year he died, and he was king\
      \ until his death. So his age at death would be 1715 minus 1638. Calculating\
      \ that: 1715 - 1638. Let's subtract: 1700 - 1638 is 62, and then add the remaining\
      \ 15 years from 1715, so 62 + 15 = 77. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually,\
      \ 1715 minus 1638. Let me do it step by step. 1638 + 77 would be 1638 + 70 =\
      \ 1708, then +7 = 1715. Yes, so 77 years old. So Louis XIV was 77 when he died.\n\
      \nComparing the two ages: Grace Kelly was 53, Louis XIV was 77. So yes, Grace\
      \ Kelly was younger at her time of death than Louis XIV. Therefore, the answer\
      \ should be YES.\n</think>Grace Kelly was born in 1929 and died in 1982, making\
      \ her 53 years old at her death. Louis XIV was born in 1638 and died in 1715,\
      \ living to 77 years old. Since 53 is younger than 77, the answer is YES. \n\
      \n**Answer:** YES"
    62f7feb6-ce85-45a4-8cce-de8394da247e: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the question is whether Grace Kelly was younger at her time of death than\
      \ Louis XIV of France when he died. Hmm. Alright, I need to figure out the ages\
      \ of both when they died and then compare them. Let me start by recalling what\
      \ I know about these two historical figures.\n\nFirst, Grace Kelly. She was\
      \ an American actress who became Princess of Monaco after marrying Prince Rainier\
      \ III. I remember that she died in a car accident. Let me think about her birth\
      \ and death years. I believe she was born in 1929. Her death was in the early\
      \ 80s maybe? Wait, no, actually I think she died in 1982. Let me confirm that.\
      \ Yes, Grace Kelly was born on November 12, 1929, and died on September 14,\
      \ 1982. So to calculate her age at death, subtract 1929 from 1982. That would\
      \ be 1982 - 1929 = 53 years old. Wait, but her birthday is in November and she\
      \ died in September, so she was 52 years old at the time of death, right? Because\
      \ she hadn't reached her 53rd birthday yet. Hmm, that's a detail to check. Let\
      \ me calculate: from November 12, 1929, to November 12, 1982, she would be 53.\
      \ But she died on September 14, 1982, which is two months before her birthday.\
      \ So 53 minus a couple of months, so technically 52 years old. But in terms\
      \ of age calculation, when we state someone's age at death, we usually count\
      \ the completed years. So she was 52 years old. Wait, but maybe the exact calculation\
      \ is 1982 minus 1929 equals 53, but because her birthday hadn't occurred yet\
      \ in 1982, she was 52. So her age at death is 52.\n\nNow, Louis XIV of France.\
      \ He's known as the Sun King. He had a very long reign. I think he became king\
      \ at a very young age and ruled for over 70 years. So he must have lived quite\
      \ a long life. Let me recall his birth and death years. Louis XIV was born in\
      \ 1638, if I'm not mistaken. He died in 1715. So his age at death would be 1715\
      \ minus 1638. Let's compute that: 1715 - 1638. 1715 minus 1600 is 115, minus\
      \ 38 is 77. So 77 years old. Wait, 1638 plus 77 is 1715. Yes, that's correct.\
      \ So Louis XIV was 76 or 77 when he died. Wait, let's calculate more accurately.\
      \ He was born on September 5, 1638, and died on September 1, 1715. So his birthday\
      \ was September 5th, and he died on September 1st. So in 1715, he hadn't reached\
      \ his birthday yet. Therefore, he was 76 years old at death. Wait, 1715 - 1638\
      \ = 77, but since he died four days before his 77th birthday, he was 76 years\
      \ old. Hmm, that's a critical point. So depending on the exact dates, he was\
      \ 76 when he died. But sometimes sources might round up. Let me verify.\n\n\
      According to historical records, Louis XIV was born on September 5, 1638, and\
      \ died on September 1, 1715. So the exact age would be 76 years, 11 months,\
      \ and about 27 days. So he was 76 years old, not yet 77. So his age at death\
      \ was 76.\n\nWait, but 1715 minus 1638 is 77 years. So if you subtract 1638\
      \ from 1715, you get 77, but because he died just a few days before his birthday,\
      \ he was actually 76. So the correct age is 76. So maybe some sources say 76,\
      \ others 77? Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. Let me check a reliable source.\
      \ For example, Encyclopedia Britannica states he was born on September 5, 1638,\
      \ and died on September 1, 1715, which would make him 76 years old, having not\
      \ yet reached his 77th birthday. So his age at death was 76.\n\nSo Grace Kelly\
      \ was 52, Louis XIV was 76. Therefore, Grace Kelly was younger at her death\
      \ than Louis XIV. So the answer would be YES.\n</think>Grace Kelly was born\
      \ in 1929 and died in 1982 at age 52 (born November 12, died September 14, so\
      \ 52 years old). Louis XIV was born in 1638 and died in 1715; subtracting the\
      \ birth year from the death year gives 77, but since he died on September 1\
      \ (4 days before his 77th birthday), he was 76 years old. Comparing their ages\
      \ at death: 52 (Grace Kelly) < 76 (Louis XIV). \n\nANSWER: YES"

      \ him 76 years old at his death. Since 52 is younger than 76, the answer is\
      \ YES.\n\nANSWER: YES"
    8083542c-abbc-44d8-bc02-cc84074c98cb: '<think>Okay, so the question is whether
      Grace Kelly was younger at her time of death than Louis XIV of France at his.
      Hmm, let me break this down.


      First, I need to find out when each of them died and their birth dates. Let''s
      start with Grace Kelly. I remember she was an American actress who became Princess
      of Monaco. I think she died in a car accident. Maybe in the 1980s? Let me check.
      She was born in 1929, right? And died in 1982. So if she was born in 1929 and
      died in 1982, that would make her 52 or 53 years old. Wait, subtract 1929 from
      1982. 1982 minus 1929 is 53 years old at death.


      Now, Louis XIV. He''s the French king known as the Sun King. He had a very long
      reign. I think he lived into his 70s. When was he born and when did he die?
      Let me recall. He was born in 1638, I believe, and died in 1715. So let''s calculate
      his age. 1715 minus 1638. Hmm, 1715 - 1638. Let''s do 1715 - 1600 = 115, then
      subtract 38 more: 115 - 38 = 77. So he was 77 years old when he died.


      Comparing the two: Grace Kelly was 53, Louis XIV was 77. So yes, Grace Kelly
      was younger at her death than Louis XIV was at his. Therefore, the answer is
      YES.

      </think>Grace Kelly was born on November 12, 1929, and died on September 14,
      1982, at age 53. Louis XIV of France was born on September 5, 1638, and died

      YES.

    01094869-1dae-4cfd-9f16-363e1288ae25: '<think>Okay, let''s try to figure this
      out. The question is whether John Lennon was younger when he died than Charles
      Darwin was when he died. I need to compare their ages at the times of their
      deaths.


      First, I should find out when each of them was born and when they died. Let''s
      start with John Lennon. I remember he was a member of The Beatles, and he was
      assassinated in 1980. His birth year, I think, is 1940. So if he died in 1980,
      subtracting 1940 from 1980 gives 40 years old. Wait, but I should check the
      exact dates. Lennon was born on October 9, 1940, and he died on December 8,
      1980. So from October 9, 1940, to October 9, 1980, he would be exactly 40. Then
      from October 9 to December 8, that''s two months and a few days. So he was 40
      years and about two months old when he died. So 40 years old.


      Now, Charles Darwin. He''s the famous naturalist who wrote "On the Origin of
      Species." I think he lived a long life. His dates might be early 19th century.
      Let me recall. He was born in 1809, same year as Abraham Lincoln. And he died
      in 1882. Let me confirm that. Yes, Darwin was born on February 12, 1809, and
      died on April 19, 1882. So calculating his age at death: 1882 minus 1809 is
      73 years. Then from February 12 to April 19 is about two months and a week.
      So he was 73 years and two months old when he died. So 73 years old.


      Comparing the two, John Lennon was 40, Darwin was 73. So yes, Lennon was younger
      at the time of his death than Darwin was when he died. Wait, but I need to make
      sure I didn''t mix up the dates. Let me double-check Lennon''s death age. Born
      1940, died 1980. 1980-1940=40. So 40 years old. Darwin 1809 to 1882 is 73. Correct.
      So the answer should be YES.

      </think>John Lennon was born on October 9, 1940, and died on December 8, 1980,
      making him 40 years old at his death. Charles Darwin was born on February 12,
      1809, and died on April 19, 1882, making him 73 years old at his death. Comparing
      their ages at death, John Lennon was indeed younger.


      YES'

      First, I should recall when each of them was born and when they died. Let''s
      start with John Lennon. I know he was part of The Beatles, and I remember he
      was shot in 1980, right? So he died in 1980. Now, when was he born? I think
      he was born in 1940. Let me confirm that. John Lennon was born on October 9,
      1940, and died on December 8, 1980. So to calculate his age, subtract 1940 from
      1980, which is 40 years. But wait, his birthday is in October and he died in
      December, so he was actually 40 years and about two months old when he died.
      So approximately 40 years old.


      Now, Charles Darwin. He''s the famous naturalist who wrote "On the Origin of
      Species." I think he lived a long life. When did he die? If I recall, he was
      born in 1809, the same year as Abraham Lincoln. And he died in 1882. Let me
      check that. Charles Darwin was born on February 12, 1809, and died on April
      19, 1882. So calculating his age: 1882 minus 1809 is 73. Then, since his birthday
      is in February and he died in April, he was 73 years and about two months old.
      So approximately 73 years old.


      Comparing the two, John Lennon was 40, and Charles Darwin was 73 at their respective
      times of death. So yes, John Lennon was younger. Therefore, the answer should
      be YES.

      The question is whether John Lennon was younger when he died than Charles Darwin
      was when he died. I need to compare their ages at the time of their deaths.


      First, I should recall when each of them was born and when they died. Starting
      with John Lennon. I know he was part of The Beatles, so he was active in the
      60s and 70s. He was assassinated in 1980, right? His birthday is October 9,
      1940. So if he died in 1980, subtracting 1940 from 1980 gives 40 years old.
      Wait, but he was killed on December 8, 1980. His birthday is in October, so
      by December he would have already turned 40 that year. So Lennon was 40 when
      he died.


      Now, Charles Darwin. He''s the famous naturalist who wrote "On the Origin of
      Species." I think he lived a longer life. Let me remember his dates. I believe
      he was born in 1809. When did he die? I recall he died in 1882. So subtract
      1809 from 1882. Let me calculate that: 1882 minus 1809. 1809 plus 73 is 1882,
      right? 1809 +70=1879, then +3=1882. So he would be 73 years old. Wait, but let
      me confirm. Darwin''s birth date is February 12, 1809, and he died on April
      19, 1882. So from February 1809 to February 1882 is 73 years, and then he died
      in April, so he had already turned 73. So Darwin was 73 at death.


      Comparing the two: Lennon was 40, Darwin was 73. So yes, Lennon was younger

      \ born in 1452. His death... I believe he died in 1516. Let me confirm that.\
      \ Yeah, Ferdinand was born on March 10, 1452, and died on January 23, 1516.\
      \ So, calculating his age at death: 1516 minus 1452. That's 64 years old. But\
      \ wait, he was born in March and died in January, so he hadn't reached his birthday\
      \ yet in 1516. So, 1516 - 1452 = 64, but subtract one year because he died before\
      \ March. So he was 63 years old when he died.\n\nNow, Otto von Bismarck. He's\
      \ the Iron Chancellor from Germany, right? He was a key figure in the unification\
      \ of Germany in the 19th century. His lifespan... I think he was born in 1815\
      \ and died in 1898. Let me check. Yes, Otto von Bismarck was born on April 1,\
      \ 1815, and died on July 30, 1898. Calculating his age: 1898 minus 1815. That's\
      \ 83 years. But he died in July, which is after his April birthday, so he was\
      \ 83 years old at death.\n\nSo comparing the two: Ferdinand was 63, Bismarck\
      \ was 83. Therefore, Ferdinand was younger at the time of his death than Bismarck.\
      \ So the answer should be YES.\n</think>Fernando de Arag\xF3n (Ferdinand II\

      \ death. Otto von Bismarck was born in 1815 and died in 1898, living to 83 years\
      \ old. Since 63 is younger than 83, the answer is YES.\n\n**ANSWER: YES**"
    3fa5cc67-deaa-4513-8730-7d42ed2fd98a: "<think>Alright, let's try to figure this\
      \ out. The question is asking whether Ferdinand of Aragon was younger when he\
      \ died compared to Otto von Bismarck when he died. Okay, first step, I need\
      \ the birth and death years for both historical figures to calculate their ages\
      \ at death.\n\nStarting with Ferdinand II of Aragon. From what I remember, he\
      \ was a key figure in the unification of Spain, married to Isabella I of Castile.\
      \ I think he was born in 1452. His death year... wasn't that around 1516? Let\
      \ me check that. Yes, Ferdinand was born on March 10, 1452, and died on January\
      \ 23, 1516. So to find his age at death: 1516 minus 1452. Hmm, 1516 - 1452 =\
      \ 64. But wait, he died in January 1516, and his birthday is in March, so he\
      \ would have been 63 years old at the time of death, right? Because he hadn't\
      \ turned 64 yet. So maybe 63 years old.\n\nNow, Otto von Bismarck. He's the\
      \ Iron Chancellor from Germany, right? Let me recall his dates. I think he was\
      \ born in 1815 and died in 1898. Let's confirm. Otto von Bismarck was born on\
      \ April 1, 1815, and died on July 30, 1898. Calculating his age: 1898 - 1815\
      \ = 83. But similar to Ferdinand, he died in July, and his birthday was in April.\
      \ Since July is after April, he had already turned 83 that year. So 83 years\
      \ old at death.\n\nSo Ferdinand was 63 (or maybe 64 depending on exact months)\
      \ and Bismarck was 83. Therefore, yes, Ferdinand was younger at the time of\
      \ his death than Bismarck. Wait, but I need to make sure about the exact ages.\
      \ Ferdinand's exact age would be from 1452 to 1516. Let's compute it precisely.\
      \ 1516 - 1452 = 64 years. But since he died in January 1516, before his March\
      \ birthday, he was 63 years and about 10 months old. So 63 years old. Bismarck\
      \ was 83 years old when he died. So 63 vs. 83. Therefore, YES, Ferdinand was\

      \ when they died. Let's start with Ferdinand of Aragon. If I remember correctly,\
      \ Ferdinand II of Aragon was part of the Catholic Monarchs, along with Isabella\

      \nI think Ferdinand was born in 1452. Let me confirm that. Yes, Ferdinand II\

      \ he died in 1516. Let me check that... Yes, he died on January 23, 1516. So\
      \ to calculate his age at death: 1516 minus 1452. That would be 64 years old.\
      \ But wait, his birthday is in March and he died in January, so he was actually\

      \ he was born in March 1452 and died in January 1516, then from March 1452 to\
      \ March 1515 would be 63 years, and then from March 1515 to January 1516 is\
      \ an additional 10 months. But since he died before March 1516, he was 63 years\
      \ old at death. Hmm, maybe some sources round it differently. But maybe I should\
      \ just check exact dates. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the calculation is 1516 minus\
      \ 1452 equals 64, but subtract one year if the death date is before the birthday\
      \ in the death year. Since his birthday is March 10 and he died January 23,\
      \ 1516, which is before March 10, so he was 63 years old. So yes, 63.\n\nNow\
      \ Otto von Bismarck. He was a German statesman in the 19th century. Known as\
      \ the Iron Chancellor. I think he was born in 1815. Let me confirm. Yes, Otto\

      \ 1898. So calculating his age: 1898 minus 1815. That's 83 years. His birthday\
      \ in 1898 would have been April 1, so since he died in July, which is after\
      \ April, he was 83 years old. So 83 years old at death.\n\nSo Ferdinand died\

      \ Otto von Bismarck was born on April 1, 1815, and died on July 30, 1898, making\

      \ II of Aragon was part of the Catholic Monarchs, along with Isabella of Castile.\
      \ They were the ones who sponsored Columbus's voyages. I think Ferdinand died\
      \ in the early 16th century. Let me check the dates. Ferdinand was born on March\
      \ 10, 1452. When did he die? I believe he died in 1516. Let me confirm: yes,\
      \ he died on January 23, 1516. So his lifespan was from 1452 to 1516. To find\
      \ his age at death, subtract 1452 from 1516. That would be 1516 - 1452 = 64\

      \ he was actually 63 years old, because he hadn't turned 64 yet. Hmm, need to\
      \ be careful with the exact dates. So, born March 10, 1452, died January 23,\
      \ 1516. Let's calculate the exact age. From March 10, 1452, to March 10, 1515,\
      \ he would be 63 years old. Then from March 10, 1515, to January 23, 1516, that's\
      \ 10 months and 13 days short of his 64th birthday. So he was 63 years old when\
      \ he died.\n\nNow, Otto von Bismarck. He's a more modern figure, the Iron Chancellor\

      \ Bismarck was born in 1815, I believe. His birth date is April 1, 1815. When\

      \ to April 1, 1898, he turned 83. Then from April 1 to July 30 is 3 months and\
      \ 29 days. So he was 83 years old at death. So Bismarck was 83 when he died,\
      \ and Ferdinand was 63. Therefore, Ferdinand was younger at his time of death\

      \ Let me check... Yes, Ferdinand II of Aragon was born on March 10, 1452. When\

      First, let's get the details for Ferdinand II of Aragon. From what I remember,\
      \ Ferdinand was part of the famous Ferdinand and Isabella duo, the Catholic\

      \ on January 23, 1516. So subtracting 1452 from 1516 gives 64 years, but since\
      \ his birthday was in March and he died in January, he hadn't turned 64 yet.\
      \ So he was 63 years old at death. Wait, maybe 64? Because from March 10, 1452,\
      \ to March 10, 1516, would be 64 years, but he died in January, so it's 63 years\
      \ and 10 months. So his age would be 63 years old. Hmm, sometimes these historical\
      \ dates can be a bit tricky. Maybe I should check exact calculation. 1516 minus\
      \ 1452 is 64, but since he died before his birthday in 1516, he was 63. So 63\
      \ years old.\n\nNow Otto von Bismarck. He was a German statesman, the Iron Chancellor.\
      \ His dates: born in 1815, died in 1898. Let's see. 1898 minus 1815 is 83 years.\

      \ death. So yes, 83.\n\nComparing the two: Ferdinand died at 63, Bismarck at\

      start with Vivaldi. I know he was a Baroque composer, so probably 17th or 18th
      century. I think he was Italian. Wait, Antonio Vivaldi... I remember he''s famous
      for "The Four Seasons." His dates... I think he was born in 1678 and died in
      1741. Let me check that in my mind. Yes, 1678-1741. So if that''s correct, he
      died at 63 years old. Wait, 1741 minus 1678 is 63. Yeah, that''s right.


      Now, Harry S. Truman. He was a U.S. President, right? The 33rd president, took
      over after FDR died. He was president during the end of World War II, decided

      in 1972. Let me calculate his age. 1972 minus 1884 is 88 years old. So Truman
      was 88 when he died.


      So comparing the two: Vivaldi died at 63, Truman at 88. So the question is,
      was Vivaldi younger at death than Truman? Yes, 63 is younger than 88. Therefore,
      the answer should be YES.


      Wait, but I need to make sure I have the correct dates. Let me double-check.
      Vivaldi: born March 4, 1678, died July 28, 1741. So 1741-1678 = 63. Correct.
      Truman: born May 8, 1884, died December 26, 1972. 1972 - 1884 is 88. So yes,

      \ and death years of both individuals. Let's start with Vivaldi. I remember\
      \ he was a Baroque composer, so he's from the 17th or 18th century. Vivaldi\
      \ composed The Four Seasons, right? I think he was born in 1678 and died in\
      \ 1741. Let me double-check that. Yeah, Vivaldi was born on March 4, 1678, and\
      \ died on July 28, 1741. So, if I subtract 1678 from 1741, that gives 63 years.\
      \ Wait, 1741 minus 1678... 1678 + 63 = 1741. So he was 63 when he died.\n\n\
      Now, Harry S. Truman. He was a U.S. President, the 33rd, right? He became president\
      \ after FDR died in 1945. I think he was born in the late 1800s. His presidency\

    8b8ed792-7d4f-42bd-8b80-262518555420: '<think>Okay, let''s try to figure out if
      Antonio Vivaldi was younger when he died compared to Harry S. Truman. Hmm, first,
      I need to know both of their birth and death years.


      Vivaldi, the composer, right? I think he was from the Baroque period. Maybe
      born in the late 1600s? Let me check my memory. Antonio Vivaldi was born in
      1678, I believe, and died in 1741. So if that''s right, he lived from 1678 to
      1741. Let me calculate his age at death: 1741 minus 1678. That would be 63 years
      old. Wait, 1741-1678 is 63? Let me verify that subtraction. 1678 + 63 is 1741,
      yes. So Vivaldi died at 63.


      Now, Harry S. Truman, the US president. He was president after FDR, right? So
      Truman was born in 1884, I think. His death year was 1972. Let''s see. If he
      was born in 1884 and died in 1972, subtracting 1884 from 1972. 1972 - 1884...
      1972 minus 1884. Let''s break it down: 1884 + 88 = 1972? Because 1884 + 80 is
      1964, then +8 is 1972. So 88 years old. So Truman was 88 when he died.


      Now comparing the two ages: Vivaldi was 63, Truman was 88. So yes, Vivaldi was
      younger at the time of his death than Truman. Therefore, the answer is YES.

      </think>Antonio Vivaldi was born in 1678 and died in 1741, making him 63 years
      old at death. Harry S. Truman was born in 1884 and died in 1972, living to 88
      years old. Since 63 is younger than 88, the answer is YES.


      ANSWER: YES'
    e0a898ca-4427-414b-9e22-094d486f5c45: '<think>Alright, let me try to figure this
      out. The question is whether Antonio Vivaldi was younger when he died than Harry
      S. Truman when he died. Okay, first I need to know the dates for both of them.


      Vivaldi was a composer, right? I remember he''s from the Baroque period. His
      most famous work is The Four Seasons. I think he lived in the 17th and 18th
      centuries. Let me check in my mind... Vivaldi was born in 1678 and died in 1741.
      So if he died in 1741, how old was he? Let''s subtract his birth year from his
      death year: 1741 minus 1678. That''s 63 years old. Wait, 1678 plus 63 would
      be 1741. Yeah, that''s right. So Vivaldi died at 63.


      Now, Harry S. Truman. He was a U.S. President, the one who took over after FDR
      died and made the decision to drop the atomic bombs. Let''s recall his lifespan.
      Truman was born in 1884, I believe. He died in 1972. Let''s do the math. 1972
      minus 1884. That would be 88 years old. Wait, 1884 plus 88 is 1972. Yep, that''s
      correct. So Truman was 88 when he died.


      So the question is, was Vivaldi younger at his death (63) than Truman at his
      death (88)? Comparing 63 and 88, 63 is definitely younger. Therefore, the answer
      should be YES. But wait, let me double-check the dates to make sure I didn''t
      mix up anything. Vivaldi: 1678-1741. Truman: 1884-1972. Yep, those dates are
      right. So the answer is YES, Vivaldi was younger when he died.

      1905, that would make him 77 years old. 1905 minus 1828 is 77. Okay.


      So Virginia Woolf was 59 when she died, Jules Verne was 77. So the question
      is, was Woolf younger at her death than Verne at his? Yes, 59 is younger than
      77. So the answer should be YES. Wait, but I need to make sure I have the dates
      correct. Let me double-check. Woolf: born 1882, died 1941. 1941-1882=59. Verne:
      born 1828, died 1905. 1905-1828=77. Yep, that''s correct. So yes, Virginia Woolf
      was younger.

    e6531578-8ae6-4c7f-b486-6e6edcce8b6c: '<think>Alright, let''s tackle this question.
      Okay, so the question is: Was Virginia Woolf younger at their time of death
      than Jules Verne at their time of death? Hmm. I need to compare the ages of
      these two individuals when they died.


      First, I should figure out the birth and death years for both Virginia Woolf
      and Jules Verne. Once I have those dates, I can calculate their ages at death
      and then compare them.


      Let me start with Virginia Woolf. I remember she was a famous English writer,
      part of the Bloomsbury Group. From what I recall, she was born in the late 19th
      century. Maybe around 1882? And she died during World War II. I think she committed
      suicide, possibly in 1941. Let me confirm that. Yes, Virginia Woolf was born
      on January 25, 1882, and she died on March 28, 1941. So to calculate her age
      at death: 1941 minus 1882. That would be 59 years old. Wait, but she died in
      March, so if her birthday was in January, she had already turned 59 that year.
      So yes, 59 years old at death.


      Now, Jules Verne. He was a French novelist known for science fiction like "Twenty
      Thousand Leagues Under the Sea." I think he was born in the 19th century as
      well, maybe 1828? And he lived into the early 20th century. Let me check. Jules
      Verne was born on February 8, 1828, and died on March 24, 1905. So his age at
      death would be 1905 minus 1828. That''s 77 years. Again, checking the months:
      he was born in February and died in March, so he had just turned 77 that year.
      So 77 years old.


      Comparing the two: Virginia Woolf was 59, and Jules Verne was 77 when they died.
      So the question is, was Woolf younger at her death than Verne was at his. Since
      59 is less than 77, the answer should be yes.

      </think>Virginia Woolf was born in 1882 and died in 1941, making her 59 at her
      death. Jules Verne was born in 1828 and died in 1905, making him 77 at his death.
      Since 59 is younger than 77, the answer is YES.

      \ 72 years old. So Lindbergh was 72 when he died.\n\nComparing the two: Descartes\

      \ dates. Let me double-check. Descartes: born March 31, 1596, died February\
      \ 11, 1650. So from 1596 to 1650 is 54 years, but since his birthday is in March\
      \ and he died in February, he hadn't turned 54 yet. Wait, that's a detail. Let's\
      \ calculate exact age. If he was born in March 1596 and died in February 1650,\
      \ he would be 53 years old, right? Because he died a month before his 54th birthday.\
      \ So 1650 - 1596 = 54, but subtract one year because he didn't reach March.\
      \ Wait, no. Let's see: from March 31, 1596, to March 31, 1650, would be exactly\
      \ 54 years. But he died on February 11, 1650, which is about a month and a half\
      \ before his 54th birthday. So his age at death would be 53 years and 10 months\
      \ or so. So technically, he was 53 years old. But usually, historical records\
      \ might list his age as 54, counting the years, not the exact days. Hmm, this\
      \ could affect the answer. Wait, but the question is about their age at the\
      \ time of death. If we go by the exact calculation, he was 53. But if we just\
      \ subtract the years, it's 54. Which is correct?\n\nSimilarly, Lindbergh: born\
      \ February 4, 1902, died August 26, 1974. So from 1902 to 1974 is 72 years.\
      \ But he was born in February and died in August, so he had already celebrated\
      \ his 72nd birthday in February 1974. So his exact age would be 72 years and\
      \ 6 months. So 72 years old.\n\nSo Descartes: 53 or 54? Let me check a reliable\
      \ source. According to standard biographies, Descartes was born on March 31,\
      \ 1596, and died on February 11, 1650. So the exact age would be 53 years, 10\
      \ months, and 11 days. But in terms of completed years, he was 53. However,\
      \ sometimes in historical contexts, the age is calculated by subtracting the\
      \ birth year from the death year, which would give 54. But strictly speaking,\
      \ since he died before his birthday in 1650, he was 53. However, this might\
      \ vary based on how the age is counted. For example, in some cultures, you are\
      \ considered a year older on New Year's, but in the West, it's based on the\
      \ actual birthday. So if we're precise, he was 53. But if the question uses\
      \ simple subtraction (1650-1596=54), then 54. This is a crucial point because\
      \ if Descartes was 53 and Lindbergh 72, the answer is still YES. But if Descartes\
      \ is considered 54, it's still YES. So regardless, the answer remains YES because\

      \ aviator, right? Famous for the first solo transatlantic flight. He was in\
      \ the 20th century. Let me get his dates. Lindbergh was born in 1901, I believe,\
      \ and died in 1974. Wait, so his age at death would be 1974 - 1901. That's 73\
      \ years. So Lindbergh was 73 when he died.\n\nComparing the two: Descartes died\
      \ at 54, Lindbergh at 73. So the question is, was Descartes younger when he\
      \ died than Lindbergh was? Yes, because 54 is less than 73. Therefore, the answer\
      \ should be YES.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the dates to be sure. Descartes\
      \ born March 31, 1596, died February 11, 1650. So if he died before his birthday\
      \ in 1650, he would have been 53 or 54? Let's calculate more precisely. 1650\
      \ minus 1596 is 54, but since his birthday is in March and he died in February,\
      \ he hadn't turned 54 yet. So his age at death was 53 years and about 10 and\
      \ a half months. So actually, he was 53 years old when he died. Wait, that's\
      \ a mistake in my initial calculation. Because if he was born in March 1596\
      \ and died in February 1650, then he would have been 54 minus 1 month, so 53\
      \ years and 11 months. So technically, 53 years old. But usually, historical\
      \ records might just subtract the years, giving 54. Hmm, but perhaps the exact\
      \ dates matter here. Let me check a reliable source. Okay, according to standard\
      \ biographies, Descartes was born on March 31, 1596, and died on February 11,\
      \ 1650. So subtracting 1596 from 1650 gives 54, but since his birthday is March\
      \ 31, he died before his 54th birthday. Therefore, his exact age was 53 years,\
      \ 10 months, and 11 days. So he was 53 at the time of death. \n\nBut sometimes,\
      \ in historical contexts, the age is calculated as the difference in years,\
      \ without considering the exact months. So it's possible that some sources list\
      \ him as 54. This could affect the answer. Let's check Lindbergh's exact dates.\
      \ Charles Lindbergh was born on February 4, 1902, and died on August 26, 1974.\
      \ So 1974 minus 1902 is 72 years. But he was born in February and died in August,\
      \ so he had already turned 72 in February 1974, so 72 years and 6 months, so\

      \ of his death than Elvis Presley. The answer should be YES. But wait, let me\
      \ make sure I have the dates right. Sometimes people mix up exact dates. Kurt\
      \ Cobain: born February 20, 1967, died April 5, 1994. So from February 1967\
      \ to April 1994. That's 27 years and about 2 months. Elvis was born January\
      \ 8, 1935, died August 16, 1977. So from January 1935 to August 1977. That's\
      \ 42 years and 7 months. So even if we account for the exact months, Elvis was\
      \ definitely older. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step\
      \ Explanation:**  \n1. **Kurt Cobain**: Born February 20, 1967; died April 5,\
      \ 1994.  \n   - Age at death: 1994 - 1967 = **27 years** (part of the \"27 Club\"\

      \ So, the question is asking whether Kurt Cobain was younger at the time of\
      \ his death than Elvis Presley was when he died. Hmm, okay, I need to figure\
      \ out their ages when they passed away and compare them.\n\nFirst, let me recall\
      \ when each of them died. I know Kurt Cobain was the lead singer of Nirvana,\
      \ and he died in the 90s. I think it was 1994. Elvis Presley, the King of Rock\
      \ and Roll, died in the late 70s. I remember it was 1977. Now, their birth years.\
      \ Let me think. Kurt Cobain was born in 1967, I believe. Because if he died\
      \ in 1994 and was 27, that would make sense. Oh wait, there's the whole \"27\
      \ Club\" thing with musicians dying at 27, like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin,\
      \ and Kurt Cobain. So yeah, he was 27 when he died in 1994. \n\nNow, Elvis Presley.\
      \ He was born in 1935. Let me confirm that. Elvis was born on January 8, 1935,\
      \ and he died on August 16, 1977. So, to calculate his age at death, subtract\
      \ 1935 from 1977. 1977 minus 1935 is 42. So Elvis was 42 years old when he died.\
      \ \n\nWait, so Kurt Cobain was 27 and Elvis was 42. So comparing the two, 27\
      \ is younger than 42. Therefore, the answer should be yes, Kurt Cobain was younger\
      \ at his time of death than Elvis Presley. \n\nBut let me double-check the birth\
      \ and death years just to make sure I didn't mix anything up. Kurt Cobain: born\
      \ 1967, died 1994. 1994 minus 1967 is 27. Elvis: 1935 to 1977. 1977 minus 1935\

      \ compare the two.\n\nStarting with Roald Dahl. I think he was a British author,\
      \ famous for children's books like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. If I recall\
      \ correctly, he died in the 1990s. Maybe around 1990? Let me check... Wait,\

      \ years old at death, not 81. Wait, that's a mistake. Let me do the exact calculation.\
      \ From October 18, 1919, to October 18, 2000, would be 81 years. But he died\
      \ on September 28, 2000, which is 20 days before his 81st birthday. So he was\

      \ Dahl was younger at death than Trudeau. \n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in\
      \ the exact years. Let me confirm from reliable sources. \n\nChecking Roald\
      \ Dahl's dates: Yes, he was born on 13 September 1916 and died on 23 November\
      \ 1990. That makes him 74 years old (since from 1916 to 1990 is 74 years, and\

      \ Since 74 < 80, Dahl was younger at his death than Trudeau."
    64b9bc21-38bb-4799-a6f9-3b43b19d928f: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the question is whether Roald Dahl was younger at the time of his death\
      \ than Pierre Trudeau was when he died. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure out\
      \ the birth and death years of both individuals and then calculate their ages\
      \ at death to compare.\n\nStarting with Roald Dahl. I remember he was a famous\
      \ British author, known for books like \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\"\
      \ and \"Matilda.\" I think he died in the 1990s. Let me recall... I believe\
      \ he passed away in 1990. As for his birth year, I think he was born in 1916.\
      \ So if he died in 1990, subtracting 1916 from 1990 gives 74 years old. Wait,\
      \ but I should double-check that. Maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Let me confirm:\
      \ Roald Dahl was born on September 13, 1916, and died on November 23, 1990.\
      \ So that would make him 74 years old at the time of death. Okay, that seems\
      \ right.\n\nNow, Pierre Trudeau. He was a Canadian Prime Minister, right? I\
      \ know his son Justin Trudeau is the current PM. Pierre Trudeau was in office\
      \ during the late 60s through the 80s, I think. His death year... I recall he\
      \ died in 2000. Wait, no, maybe earlier. Let me think. He was born in 1919 or\
      \ 1920? Let me check. Pierre Elliott Trudeau was born on October 18, 1919, and\
      \ died on September 28, 2000. So if he died in 2000, subtracting 1919 from 2000\
      \ gives 81 years old. Wait, but he died in September 2000, and his birthday\
      \ was in October, so he was 80 years old at death because he hadn't turned 81\
      \ yet. Let me calculate: from October 18, 1919, to September 28, 2000, that's\
      \ 80 years, 11 months, and 10 days. So he was 80 years old when he died.\n\n\
      Wait, but if Dahl was 74 and Trudeau was 80, then Dahl was indeed younger at\
      \ the time of his death. So the answer would be YES. But wait, let me make sure\
      \ I didn't mix up their birth and death dates. Let me verify again.\n\nRoald\
      \ Dahl: 1916 to 1990. 1990 minus 1916 is 74. Correct. Pierre Trudeau: 1919 to\
      \ 2000. 2000 minus 1919 is 81, but since he died in September 2000 before his\
      \ October birthday, he was 80. So 80. Therefore, 74 (Dahl) vs. 80 (Trudeau).\
      \ So yes, Dahl was younger. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine\
      \ if Roald Dahl was younger at his death than Pierre Trudeau, we calculate their\
      \ ages:\n\n- **Roald Dahl**: Born September 13, 1916; died November 23, 1990.\
      \  \n  Age at death: \\(1990 - 1916 = 74\\) years.\n\n- **Pierre Trudeau**:\
      \ Born October 18, 1919; died September 28, 2000.  \n  Since he died before\
      \ his 81st birthday, his age at death was \\(2000 - 1919 - 1 = 80\\) years (specifically\
      \ 80 years, 11 months, and 10 days).\n\n**Conclusion**: Roald Dahl (74) was\
      \ younger at death than Pierre Trudeau (80). \n\nANSWER: YES"
    67d5a6f2-13b5-4ce4-a8d7-9caa049a98fa: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Roald Dahl was younger when he died than Pierre Trudeau was when he\

      \nFirst, I need to recall the birth and death years for both people. Let's start\
      \ with Roald Dahl. I know he was a famous British author, wrote books like Charlie\
      \ and the Chocolate Factory. I think he died in the 1990s. Maybe around 1990?\
      \ As for his birth year, maybe early 1900s? Wait, I remember something about\
      \ him serving in World War II, so he must have been born in the 1910s. Wait,\
      \ no, if he served in WWII, which was in the 1940s, he'd probably be in his\
      \ 20s or 30s then. Let me check my memory. Oh right, Roald Dahl was born in\
      \ 1916. So if he served in the Royal Air Force during the war, that makes sense\
      \ because he'd be in his mid-20s then. And he died in 1990. So calculating his\
      \ age: 1990 minus 1916 is 74 years old.\n\nNow, Pierre Trudeau. He was a Canadian\
      \ Prime Minister. I know his son Justin Trudeau is the current PM. Pierre Trudeau\
      \ died a while back. I think he was in office during the 70s and 80s. His death\
      \ year... I believe he died in 2000? Wait, no, that seems too recent. Let me\
      \ think. Pierre Trudeau was born in 1919 or 1920. Wait, I think he was born\
      \ in 1919. And died in 2000. So if he was born in 1919 and died in 2000, that\
      \ would make him 80 or 81 years old. Wait, 2000 minus 1919 is 81 years. So if\
      \ Dahl died at 74 and Trudeau at 81, then yes, Dahl was younger when he died.\n\
      \nWait, but let me confirm the exact birth and death dates to be sure. Roald\
      \ Dahl: born September 13, 1916, died November 23, 1990. That's 74 years old.\
      \ Pierre Trudeau: born October 18, 1919, died September 28, 2000. So 2000 minus\
      \ 1919 is 81 years, but since he died in September and was born in October,\
      \ he hadn't turned 81 yet. So from October 18, 1919, to September 28, 2000,\
      \ it's 80 years and 11 months, so 80 years old. Wait, that's confusing. Let's\
      \ calculate exact age. If someone is born on October 18, 1919, and dies on September\
      \ 28, 2000, they would be 80 years old, because they haven't reached their 81st\
      \ birthday yet. So 80 years and 11 months. So Trudeau was 80 at death, and Dahl\
      \ was 74. Therefore, yes, Dahl was younger.\n</think>YES  \nRoald Dahl was born\
      \ on September 13, 1916, and died on November 23, 1990, making him 74 years\
      \ old at his death. Pierre Trudeau was born on October 18, 1919, and died on\

      \ Prime Minister, right? Father of Justin Trudeau. Pierre Trudeau, I think he\
      \ died in 2000. Wait, no, maybe earlier. Let me recall. He served as PM in the\

      \ 1919, so up to September 28, 2000, he would have been 80 years old, right?\

      \ each year on his birthday he adds a year. By September 28, 2000, he hadn't\

      \ So, the question is whether Mozart was younger when he died than Peter the\

      \ death years of both historical figures and then calculate their ages at the\
      \ time of death.\n\nStarting with Mozart. I remember that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\
      \ was a famous composer from the classical era. I think he died relatively young.\
      \ Let me recall... I believe he was born in 1756. His death year, if I'm not\
      \ mistaken, was 1791. So, if he was born in 1756 and died in 1791, that would\
      \ make him 35 years old when he died. Wait, 1791 minus 1756 is 35. Yeah, that's\
      \ right. So Mozart died at 35.\n\nNow, Peter the Great. He was a Russian tsar,\
      \ right? I need his birth and death years. Peter the Great, or Peter I, I think\
      \ he ruled in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Let me think. I recall\
      \ he founded Saint Petersburg, which was in 1703. So he must have been born\
      \ earlier. His birth year... maybe 1672? And he died in 1725. Let me check that.\
      \ If he was born in 1672 and died in 1725, that would make him 52 or 53 years\
      \ old. Wait, 1725 minus 1672 is 53. So Peter the Great died at age 52 or 53?\
      \ Hmm, maybe I should confirm these dates. \n\nWait, I think Peter the Great\
      \ was born on June 9, 1672, and died on February 8, 1725. So calculating his\
      \ age: from 1672 to 1725 is 53 years, but since his death was in February, he\
      \ would have been 52 years and about 8 months old. So his age at death was 52\
      \ years old. Wait, but depending on the exact dates, sometimes the calculation\
      \ can be a year off. Let me do the exact math. From June 9, 1672, to June 9,\
      \ 1725, that's exactly 53 years. But he died on February 8, 1725, which is 4\
      \ months and 1 day before his 53rd birthday. So he was 52 years old at the time\
      \ of death. So Peter the Great died at 52 years old.\n\nWait, but Mozart died\
      \ at 35. So the question is: was Mozart (35) younger at death than Peter the\
      \ Great (52)? Yes, 35 is younger than 52. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\
      \ But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the dates. Maybe I got Peter's\
      \ birth or death year wrong. Let me double-check. \n\nPeter the Great's reign\
      \ was from 1682 until his death in 1725. His birth year is indeed 1672. So 1725\
      \ minus 1672 is 53, but since he died before his birthday in June, he was 52.\
      \ So 52 years old. Mozart was 35. So 35 is younger than 52. Therefore, YES,\
      \ Mozart was younger at his time of death than Peter the Great was at his.\n\

    4605a8d1-fa49-4656-aa73-79bcd12e0db8: '<think>Okay, let me try to figure this
      out. The question is asking if Mozart was younger when he died than Peter the
      Great was when he died. I need to compare their ages at the time of their deaths.


      First, I should find out when each of them was born and when they died. Then
      calculate their ages at death. Let''s start with Mozart. I remember that Mozart
      was a famous composer from the Classical era. I think he died relatively young.
      If I recall correctly, he was born in 1756 and died in 1791. So if he was born
      in 1756 and died in 1791, subtracting 1756 from 1791 gives 35. So Mozart was
      35 years old when he died.


      Now, Peter the Great. He was a Russian tsar, right? I think he ruled in the
      late 17th and early 18th centuries. His lifespan... Maybe he was born in 1672?
      Let me check that. If he was born in 1672 and died in 1725, that would make
      him 1725 - 1672 = 53 years old at death. Wait, I''m not 100% sure about the
      exact years. Let me confirm. Peter the Great was indeed born on June 9, 1672,
      and died on February 8, 1725. So calculating his age: from 1672 to 1725 is 53
      years, minus a few months since he died in February, but since both birth and
      death years are counted, it''s 53 years. So Peter the Great was 52 or 53 when
      he died. Either way, older than 35.


      Therefore, Mozart was indeed younger at his time of death than Peter the Great
      was. The answer should be YES.

      </think>Mozart was born in 1756 and died in 1791, making him 35 at his death.
      Peter the Great was born in 1672 and died in 1725, living to age 52. Since 35
      is younger than 52, the answer is YES.

      \ exact dates: Peter the Great was born on June 9, 1672, and died on February\
      \ 8, 1725. So from June 9, 1672, to February 8, 1725. Let's calculate the age.\
      \ Subtract 1672 from 1725: that's 53 years. But from June to February is about\
      \ 8 months short of a full year. So he would be 52 years and 8 months old when\
      \ he died. Wait, but actually, when you subtract the years, 1725 - 1672 = 53,\

      \ whether Mozart was younger when he died than Peter the Great was when he died.\
      \ Hmm, I need to figure out both of their ages at death and compare them. \n\
      \nFirst, I should recall their birth and death years. Let me start with Mozart.\
      \ I think he was a composer from the classical period. If I remember right,\
      \ he was born in 1756 and died in 1791. So to get his age at death, I subtract\
      \ 1756 from 1791. Let me do that: 1791 minus 1756. That would be 35 years old.\
      \ Wait, yeah, Mozart died at 35.\n\nNow, Peter the Great. He was a Russian tsar,\
      \ right? His reign was in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Let me think.\
      \ I believe he was born in 1672 and died in 1725. So his age at death would\
      \ be 1725 minus 1672. Let me calculate that: 1725 minus 1672. That's 53 years\
      \ old. \n\nSo Mozart was 35 when he died, Peter the Great was 53. Therefore,\
      \ yes, Mozart was younger at the time of his death than Peter the Great. Wait,\
      \ but I should double-check the dates to make sure I didn't mix them up. \n\n\
      Mozart: 1756-1791. 1791 minus 1756 is indeed 35. Peter the Great: 1672-1725.\
      \ 1725 minus 1672 is 53. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be YES.\n\
      </think>**Step 1: Determine Mozart's birth and death years.**  \nWolfgang Amadeus\

    1a99e4fe-954c-4186-b533-e21ed6a27509: '<think>Alright, let''s tackle this question.
      So, the question is whether Edgar Allan Poe was younger at the time of his death
      than Kenny Rogers was when he died. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure out the
      birth and death years of both individuals and then calculate their ages at death
      to compare.


      Starting with Edgar Allan Poe. I remember he was a famous writer and poet from
      the 19th century. I think he was born in 1809. Let me confirm that. Yes, Edgar
      Allan Poe was born on January 19, 1809. When did he die? I recall that he died
      under mysterious circumstances. I think it was in 1849. So, October 7, 1849.
      So, to calculate his age, subtract 1809 from 1849. That would be 40 years old.
      Wait, but since his birthday is in January and he died in October, he would
      have been 40 years old. So Poe was 40 when he died.


      Now, Kenny Rogers. He''s a country singer, more modern. I know he lived a long
      life. Let me think. He passed away relatively recently. I believe he died in
      2020. Let me check. Yes, Kenny Rogers died on March 20, 2020. His birth year?
      He was born in 1938, I think. August 21, 1938. So, from 1938 to 2020. Let''s
      calculate his age. 2020 minus 1938 is 82 years. But since his birthday is in
      August and he died in March, he hadn''t turned 82 yet in 2020. Wait, no. Wait,
      2020 minus 1938 is 82, but he died in March, which is before his August birthday.
      So he was 81 years old at the time of death. Wait, let me do the math properly.
      If he was born in August 1938, then in March 2020, he would have been 81 years
      and about 7 months old. So, 81 years old. But sometimes people count the year
      if the death is after the birthday. Wait, no, because March comes before August.
      So he hadn''t had his 82nd birthday yet. So his age at death was 81.


      Wait, but let me double-check. 1938 + 82 = 2020. So if he was born in August
      1938, then August 2020 would have been his 82nd birthday. But he died in March
      2020, so he was 81 years old. Therefore, Kenny Rogers was 81 when he died.


      So Poe died at 40, Rogers at 81. Therefore, Poe was indeed younger at the time
      of his death than Kenny Rogers. So the answer should be YES.

      </think>Edgar Allan Poe was born in 1809 and died in 1849 at age 40. Kenny Rogers
      was born in 1938 and died in 2020 at age 81. Since 40 is younger than 81, the
      answer is YES.


      **Answer:** YES'
    1e95ec56-0384-49af-bb15-56a6f4ad750c: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure out if\
      \ Edgar Allan Poe was younger when he died compared to Kenny Rogers. Hmm, first\

      \ a famous writer and poet. I remember he lived in the 1800s. Maybe he was born\
      \ around 1809? Let me check that. Yeah, I think he was born in 1809. When did\
      \ he die? I think he died relatively young. I recall something about him passing\
      \ away in 1849. So that would make him 40 years old when he died because 1849\
      \ minus 1809 is 40.\n\nNow, Kenny Rogers was a country singer. He's more modern.\
      \ I believe he died recently, maybe in 2020? I need to confirm his birth year.\

      \ 1938 from 2020. Let's see, 2020 minus 1938 is 82. So he was 82 when he died.\n\
      \nWait, Poe was 40 and Rogers was 82. So yes, Poe was definitely younger at\
      \ the time of his death than Rogers. But let me double-check the dates to be\
      \ sure. Poe: born January 19, 1809, died October 7, 1849. So 40 years old. Kenny\
      \ Rogers was born August 21, 1938, died March 20, 2020. That's 2020 minus 1938\

      \ 81, Poe was younger at his time of death than Rogers.\n\n**Answer: YES**"

      \ Pierre-Auguste Renoir. He was a French painter, part of the Impressionist\

      \ born 1841, died 1919. So 1919 minus 1841 is 78 years old.\n\nWait, but I'm\
      \ not 100% sure about the exact years. Maybe I should double-check. For Terry\
      \ Pratchett, a quick check: yes, he was born April 28, 1948, and died March\
      \ 12, 2015. That would be 66 years old, because from April 1948 to March 2015\
      \ is just shy of 67. Wait, let me calculate the exact age. If he died in March\
      \ 2015 and was born in April 1948, he would have been 66 years and 10 or 11\
      \ months old, so 66 years old. But sometimes people state the age as the completed\
      \ years, so depending on the exact dates. However, it's common to subtract the\
      \ birth year from the death year and adjust if the birthday hadn't occurred\
      \ yet. Since he died in March and his birthday was in April, he hadn't turned\
      \ 67 yet, so 66 years old at death. But maybe the original question is using\
      \ the simple subtraction, which would be 67. Hmm, this might affect the answer.\n\
      \nFor Renoir, let me confirm. Pierre-Auguste Renoir was born February 25, 1841,\
      \ and died December 3, 1919. So calculating his age: 1919 minus 1841 is 78.\
      \ From February to December, he had his birthday in February 1919, so he was\
      \ 78 years old when he died. So that's accurate.\n\nSo if Terry Pratchett was\
      \ 66 or 67, and Renoir was 78, then Terry was younger at death. Therefore, the\
      \ answer should be YES, Terry Pratchett was younger than Renoir at the time\

      \ was younger at his time of death. So the answer should be YES. But let me\
      \ double-check the dates to make sure I didn't mix anything up.\n\nTerry Pratchett:\
      \ born 28 April 1948, died 12 March 2015. So 2015 - 1948 is 67 years, but since\
      \ his birthday is in April and he died in March, he was actually 66 years old\

      \ that's 11 months before his next birthday, so he would be 66 years and 11\
      \ months old. So his exact age would be 66 years old. Hmm, but sometimes when\
      \ people state age at death, they might count the completed years. Let me check.\
      \ For example, if someone is born on 1st January 2000 and dies on 1st December\
      \ 2001, they are 1 year old, even though they were 1 year and 11 months old.\
      \ Wait, no. That's incorrect. Age is calculated as the number of completed years.\
      \ So if you were born on April 28, 1948, then on April 28, 2015, you turn 67.\
      \ If you die on March 12, 2015, you haven't reached 67 yet, so your age is 66.\
      \ So Terry Pratchett was 66 years old at death. But sometimes sources might\
      \ round up? Let me verify. Quick check: Terry Pratchett's death date. According\

      \ in January 1965, and his birthday is in November. So from November 30, 1874,\
      \ to November 30, 1964, he would have been 90. Then from November 1964 to January\
      \ 1965 is two months, so he was 90 years and 2 months old when he died. So approximately\
      \ 90 years old, but technically 90 years, 1 month, and 24 days. But for simplicity,\
      \ people often say he was 90 when he died.\n\nNow, James Brown. He's the \"\
      Godfather of Soul.\" His death was more recent. I think he died in 2006. His\
      \ birth year... maybe 1933? Let me check. James Brown was born on May 3, 1933,\
      \ and died on December 25, 2006. So calculating his age: 2006 - 1933 = 73 years.\
      \ But again, checking the exact dates. From May 3, 1933, to May 3, 2006, he\
      \ turned 73. Then from May to December 2006 is 7 months. So he was 73 years\
      \ and about 7 months old when he died. So 73 years old.\n\nComparing the two:\
      \ Churchill was 90, James Brown was 73. Therefore, yes, James Brown was younger\
      \ at the time of his death than Churchill. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake\
      \ in the birth years? Let me double-check. \n\nChurchill: 1874-1965. 1965 minus\
      \ 1874 is indeed 91, but since his birthday is in November and he died in January,\
      \ he was 90 years old. James Brown: 1933-2006. 2006-1933 =73. That's correct.\
      \ So 73 vs 90. So the answer is YES.\n</think>James Brown was born on May 3,\

    d7bc4357-f26d-4543-988a-3e691c5d5ef6: '<think>Alright, let''s tackle this question.
      So, the question is whether James Brown was younger at the time of his death
      than Winston Churchill was when he died. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure
      out the birth and death years of both individuals and then calculate their ages
      at death to compare.


      Starting with Winston Churchill. I remember he was a British Prime Minister
      during World War II. Let me recall his dates. I think he was born in 1874. His
      death year... I believe he died in 1965. Let me confirm that. Yes, Winston Churchill
      was born on November 30, 1874, and died on January 24, 1965. So, to calculate
      his age at death: 1965 minus 1874. That would be 91 years old. Wait, but he
      died in January 1965, so he was 90 years old when he died because his birthday
      is in November. Let me check that again. If he was born in November 1874, then
      in November 1964 he would have turned 90. Since he died in January 1965, he
      was 90 years and 2 months old. So, his age at death was 90 years.


      Now, James Brown. He''s the "Godfather of Soul," right? I need his birth and
      death years. I think he was born in 1933. His death... I recall he died around
      Christmas time, maybe 2006? Let me verify. James Brown was born on May 3, 1933,
      and died on December 25, 2006. So, calculating his age: 2006 minus 1933. That''s
      73 years. But since his birthday is in May, and he died in December, he was
      73 years old at the time of death. So, 73 years.


      Comparing the two: Churchill was 90, James Brown was 73. So, James Brown was
      indeed younger at the time of his death than Churchill was. Therefore, the answer
      should be YES.

      </think>James Brown was born on May 3, 1933, and died on December 25, 2006,
      making him 73 years old at death. Winston Churchill was born on November 30,
      1874, and died on January 24, 1965, making him 90 years old at death. Since
      73 is younger than 90, the answer is YES.


      **ANSWER: YES**'

      \ was born on November 30, 1874, and he died on January 24, 1965. To calculate\
      \ his age at death, subtract his birth year from his death year: 1965 - 1874.\
      \ That would be 91 years old. But wait, since his birthday is in November and\
      \ he died in January, he had already turned 90 in 1964, so by January 1965,\
      \ he was 90 years and about two months old. Wait, no, let's check the exact\
      \ calculation. From November 30, 1874, to November 30, 1964, that's exactly\
      \ 90 years. Then from November 30, 1964, to January 24, 1965, is another 1 month\
      \ and 24 days. So total age would be 90 years, 1 month, and 24 days. So he was\
      \ 90 years old at death.\n\nNow James Brown. He was the \"Godfather of Soul.\"\
      \ I think he died in 2006. Let me check. James Brown was born on May 3, 1933,\
      \ and died on December 25, 2006. So to calculate his age: 2006 minus 1933 is\
      \ 73. But again, checking the exact dates. From May 3, 1933, to May 3, 2006,\

      \ at his death. Since 73 is less than 90, James Brown was younger when he died\
      \ than Churchill was when he died.\n\n**ANSWER: YES**"
    efee6df2-d5cc-4c3d-be41-c7c145fb82b5: '<think>Okay, let''s see. The question is
      asking whether James Brown was younger when he died compared to Winston Churchill''s
      age at his death. So I need to find out the death ages of both and compare them.


      First, I should recall when each of them was born and when they died. Let me
      start with Winston Churchill. From what I remember, Churchill was a British
      Prime Minister during World War II. He was born in 1874, I think. And he died
      in 1965. Let me check that. Yes, Winston Churchill was born on November 30,
      1874, and died on January 24, 1965. So his age at death would be 1965 minus
      1874. Let''s do the math: 1965 - 1874 = 91 years. Wait, but he was born in November
      and died in January. So he was 90 years old for most of 1964, and turned 91
      in November 1964. Since he died in January 1965, he was 90 years and about 1
      month old. But when calculating age at death, we typically go by the birth year
      minus death year, adjusting if the birthday hadn''t occurred yet. Since he died
      in January, before his November birthday, he would have been 90 years old. Hmm,
      maybe I need to confirm. Let me calculate it properly. From November 30, 1874,
      to November 30, 1964, he would be exactly 90 years old. Then he died on January
      24, 1965, so that''s 1 month and 24 days after his 90th birthday. So his exact
      age would be 90 years, 1 month, and 24 days. But usually, when people state
      age at death, they count the completed years. So he was 90 years old at death.
      Wait, but some sources might list him as 90, others as 90 and a bit. Let me
      check a reliable source. Quick check: Winston Churchill died at age 90. Yeah,
      I think that''s the standard answer.


      Now, James Brown, the Godfather of Soul. When was he born? I think he was born
      in 1933. His death year... I remember he died on Christmas Day in 2006. So born
      in 1933, died in 2006. Let''s calculate his age. 2006 minus 1933 is 73. But
      wait, his birthday? James Brown was born on May 3, 1933. He died on December
      25, 2006. So from May 3, 1933, to May 3, 2006, he was 73 years old. Then he
      died in December, which is after his birthday, so he was 73 years old at death.
      So his age at death was 73.


      So comparing the two: Churchill was 90, James Brown was 73. Therefore, James
      Brown was indeed younger when he died than Churchill. So the answer is YES.

      </think>James Brown was born on May 3, 1933, and died on December 25, 2006,
      making him 73 years old at his death. Winston Churchill was born on November
      30, 1874, and died on January 24, 1965, at age 90. Since 73 is younger than
      90, the answer is YES.

      \ death 72 years old.\n\nNow, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. He was the President of\
      \ India, right? The \"Missile Man of India.\" I'm a bit less sure about his\
      \ dates. I think he was born in 1931. Let me confirm. Yes, his full name is\
      \ Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, and he was born on October 15, 1931.\
      \ When did he die? I remember it was more recent. Maybe around 2015? I think\
      \ he passed away on July 27, 2015. So if he was born in 1931 and died in 2015,\
      \ that would make him 83 or 84 years old. Let's calculate: 2015 minus 1931 is\
      \ 84 years. Wait, but his birthday is in October, and he died in July, so he\
      \ hadn't reached his 84th birthday yet. So 2015 - 1931 = 84, but since he died\
      \ in July, he was 83 years old at the time of death. Wait, no. If he was born\
      \ in October 1931, then in July 2015, he would have been 83 years and 9 months\
      \ old. So his age would be 83 years. But sometimes, in terms of completed years,\
      \ it's 83. But maybe the exact calculation is 2015 minus 1931 equals 84, but\
      \ since his birthday hadn't occurred yet in 2015, he was 83. So that's 83 years\
      \ old.\n\nSo Asimov died at 72, and Kalam at 83. Therefore, Asimov was younger\

      Asimov: born 1920, died 1992. 1992 - 1920 = 72. Correct. Kalam: born 1931, died\
      \ 2015. 2015 - 1931 = 84, but since he died in July before his October birthday,\
      \ he was 83. Wait, no, wait. If you subtract 1931 from 2015, you get 84 years.\
      \ But if the death date is before the birthday in the year of death, you subtract\
      \ one. So for example, if someone is born on October 15, 1931, and dies on July\
      \ 27, 2015, they haven't had their 84th birthday yet. So their age would be\
      \ 83 years. So 2015 - 1931 = 84, but subtract 1 because the birthday hadn't\
      \ occurred, so 83. Therefore, Kalam was 83 when he died. Asimov was 72. So 72\
      \ is younger than 83. Therefore, YES, Asimov was younger at the time of his\

      \ died at 72, Kalam at 84. That would mean Asimov was indeed younger at the\
      \ time of his death. But wait, maybe I got the birth years wrong. Let me double-check.\
      \ \n\nAsimov: Born January 2, 1920, died April 6, 1992. So 1992 minus 1920 is\
      \ 72 years. Correct. \n\nKalam: Born October 15, 1931, died July 27, 2015. 2015\

      \ 1931 is 84, but from October 15, 1931, to October 15, 2015, is 84 years. But\
      \ he died in July 2015, which is three months before his birthday. So he was\
      \ 83 years old at death. Wait, that would make him 83. So 2015 - 1931 = 84,\

      \ 9 months and 12 days. So he was 83 years old when he died. Therefore, he was\
      \ 83. \n\nSo Asimov was 72, Kalam 83. Therefore, Asimov was younger at the time\
      \ of his death. So the answer should be YES. But wait, maybe I made a mistake\
      \ in the years. Let me confirm one more time. Asimov's death age: 1992 - 1920\

      \ So that's not a full 84 years because he died before his birthday in 2015.\
      \ Let me subtract: 2015 - 1931 = 84, but since his birthday is in October and\

      \ So 2015 minus 1931 is 84, but since he died a few months before his birthday,\

      \ From December 1775 to December 1816 is 41 years, then from December 1816 to\

      \ old. But depending on how you count, sometimes it's rounded up. But even if\
      \ she was 42, that's still younger than Marx's 65.\n\nKarl Marx: Born May 5,\

      \ months. From May 1818 to May 1882 is 64 years. Then from May 1882 to March\
      \ 1883 is 10 months, making him 64 years and 10 months old. But again, the standard\

      \ So, I need to figure out whether Jane Austen was younger when she died compared\
      \ to Karl Marx when he died. Hmm. Okay, first things first, I should probably\
      \ find out the birth and death years of both individuals. Let me start with\
      \ Jane Austen.\n\nJane Austen, the famous English novelist, right? I remember\
      \ she lived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Let me confirm. She was\
      \ born on December 16, 1775, and died on July 18, 1817. So to calculate her\
      \ age at death, I'll subtract her birth year from her death year: 1817 minus\
      \ 1775. That's 42 years. But wait, she was born in December and died in July,\
      \ so she hadn't reached her 42nd birthday yet. Wait, no\u2014December to July\
      \ would mean she was 41 years and 7 months old. So her age at death would be\
      \ 41 years old, right? Because you don't count the year until the birthday.\
      \ So 1817 - 1775 = 42, but since her birthday was in December and she died in\
      \ July, she was 41 years old. Hmm, but sometimes people just subtract the years\
      \ and might say 42. I need to be precise here. If she was born in 1775, then\
      \ in 1817, she would have turned 42 in December, but she died in July, so she\
      \ was 41 years old at death. Okay, got that.\n\nNow onto Karl Marx. He's the\
      \ philosopher, economist, and socialist revolutionary. His lifespan is later\
      \ than Austen's. I think he was born in 1818 and died in 1883. Let me check.\
      \ Yes, Karl Marx was born on May 5, 1818, and died on March 14, 1883. So his\
      \ age at death would be 1883 minus 1818. That's 65 years. Again, considering\
      \ the birth and death months. He was born in May and died in March, so he hadn't\
      \ had his 65th birthday yet. So 1883 - 1818 is 65, but subtracting the dates:\
      \ from May 5, 1818, to March 14, 1883. So he was 64 years and about 10 months\
      \ old. So his age at death would be 64 years. Wait, but the calculation by years\
      \ would be 65, but because he died before his birthday, it's 64. Wait, no: if\
      \ you're born in 1818, then in 1883, you would be 65 minus 1 if your birthday\
      \ hasn't occurred yet. So March 14 is before May 5, so he was 64 years old at\
      \ death. So his age is 64. Wait, but sometimes people might just do 1883 - 1818\
      \ = 65. But the accurate way would be 64. Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me do the\
      \ math properly.\n\nFrom May 5, 1818, to May 5, 1883, is exactly 65 years. But\
      \ Marx died on March 14, 1883, which is about two months before his 65th birthday.\
      \ So he was 64 years old, and would have turned 65 in May. Therefore, his age\
      \ at death was 64 years. So Jane Austen died at 41, Marx at 64. Therefore, Jane\
      \ Austen was younger at her time of death than Karl Marx was at his. So the\
      \ answer should be YES.\n\nWait, let me double-check the dates because sometimes\
      \ I might mix them up. Jane Austen: 1775-1817. Karl Marx: 1818-1883. So Jane\
      \ died in 1817, when Marx was not even born yet (since he was born in 1818).\
      \ So that's not the point; the question is about their ages at their respective\
      \ times of death. So yes, Jane died at 41, Marx at 64. Therefore, yes, Jane\

    2ef3c110-adcf-4003-9eae-97c6d094d5d3: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The user wants to know if Jane Austen was younger at the time\
      \ of her death than Karl Marx was when he died. Okay, first, I need to recall\
      \ the birth and death years of both individuals. \n\nStarting with Jane Austen.\
      \ I remember she's a famous English novelist from the 19th century. If I'm not\
      \ mistaken, she was born in 1775 and died in 1817. Let me confirm that. Yes,\
      \ Jane Austen's birth date is December 16, 1775, and she died on July 18, 1817.\
      \ So, calculating her age at death: 1817 minus 1775 equals 42 years old.\n\n\
      Now, Karl Marx. He's a philosopher known for his works on communism. His birth\
      \ year is 1818, I think. Wait, but if Austen died in 1817 and Marx was born\
      \ in 1818, that means Marx was born a year after Austen died. Interesting. Marx's\
      \ death year, if I recall correctly, is 1883. Let me check: Karl Marx was born\
      \ May 5, 1818, and died March 14, 1883. To find his age at death: 1883 minus\
      \ 1818 is 65 years. \n\nSo, Jane Austen died at 41 (since her birthday is in\
      \ December and she died in July, maybe she was 41 years and 7 months?) Wait,\
      \ actually 1817 minus 1775 is 42, but depending on the exact months, she might\
      \ have been 41 if her birthday hadn't occurred yet. Wait, her birthday is December\
      \ 16, and she died July 18. So from December 16, 1775, to July 18, 1817, she\
      \ was 41 years old, because she hadn't reached her 42nd birthday yet. Let me\
      \ calculate that. From 1775 to 1817 is 42 years, but since she died in July\
      \ before her December birthday, she was 41 years, 7 months old. So her age at\
      \ death is 41.\n\nWait, but sometimes in these historical contexts, they might\
      \ just subtract the years and not account for the exact months. Let me verify\
      \ that. Okay, Jane Austen's age is commonly stated as 41 when she died. So 1775\
      \ to 1817 is 42 years, but since her birthday is in December and she died in\
      \ July, she would have been 41. So that's 41 years old.\n\nKarl Marx was born\
      \ in 1818 and died in 1883. 1883 minus 1818 is 65 years. So Marx was 64 years\
      \ old (if he died before his birthday) or 65. His birth date is May 5, 1818,\
      \ and death date March 14, 1883. So from May 5, 1818, to March 14, 1883: he\
      \ hadn't reached his 65th birthday yet. So 64 years and around 10 months. But\
      \ again, in historical records, it's often given as 64 years. But I think most\
      \ sources list his age at death as 64. Wait, wait, 1883 minus 1818 is 65, but\
      \ since March comes before May, he was 64 years old. So, 64 years.\n\nBut wait,\
      \ perhaps I should double-check. Let's do the exact calculation. If he was born\
      \ on May 5, 1818, and died on March 14, 1883, then in 1883, he would have turned\
      \ 65 on May 5. Since he died in March, he was 64 years and 10 months old. So\

      \ at her time of death than Karl Marx was at his."
    30cc2b9c-217a-44a8-845d-53e295423cf6: '<think>Okay, let''s see. The question is
      whether Jane Austen was younger at her time of death than Karl Marx was at his.
      Hmm. So I need to find out when each of them was born and when they died, then
      calculate their ages at death and compare.


      First, Jane Austen. I know she was an English novelist from the 19th century.
      I think she wrote Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. From what I
      remember, she died relatively young. Let me try to recall her birth and death
      years. I think she was born in 1775. And her death... I believe she died in
      1817. Wait, that would make her... 41 or 42 years old? Let me check that math.
      If she was born in December 1775 and died in July 1817, then she was 41 years
      old, right? Because 1817 minus 1775 is 42, but if her birthday was after July,
      she would be 41. I''m not sure about the exact months, but around that.


      Now Karl Marx. He''s the philosopher, economist, known for The Communist Manifesto.
      He''s 19th century as well, but lived a bit later. His birth year... I think
      it''s 1818. And he died in 1883. So 1883 minus 1818 is 65 years old. Wait, 1818
      to 1883: let me calculate. 1883 - 1818 = 65. So he was 65 when he died.


      So Jane Austen died at 41 or 42, Karl Marx at 65. Therefore, yes, Jane Austen
      was younger at her death than Marx was at his. So the answer is YES. But wait,
      I should make sure the dates are correct. Let me verify quickly. Jane Austen:
      born 16 December 1775, died 18 July 1817. So from December 1775 to July 1817.
      1817 - 1775 = 42, but since she died in July, before her birthday in December,
      she was 41 years old. So 41. Correct. Karl Marx: born 5 May 1818, died 14 March
      1883. 1883 - 1818 = 65. But March is before May, so he would be 64 years old
      at death? Wait, that can''t be. If he was born in May 1818, and died in March
      1883, then he had not yet turned 65. So 1883 - 1818 is 65, but his 65th birthday
      would be in May 1883. Since he died in March, he was 64 years old. Wait, now
      I''m getting conflicting numbers. So maybe my initial calculation was wrong.


      Wait this is important. For precise age calculation, it''s the date of birth
      and date of death. So:


      Jane Austen: 16 Dec 1775 to 18 Jul 1817. Let''s compute the age. From 16 Dec
      1775 to 16 Dec 1816 is 41 years. Then from 16 Dec 1816 to 18 Jul 1817 is 7 months
      and 2 days. So she was 41 years, 7 months, and 2 days old. So 41 years old.


      Karl Marx: 5 May 1818 to 14 Mar 1883. From 5 May 1818 to 5 May 1882 is 64 years.
      Then from 5 May 1882 to 14 Mar 1883 is 10 months and 9 days. So he was 64 years,
      10 months, 9 days old. So 64 years old. Wait, but 1883 - 1818 is 65, but because
      he hadn''t reached his birthday in 1883, he was 64 at death.


      So Jane Austen died at 41, Karl Marx at 64. So 41 < 64, so yes, Austen was younger.
      Therefore, the answer is YES. But I''m getting confused here because some sources
      might say Marx died at 64, others at 65. Wait, no. The exact calculation is
      necessary.


      Let me cross-verify. 1818 to 1883 is 65 years. But if he was born in May 1818
      and died March 1883, he hadn''t had his 65th birthday yet. So his age would
      be 64 years, 10 months, 9 days. Therefore, 64 years old. So the age at death
      is 64. So Jane Austen was 41, Marx 64. So yes, she was younger when she died.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.

      </think>Jane Austen was born on December 16, 1775, and died on July 18, 1817,
      making her 41 years old at the time of her death. Karl Marx was born on May
      5, 1818, and died on March 14, 1883. At his death, he was 64 years old (as he
      died two months before his 65th birthday). Since 41 is younger than 64, the
      answer is:


      **YES**'

      \nJane Austen: Born December 16, 1775, died July 18, 1817. So from 1775 to 1817.\
      \ Let's calculate her exact age. From 1775 to 1817 is 42 years. She was 41 years\
      \ and about 7 months old when she died. So 41 years old? Wait, wait, when you\

      \ is 7 months. Therefore, she was 41 years and 7 months old when she died. So\
      \ she was 41, not 42. Hmm, I might have made a mistake there.\n\nWait, so the\
      \ calculation is: 1817 minus 1775 equals 42, but if she died before her birthday\
      \ in that final year, she would be 41. Let me confirm. Jane Austen was born\
      \ on December 16, 1775, and died on July 18, 1817. So in 1817, her birthday\
      \ was in December, but she died in July, so she hadn't reached her 42nd birthday\
      \ yet. Therefore, her age at death was 41 years old.\n\nNow Karl Marx: born\
      \ May 5, 1818, died March 14, 1883. Let's calculate his age. 1883 minus 1818\
      \ is 65. But his birthday is in May, so by March 14, 1883, he hadn't turned\
      \ 65 yet. Wait, so he was 64 years old? Let's see: from May 5, 1818, to May\
      \ 5, 1883, is 65 years. But he died on March 14, 1883, which is about a month\
      \ and a half before his 65th birthday. So he was 64 years old at death. Wait,\
      \ that contradicts my initial thought. So maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait,\
      \ this is important. Let me do the math properly for both.\n\nJane Austen:\n\
      \nBirth: December 16, 1775\n\nDeath: July 18, 1817\n\nFrom December 16, 1775,\
      \ to December 16, 1816, that's exactly 41 years. Then from December 16, 1816,\
      \ to July 18, 1817, that's 7 months and 2 days. So she was 41 years, 7 months,\
      \ and 2 days old when she died. So her age was 41.\n\nKarl Marx:\n\nBirth: May\
      \ 5, 1818\n\nDeath: March 14, 1883\n\nFrom May 5, 1818, to May 5, 1882, that's\
      \ 64 years. Then from May 5, 1882, to March 14, 1883, that's 10 months and 9\
      \ days. So his age at death was 64 years, 10 months, and 9 days. So he was 64\
      \ years old when he died.\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then Jane Austen\
      \ died at 41, Marx at 64. So Austen was younger at death than Marx. Wait, but\
      \ this contradicts my initial thought that Marx was 65. So perhaps I made a\
      \ mistake in the initial subtraction. Because 1883 minus 1818 is 65, but since\
      \ he died before his birthday in 1883, he was 64.\n\nSo the correct ages: Austen\
      \ 41, Marx 64. Therefore, yes, Austen was younger at her death than Marx was\
      \ at his. So the answer would be YES.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure. Maybe\
      \ I should look up exact ages if I can recall correctly. Alternatively, maybe\
      \ there's a miscalculation here. Let's check another way.\n\nFor Jane Austen:\
      \ 1775 to 1817 is 42 years. If she died before her birthday, she's 41. Since\
      \ her birthday is in December and she died in July, yes, 41.\n\nFor Marx: 1818\
      \ to 1883 is 65 years. But he died in March, before his birthday in May, so\
      \ 64.\n\nTherefore, Austen died at 41, Marx at 64. Therefore, YES, she was younger\
      \ at death.\n</think>Jane Austen was born on December 16, 1775, and died on\
      \ July 18, 1817, making her 41 years old at the time of her death (as she died\

      \ That would be 36 years old. But wait, since his birthday is in February and\

      \ - 1819. That's 82 years. However, her birthday is in May, and she died in\
      \ January, so she hadn't turned 83 yet. So she was 81 years old when she died?\
      \ Wait, no. Let me double-check. If she was born in May 1819, then in May 1900\
      \ she would have been 81. But she died in January 1901, so she was 81 years\
      \ old at death? Wait, 1901 minus 1819 is 82, but because she died before her\
      \ birthday in 1901, she was 81 years and about 8 months old. So her age would\
      \ be 81 years, right?\n\nWait, no. Let me actually compute the exact age. From\
      \ May 24, 1819, to May 24, 1900, is exactly 81 years. Then from May 24, 1900,\
      \ to January 22, 1901, is another 8 months or so. So her age at death was 81\
      \ years plus about 8 months, but since we count age in completed years, she\
      \ was 81 years old. Wait, but sometimes people subtract the birth year from\

    d1d832e4-57b6-4e5f-9e67-db722459065a: '<think>Okay, let''s try to figure out if
      Bob Marley was younger when he died than Queen Victoria was when she died.


      First, I need to find out both of their birth and death years. Let me start
      with Bob Marley. I remember he was a famous reggae musician from Jamaica. I
      think he died relatively young. Wasn''t his death in the early 80s? Let me check...
      Oh right, Bob Marley was born on February 6, 1945, and he died on May 11, 1981.
      So to calculate his age at death: 1981 minus 1945. That''s 36 years old. Wait,
      because his birthday was in February, so by May he would have been 36. Yeah,
      that''s correct.


      Now Queen Victoria. She was the British monarch, right? She had a long reign.
      I know she became queen in 1837 and ruled until her death. I think she lived
      into the early 20th century. Let me recall. Queen Victoria was born on May 24,
      1819. She died on January 22, 1901. So her age at death would be 1901 minus
      1819. That''s 82 years old. But wait, she was born in May and died in January,
      so she didn''t reach her 82nd birthday yet. So actually, she was 81 years old
      when she died. Wait, no: 1901 minus 1819 is 82, but since her birthday is in
      May and she died in January, she was 81 years and 8 months old. So her age would
      be 81 years. But sometimes when calculating age, even if the birthday hasn''t
      occurred yet in the year of death, you subtract the birth year from the death
      year and then subtract one if the birthday hadn''t passed. Wait, for example,
      if someone was born in 2000 and died in 2020 before their birthday, their age
      is 19. So Victoria''s birth year is 1819, death 1901. 1901-1819=82, but since
      she died in January before her May birthday, she was 81 years old. Hmm, but
      some sources might just say 81. Let me confirm. Actually, she was born in 1819,
      so 1901-1819=82, but she died before her birthday, so 81 years old. But wait,
      wait, 1901 - 1819 = 82 years, but she hadn''t turned 82 yet, so she was 81.
      Yeah, that makes sense.


      So Bob Marley was 36, Queen Victoria was 81. Therefore, Bob Marley was indeed
      younger at the time of his death than Queen Victoria was at hers. So the answer
      is YES.

      </think>Bob Marley was born in 1945 and died in 1981 at age 36. Queen Victoria
      was born in 1819 and died in 1901; subtracting her birth year from her death
      year gives 82, but since she died in January before her May birthday, she was
      81 years old. Thus, Bob Marley was younger at his death than Queen Victoria
      at hers.


      YES'

      \ Roosevelt was born on October 27, 1858. His death year... I think he died\
      \ in 1919, maybe January 6? Let me check. Yes, he died on January 6, 1919. So\
      \ calculating his age: 1919 minus 1858. Let's see, 1858 plus 60 would be 1918,\
      \ so 1918 minus 1858 is 60, then plus 1 year makes 61. Wait, because 1919 -\
      \ 1858: 1858 to 1918 is 60 years, so 1919 is 61. But he died in January 1919,\
      \ and his birthday is in October. So if he died in January, he hadn't turned\
      \ 61 yet. Wait, his birth date is October 27, 1858. So in January 1919, he would\
      \ still be 60 years old, right? Because he hadn't reached his birthday in October.\
      \ So 1919 minus 1858 is 61, but since he died in January, he was 60 years and\
      \ a few months old. So age at death: 60 years old.\n\nWait, let me make sure.\
      \ If you're born on October 27, 1858, how old are you on January 6, 1919? From\

      \ recall the birth and death years of both historical figures. Let's start with\
      \ Sim\xF3n Bol\xEDvar. From what I remember, he was a key figure in South American\
      \ independence movements. I think he was born in the late 18th century, maybe\
      \ 1783? And he died in the 1830s, perhaps 1830. Wait, actually, I might be mixing\

      \ was born on July 24, 1783, and he died on December 17, 1830. So that would\
      \ make him 47 years old when he died. Let me confirm that calculation: 1783\
      \ to 1830 is 47 years. Since he died in December, and his birthday is in July,\
      \ he had already turned 47 that year. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, Theodore\
      \ Roosevelt. He was a U.S. president, right? I know he became president after\
      \ McKinley was assassinated, so around 1901. His birth year, if I recall correctly,\
      \ was 1858. Let's see, he was born on October 27, 1858, and died on January\
      \ 6, 1919. Wait, so calculating his age at death: from 1858 to 1919 is 61 years.\
      \ But since his birthday is in October and he died in January, he hadn't turned\
      \ 61 yet in 1919. Wait, no: 1919 minus 1858 is 61 years, but he died in January\
      \ before his birthday in October. So he would have been 60 years old. Wait,\
      \ let's do the math properly. He was born on October 27, 1858. So on October\
      \ 27, 1918, he turned 60. Then he died on January 6, 1919, which is a few months\
      \ after his 60th birthday. Wait, no, January 1919 is before October 1919. Wait,\
      \ no, January comes before October. So if he died in January 1919, he was still\
      \ 60 years old, because his 61st birthday would have been in October 1919. So\
      \ his age at death would be 60 years old. Wait, is that correct? Let me check\
      \ again. If you are born in 1858 and die in 1919, subtract 1858 from 1919, which\
      \ is 61 years. But if the death date is before the birthday in the death year,\

      \ when they died.\n\nFirst, I need the birth and death years for both figures.\
      \ Let me recall what I know about them. Sim\xF3n Bol\xEDvar was a South American\
      \ revolutionary leader. I think he was involved in the independence movements\
      \ of several countries like Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, etc. His nickname\
      \ was \"The Liberator.\" As for his lifespan, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact dates.\
      \ Maybe he was born in the late 18th century? I remember he died relatively\
      \ young, perhaps in his 40s or 50s. Let me check my memory: I think he was born\
      \ in 1783. And died in 1830. Let me verify that. If born in 1783 and died in\
      \ 1830, that would make him 47 years old at death.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt, the\
      \ US president, I know he was born in 1858 and died in 1919. Wait, no, did he\
      \ die in 1919? Or was that after his presidency? Wait, Theodore Roosevelt became\
      \ president after McKinley was assassinated in 1901, served until 1909. Then\
      \ he ran again in 1912 as a third-party candidate but lost. His death was a\
      \ few years later. I think he died in 1919. So if he was born in 1858 and died\
      \ in 1919, that would make him 60 years old. Let me do the math: 1919 minus\
      \ 1858 is 61 years. Wait, 1858 to 1918 is 60 years, so adding one more year\
      \ would be 61. So he was 60 years old when he died? Wait, let's recalculate.\
      \ Birth year 1858, death year 1919. Subtract 1858 from 1919: 1919 - 1858 = 61\
      \ years. But sometimes people might make a mistake with the exact months. For\
      \ instance, if he was born in October 1858 and died in January 1919, he would\
      \ still be 60 years old. But assuming the exact years, 61 years old.\n\nWait,\
      \ Bol\xEDvar: 1783 to 1830. 1830 minus 1783 is 47. So 47 years old. Roosevelt\
      \ would be 61. Therefore, Bol\xEDvar was younger at the time of death. So the\
      \ answer would be YES, because 47 is less than 61.\n\nBut wait, let me make\
      \ sure I have the correct dates. Let me think again. Sim\xF3n Bol\xEDvar's dates:\
      \ born July 24, 1783, died December 17, 1830. So that's 47 years and about 5\
      \ months. Theodore Roosevelt was born October 27, 1858, died January 6, 1919.\
      \ So calculating his age: 1919 minus 1858 is 61 years, but from October 27,\
      \ 1858, to January 6, 1919, that's 60 years and a couple of months. So actually,\
      \ he was 60 years old when he died. Because from October 27, 1858, to October\
      \ 27, 1918, he turns 60. Then he dies on January 6, 1919, which is 2 months\
      \ and 10 days after his 60th birthday. So he was 60 years, 2 months old. Therefore,\
      \ 60 years old. So Bol\xEDvar was 47, Roosevelt 60. So yes, Sim\xF3n Bol\xED\

      var was younger at death.  \n\n**Answer**: YES"
    256eccf3-36da-4546-b6be-a5a8c7dcf9b7: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Sim\xF3n Bol\xEDvar was younger at the time of his death than Theodore\
      \ Roosevelt. Hmm, I need to figure out their ages when they died and compare\
      \ them. \n\nFirst, I should recall their birth and death years. Let me start\
      \ with Sim\xF3n Bol\xEDvar. I think he was a South American revolutionary leader.\
      \ From what I remember, he was born in 1783. When did he die? I believe he died\
      \ in 1830. So if he was born in 1783 and died in 1830, that would make him 47\
      \ years old, right? Let me check the math: 1830 minus 1783. 1830 - 1780 is 50,\
      \ then subtract 3 more years gives 47. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, Theodore\
      \ Roosevelt. He was a U.S. president, the 26th, I think. His lifespan... He\
      \ was born in 1858 and died in 1919. Wait, 1919 minus 1858. Let's calculate\
      \ that. 1858 to 1900 is 42 years, then add 19 more to reach 1919, so 42 + 19\
      \ = 61. So he was 60 years old when he died? Wait, 1858 + 60 would be 1918,\
      \ but he died in 1919. So maybe 61? Let me do the exact calculation: 1919 minus\
      \ 1858. 1858 + 60 = 1918, so 1919 is 61 years. So he was 60 years old at death?\
      \ Wait, no. If you're born in October 1858 and die in January 1919, you'd be\
      \ 60 years and a few months. But depending on the exact dates, maybe 60 or 61.\
      \ But I think the standard answer is that he died at 60. Wait, let me confirm.\
      \ 1858 to 1918 is 60 years. So if he died in 1919, it's 60 years plus one year,\
      \ so 61. Wait, no. If his birth year is 1858, then in 1918 he turns 60, and\
      \ in 1919 he would be 61. But if he died in January 1919, before his birthday,\
      \ he would still be 60. So I need the exact dates. Let me recall: Theodore Roosevelt\
      \ was born on October 27, 1858, and died on January 6, 1919. So from October\
      \ 27, 1858, to October 27, 1918, he's 60. He died on January 6, 1919, which\
      \ is a few months after his 60th birthday. Wait, no, October comes after January.\
      \ So from October 27, 1858, to January 6, 1919: he would have had his 60th birthday\
      \ in October 1918, so by January 1919, he's 60 years and a few months. So his\
      \ age at death is 60 years old. So he was 60 when he died.\n\nSo Sim\xF3n Bol\xED\

      \ years old. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    619013cd-a9a1-4b2d-b9ae-c5da3955c17c: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The question is whether Sim\xF3n Bol\xEDvar was younger at the\

      \ and when they died. Let me start with Sim\xF3n Bol\xEDvar. I remember he was\
      \ a key figure in South American independence. I think he was born in the late\
      \ 18th century. Let me recall... I believe his birth year was 1783. And he died\

      \ me check: 1783 plus 47 would be 1830. Yes, that adds up.\n\nNow, Theodore\
      \ Roosevelt. He was a US president, right? I know he was born in 1858 and died\
      \ in 1919. Let me confirm that. Yes, he was the 26th president, and he died\
      \ in 1919. So his lifespan is 1858 to 1919. Calculating his age: 1919 minus\
      \ 1858. Let's subtract: 1919 - 1858. 1858 plus 60 is 1918, so 60 years gets\
      \ us to 1918, and then one more year to 1919. So that's 61 years. Wait, actually,\
      \ 1919 minus 1858. Let me do the math properly. 1919 minus 1858. 1858 + 60 =\
      \ 1918, so 1918 is 60 years. Then 1919 is 61 years. So Roosevelt was 60 years\
      \ old when he died? Wait, no. Wait, if you're born in 1858, in 1919 you would\
      \ be 61 years old. Because from October 27, 1858, to January 6, 1919 (if that's\
      \ his death date), but maybe I should just go with the years. Let's check: 1919\
      \ - 1858 = 61 years. So if he was born in 1858 and died in 1919, he was 61.\
      \ Hmm, but sometimes there's a nuance if the death date is before the birthday\

      \ with the simple subtraction. So 61 years old.\n\nWait, wait, I think Roosevelt\
      \ died at 60. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. 1858 to 1919. Let's\
      \ calculate 1919 minus 1858. 1858 + 61 = 1919. So yes, that's 61. But maybe\
      \ the exact date matters. For example, if he was born in October 1858 and died\
      \ in January 1919, he would have been 60 years old, because his 61st birthday\
      \ would be in October 1919, and he died in January. Let me confirm the exact\
      \ dates. I recall Roosevelt was born on October 27, 1858, and died on January\
      \ 6, 1919. So, from October 27, 1858, to October 27, 1918, he turned 60. He\
      \ died on January 6, 1919, which is 3 months after his 60th birthday. So he\
      \ was 60 years, 2 months, and a few days old. So his age at death was 60. Therefore,\
      \ the initial calculation based on years alone (61) was incorrect because of\
      \ the exact dates. So he was 60 when he died.\n\nSo now, Sim\xF3n Bol\xEDvar\
      \ died at 47, and Roosevelt at 60. Therefore, Bol\xEDvar was younger at his\
      \ time of death than Roosevelt. So the answer would be YES.\n</think>Sim\xF3\

      n Bol\xEDvar was younger at his time of death than Theodore Roosevelt. \n\n\
      **ANSWER: YES**"
    7a747a19-47ae-497f-bce1-4c44fa78d8a3: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The question is whether Sim\xF3n Bol\xEDvar was younger at the\
      \ time of his death than Theodore Roosevelt was when he died. Okay, so I need\
      \ to find out the ages of both historical figures when they died and compare\
      \ them.\n\nFirst, I should recall or look up their birth and death years. Sim\xF3\
      n Bol\xEDvar is a key figure in South American history, known for leading several\
      \ countries to independence from Spain. I think he was born in the late 18th\
      \ century. Let me check... Yeah, Sim\xF3n Bol\xEDvar was born on July 24, 1783.\
      \ His death year was 1830. To find his age at death, I subtract 1783 from 1830.\
      \ That would be 1830 - 1783 = 47 years old. So Bol\xEDvar died at 47.\n\nNow,\
      \ Theodore Roosevelt. He's one of the U.S. presidents, right? I remember he\
      \ was the 26th president, serving from 1901 to 1909. Let me confirm his birth\
      \ and death years. He was born on October 27, 1858, and died on January 6, 1919.\
      \ Calculating his age at death: 1919 - 1858 = 61 years old. But wait, his birthday\
      \ is in October, and he died in January, so he hadn't turned 61 yet? Let me\
      \ check that. If he was born in 1858, in 1919, he would have been 61 years old\
      \ only after October 27. Since he died on January 6, 1919, he was still 60 years\
      \ old. Wait, that's a common mistake. Let me verify. Subtracting 1858 from 1919\
      \ gives 61, but if the death occurred before his birthday in that year, he would\
      \ still be 60. So January 6 is before October 27, so he was 60 when he died.\
      \ Wait, but sometimes the calculation is done by just subtracting the years.\
      \ Let me make sure. For example, someone born in 2000 and died in 2020 before\
      \ their birthday would be 19, not 20. So same here: 1919 - 1858 = 61, but subtract\
      \ one because he hadn't had his birthday in 1919 yet. So 60 years old. But I'm\
      \ a bit confused because some sources might just use the year difference. Let\
      \ me check a reliable source. According to Theodore Roosevelt's biography, he\
      \ was born in 1858 and died in 1919 at the age of 60. So yes, he was 60 years\
      \ old when he died. Wait, but now I'm getting conflicting information. Let me\
      \ calculate again. 1919 (death year) minus 1858 (birth year) equals 61. However,\
      \ since his birthday is in October and he died in January, he was 60 years and\
      \ about 2.5 months old. So his age at death is 60 years. Therefore, TR was 60\
      \ when he died.\n\nSo now, comparing the two. Bol\xEDvar was 47, Roosevelt was\
      \ 60. Therefore, Sim\xF3n Bol\xEDvar was indeed younger at the time of his death\
      \ than Theodore Roosevelt. So the answer is YES.\n\nWait, hold on, let me double-check\
      \ the dates again. Sim\xF3n Bol\xEDvar's birth: 1783, death 1830. 1830 -1783\
      \ is 47. Correct. TR: born 1858, died 1919. 1919-1858 is 61, but he died before\
      \ his birthday, so 60. So yes, 47 vs 60. So yes, Bol\xEDvar was younger. Therefore,\
      \ the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Sim\xF3\

      \ from Spain. I think he was born in the late 18th century. Wait, was it 1783?\
      \ Yeah, that sounds right. And he died in 1830. Let me confirm that. So if he\

      \ Theodore Roosevelt. He was a US President, right? The 26th president. His\

      \ If he was born in 1858 and died in 1919, subtract 1858 from 1919. That's 61\
      \ years. So he was 61 when he died.\n\nComparing the two: Bol\xEDvar was 47,\
      \ Roosevelt was 61. So the question is whether Bol\xEDvar was younger when he\
      \ died than Roosevelt. Since 47 is less than 61, the answer would be YES. But\
      \ wait, let me double-check the dates in case I made a mistake. \n\nSim\xF3\
      n Bol\xEDvar: Born July 24, 1783, died December 17, 1830. So 1830 minus 1783\
      \ is indeed 47. Let's confirm the exact age. From July 24, 1783, to July 24,\
      \ 1830, that's 47 years. Then he died in December, so it's 47 years and about\
      \ 5 months. So age 47.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt: Born October 27, 1858, died January\
      \ 6, 1919. So from 1858 to 1919 is 61 years. From October 1858 to October 1918\
      \ is 60 years, then from October 1918 to January 1919 is 3 months, so 60 years\
      \ and 3 months. But wait, if he died in January 1919, was he 60 or 61? Wait,\
      \ 1919 minus 1858 is 61 years. So because even if he died in January, the birth\
      \ year 1858 to death year 1919 is 61 years. So his exact age would be 60 years\
      \ and a few months, but since the question is about age at death, which is calculated\
      \ as death year minus birth year, adjusted if the birthday hadn't occurred yet\
      \ in the death year. Let's see: he was born October 27, 1858. Died January 6,\
      \ 1919. So on January 6, 1919, he had already had his birthday in 1918 (October\
      \ 27, 1918), so he turned 60 in 1918. Then from October 27, 1918, to January\
      \ 6, 1919, he's 60 years old. So his age at death was 60 years, 2 months, and\
      \ 10 days or so. Wait, that would make him 60, not 61. Did I mess up the calculation?\n\
      \nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's do it step by step. If he was born\
      \ in 1858, then in 1859 he turned 1. So each year adds one. So 1919 minus 1858\
      \ is 61 years. But depending on the exact date, if the death occurred before\
      \ his birthday in 1919, he would be 60. But he died in January 1919, and his\
      \ birthday is in October. So he hadn't turned 61 yet. Therefore, his age at\
      \ death would be 60 years, because he was born in 1858, and up to January 1919,\
      \ he would have lived 60 full years. So 1919 - 1858 = 61, but because he died\
      \ before his birthday, subtract 1, making 60. So he was 60 when he died. \n\n\
      Wait, that's conflicting. Let me check a reliable source. According to Theodore\
      \ Roosevelt's biography, he was born on October 27, 1858, and died on January\
      \ 6, 1919. So from October 27, 1858, to October 27, 1918, he turned 60. Then\
      \ died in January 1919, so his age was 60 years, 2 months, and 10 days. Therefore,\
      \ his age at death was 60, not 61. So earlier calculation was wrong. Thus, he\
      \ was 60 when he died.\n\nWait, but some sources might list his age as 60. So\
      \ that changes things. So Sim\xF3n Bol\xEDvar died at 47, Roosevelt at 60. Therefore,\
      \ yes, Bol\xEDvar was younger. But wait, the initial assumption was 61 vs 47,\

      \ Let me verify this again. Birth year 1858, death year 1919. So 1919-1858 =\

    fbcc7fa1-1ebc-4c1b-ad46-934cd7e3af0f: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure this out.\
      \ The question is whether Sim\xF3n Bol\xEDvar was younger when he died compared\

      \ time of death.\n\nFirst, I should recall the birth and death years of each\
      \ person. Let me start with Sim\xF3n Bol\xEDvar. From what I remember, he was\
      \ a key figure in South American independence. I think he was born in 1783.\
      \ When did he die? I believe he died relatively young, maybe in his 40s or 50s.\
      \ Let me confirm: Bol\xEDvar was born on July 24, 1783, and died on December\
      \ 17, 1830. So, calculating his age: 1830 minus 1783 gives 47 years old. Wait,\
      \ but he was born in July and died in December, so he was 47 years old when\
      \ he died.\n\nNow, Theodore Roosevelt. He was a US president, right? His birth\
      \ year is 1858, I think. When did he die? I recall he died in 1919. Let me check:\
      \ born October 27, 1858, died January 6, 1919. So subtracting 1858 from 1919\
      \ gives 61 years, but since his birthday is in October and he died in January,\
      \ he would have been 60 years old. Wait, 1919 minus 1858 is 61, but he died\
      \ before his birthday in 1919. So from October 27, 1858, to October 27, 1918,\
      \ he turned 60. Then from October 1918 to January 1919, he's 60 until his next\

      \ role in the independence of several countries like Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador,\
      \ Peru, and Bolivia. His death\u2014I think it was in 1830. So if he was born\
      \ in 1783 and died in 1830, that would make him 47 years old.\n\nNow, Theodore\
      \ Roosevelt. He was a U.S. president. I know he was the 26th president, serving\

      \ died in 1919, that would be 1919 minus 1858. Let's calculate that: 1919 -\

      \ he died in the 1960s, maybe 1961? And he was born around the turn of the century.\
      \ Let me check. Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899. He died on July 2, 1961.\
      \ So to calculate his age at death: 1961 minus 1899. Let's do the math. 1961\
      \ - 1899 = 62 years. But wait, his birthday is in July, and he died in July.\
      \ Wait, he died on July 2nd, which is before his birthday on July 21st. So he\
      \ was 61 years old when he died, right? Because he hadn't turned 62 yet. So\
      \ 61 years old.\n\nNow Johan Cruyff, the Dutch footballer. I know he was more\
      \ recent. He was born in 1947, I think. Let me confirm. Johan Cruyff was born\
      \ on April 25, 1947. He died on March 24, 2016. So his age at death would be\
      \ 2016 minus 1947. 2016 - 1947 = 69 years. But again, his birthday is in April,\
      \ and he died in March, so he hadn't turned 70 yet. So he was 68 years old?\
      \ Wait, wait. Let me calculate that properly. From April 25, 1947, to March\
      \ 24, 2016. So he was 68 years and 11 months, which means 68 years old. Wait,\
      \ no. If you subtract 1947 from 2016, that's 69 years, but since he died before\
      \ his birthday in 2016, he was 68 years old. Wait, no, 2016 minus 1947 is 69,\
      \ but if he died before his birthday, he was 68. Let me check: 1947 + 68 = 2015.\
      \ So by April 25, 2015, he would have been 68. Then from April 25, 2015, to\
      \ March 24, 2016, he was 68 years old, and died just shy of 69. So his age at\
      \ death was 68 years, 11 months. But in terms of completed years, he was 68.\
      \ Wait, but sometimes people count the year difference. Let me confirm. If you're\

      \ that's 2016 minus 1947 is 69, but since his birthday was in April, and he\

      \ 61 years old at the time of death. But usually, when stating age, it's the\
      \ number of completed years. So even though he was close to 62, he was 61 when\
      \ he died. But some sources might round up. Wait, no, it's calculated by subtracting\
      \ the birth year from the death year and then adjusting if the birthday hadn't\
      \ occurred yet. So 1961 - 1899 = 62, but since he died before his birthday in\
      \ 1961, he was 61. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check. For example,\
      \ if someone is born on July 21, 1999, and dies on July 2, 2021, how old are\
      \ they? They would be 2021 - 1999 = 22 years, but since they died before their\
      \ birthday in 2021, they were 21. So same applies here. So 1961 - 1899 = 62,\
      \ but since he died before July 21, 1961, he was actually 61 years old. Wait,\
      \ that's conflicting. So Hemingway's age at death is 61. Let me confirm via\
      \ a trusted source. Quick check: Hemingway was born July 21, 1899, died July\
      \ 2, 1961. That's 61 years, 11 months, and 11 days. So he was 61. So then he's\
      \ 61. Then Johan Cruyff was born April 25, 1947, died March 24, 2016. 2016 -\
      \ 1947 = 69, but he died before his birthday in 2016, so 68 years old. So 61\

    7e81dc51-4c7f-4aef-81b4-afc7287510c7: '<think>Alright, let''s tackle this question.
      So, the question is whether Ernest Hemingway was younger at the time of his
      death than Johan Cruyff was when he died. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure
      out the birth and death years of both individuals, then calculate their ages
      at death, and compare them.


      Starting with Ernest Hemingway. I remember he was an American writer, famous
      for novels like "The Old Man and the Sea." I think he died in the 1960s. Let
      me recall... I believe he was born in 1899. His death, wasn''t it by suicide?
      Maybe around 1961. Let me confirm. Yes, Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899,
      and died on July 2, 1961. So, to calculate his age at death: 1961 minus 1899.
      That would be 62 years, but since his birthday was in July and he died in July,
      subtracting the dates: he was just a few days short of his 62nd birthday. So
      he was 61 years old when he died.


      Now, Johan Cruyff. He was a famous Dutch footballer, right? A legend in soccer.
      I''m not as sure about his dates. Let me think. He played in the 1970s and 80s.
      I think he was born in the late 1940s. Wait, Johan Cruyff was born on April
      25, 1947. When did he die? I recall it was more recent, maybe around 2016. Let
      me check. Yes, he passed away on March 24, 2016. So calculating his age: 2016
      minus 1947. That''s 69 years. But since his birthday is in April and he died
      in March, he hadn''t turned 69 yet. So he was 68 years old at the time of his
      death.


      Comparing the two: Hemingway was 61, Cruyff was 68. So Hemingway was indeed
      younger at the time of his death than Cruyff. Therefore, the answer should be
      YES.

      died on March 24, 2016, making him 68 years old at death. Since 61 is younger
      than 68, the answer is:

      First, I should recall the birth and death years of both individuals. Let''s
      start with Ernest Hemingway. I know he was an American author, famous for books
      like "The Old Man and the Sea." From what I remember, he was born in 1899. His
      death... I think he died in the 1960s. Was it 1961? I''m pretty sure he died
      by suicide, maybe in Idaho. So if he was born in 1899 and died in 1961, that
      would make him 61 or 62 years old when he died. Let me check the math: 1961
      minus 1899. Subtracting 1900 from 1961 gives 61, but since 1899 is one year
      before 1900, adding that one year back, it would be 61 + 1 = 62. Wait, no, that''s
      not right. If he was born in July 1899 and died in July 1961, that''s exactly
      62 years. But if he died earlier in the year than his birthday, he would be
      61. Hmm, but I''m not sure about the exact dates. However, for the sake of this
      question, maybe the exact day isn''t necessary if the years are enough. Let''s
      go with 1961 - 1899 = 62 years old. I think that''s accurate.


      Now, Johan Cruyff. He was a Dutch football legend, right? I''m less sure about
      his dates. He was a prominent player in the 1970s, I believe. Let me think.
      He was born in 1947? And died more recently. I recall his death was around 2016.
      Let me confirm. Yes, Johan Cruyff was born on April 25, 1947, and died on March
      24, 2016. So calculating his age at death: 2016 minus 1947. That''s 69 years.
      But wait, he died in March, which is before his birthday in April. So 2016 -
      1947 = 69, but since he hadn''t turned 69 yet (his birthday is in April), he
      was 68 years old when he died. Wait, that''s important. Let''s check: if you''re
      born in 1947 and die in 2016 before your birthday, you subtract 1947 from 2016
      and then subtract one more year. So 2016 - 1947 = 69, minus 1 = 68. But actually,
      no, that''s not the right way. It''s better to count the exact years. If he
      died on March 24, 2016, and his birthday is April 25, 1947, then up to March
      24, 2016, he was 68 years and 11 months old. So he was 68 years old at the time
      of death. Therefore, Johan Cruyff was 68, and Hemingway was 61 or 62. Wait,
      wait, wait, wait. Wait, this conflicts with my initial thought. If Hemingway
      was 62 and Cruyff was 68, then Hemingway was younger. But wait, let me double-check
      because I might have mixed up the numbers.


      Wait, let''s redo both calculations carefully:


      Ernest Hemingway:

      Born: July 21, 1899

      Died: July 2, 1961

      Wait, if he was born on July 21, 1899, and died on July 2, 1961, he hadn''t
      yet reached his 62nd birthday. So the exact age would be 61 years old. Because
      from July 21, 1899, to July 21, 1960, is 61 years. Then from July 21, 1960,
      to July 2, 1961, is 346 days, which is just shy of another year. Therefore,
      Hemingway was 61 years old when he died.


      Johan Cruyff:

      Born: April 25, 1947

      Died: March 24, 2016

      From April 25, 1947, to April 25, 2015, that''s 68 years. Then from April 25,
      2015, to March 24, 2016, is 11 months, so he was 68 years old at death. Therefore,
      Cruyff was 68, Hemingway was 61. So the answer would be YES, Hemingway was younger
      at the time of death than Cruyff.


      Wait, but I thought Hemingway was 61, Cruyff 68. So yes, Hemingway was younger.
      Therefore, the answer is YES. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me
      confirm the exact dates.


      Checking Hemingway''s death date: He was born July 21, 1899. He died July 2,
      1961. So from July 21, 1899, to July 21, 1960, is exactly 61 years. Then, from
      July 21, 1960, to July 2, 1961, is 346 days (since 1960 is a leap year, February
      had 29 days). So 346 days is about 11 months and 11 days. Therefore, he was
      61 years old when he died.


      Johan Cruyff was born April 25, 1947. Died March 24, 2016. From April 25, 1947,
      to April 25, 2015, is 68 years. From April 25, 2015, to March 24, 2016, is 334
      days (since from April 25, 2015, to April 25, 2016, is a year, so subtracting
      31 days (March 24 to April 25 is 31 days minus 1 day because March 24 is before
      April 25: 31 days difference? Wait, March has 31 days, so March 24 to March
      31 is 7 days, then April 1 to April 25 is 25 days. Total 7 + 25 = 32 days. So
      365 - 32 = 333 days. So he was 68 years and 333 days old. So he was still 68,
      not 69. Therefore, at death, Cruyff was 68, Hemingway was 61. So Hemingway was
      younger. Therefore, the answer is YES.

      </think>Ernest Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899, and died on July 2, 1961.
      Calculating his age at death: he was 61 years old (just shy of his 62nd birthday).
      Johan Cruyff was born on April 25, 1947, and died on March 24, 2016. He was
      68 years old at death (having not yet reached his 69th birthday). Since 61 is
      younger than 68, Hemingway was indeed younger at the time of his death than
      Cruyff.


      **ANSWER: YES**'
    9849ce35-92d4-4341-afe0-0ae6debc12ba: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure this out.\
      \ The question is whether Ernest Hemingway was younger when he died than Johan\
      \ Cruyff was at his death. So I need to find the ages of both at their time\
      \ of death and compare them.\n\nFirst, I should recall their birth and death\
      \ years. Let me start with Ernest Hemingway. From what I remember, Hemingway\
      \ was an American writer known for novels like \"The Old Man and the Sea.\"\
      \ He was born in 1899, I think. His death was a suicide, right? So he died in\
      \ 1961. Let me check those dates in my mind. Yeah, Hemingway was born July 21,\
      \ 1899, and died July 2, 1961. So to calculate his age at death: 1961 minus\
      \ 1899. Let's see, 1961 - 1899. Subtract 1900 from 1961, that's 61, then add\
      \ 1 because it's 1899 instead of 1900. So 61 + 1 = 62. Wait, but he died in\
      \ July 1961, and was born in July 1899. So on July 21, 1961, he would have turned\
      \ 62, but he died on July 2, which is 19 days before his birthday. So he was\
      \ 61 years and 11 months old, which technically makes him 61 years old at death.\
      \ Hmm, but sometimes when people calculate age, they just subtract the years.\
      \ Let me confirm that. If he was born in 1899 and died in 1961, the age would\
      \ be 61 or 62? Let's do the exact calculation: 1961 - 1899 = 62, but since he\
      \ died before his birthday, he was 61. So his age at death is 61 years.\n\n\
      Now Johan Cruyff. He was a Dutch footballer, a legendary player. I think he\
      \ was born in 1947. His death was more recent. I believe he died in 2016. Let\
      \ me verify. Johan Cruyff was born on April 25, 1947, and died on March 24,\
      \ 2016. So to calculate his age: 2016 minus 1947. That's 69 years. But again,\
      \ checking the exact dates. He died in March 2016, and his birthday is in April.\
      \ So he died a month before his 69th birthday, so he was 68 years old at the\
      \ time of death. Wait, 2016 minus 1947 is 69, but since he hadn't reached his\
      \ birthday yet, it's 68. So his age would be 68. Wait, let's do the math: 1947\
      \ + 68 = 2015. So 1947 + 68 years is 2015, so in 2016, he would be 69 if he\
      \ had lived past April. But he died in March 2016, so he was 68 years, 11 months.\
      \ So his age at death is 68 years.\n\nWait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let\
      \ me check again. If you're born in 1947, in 2016 you would be 2016 - 1947 =\
      \ 69. But if your birthday is in April and you die in March, you haven't turned\
      \ 69 yet. So you subtract 1, making it 68. So Cruyff was 68, and Hemingway was\
      \ 61. So Hemingway was younger when he died than Cruyff? Wait, no. Wait, 61\
      \ vs. 68. So 61 is younger than 68. So Hemingway was 61, Cruyff 68. So YES,\
      \ Hemingway was younger at death than Cruyff. Wait, that seems surprising because\
      \ Cruyff is more modern, but perhaps Hemingway died relatively young. But let\
      \ me make sure I have the dates right.\n\nWait, Hemingway: 1899 to 1961. So\
      \ 1961 - 1899 = 62. But because he died in July 2, 1961, before his July 21\
      \ birthday, he was 61. Correct. Cruyff: 1947 to 2016. 2016 - 1947 = 69. But\
      \ he died March 24, 2016, before his April 25 birthday. So 68. So 61 vs 68.\
      \ So Hemingway was younger. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step\
      \ Explanation:**  \n1. **Ernest Hemingway's Age at Death:**  \n   - Born: July\
      \ 21, 1899  \n   - Died: July 2, 1961  \n   - Calculation: Died 19 days before\

    cca9fc6d-6dc9-48f3-aef9-2b257785721d: '<think>Okay, let''s see. The question is
      whether Ernest Hemingway was younger when he died compared to Johan Cruyff at
      the time of his death. Hmm, I need to figure out their birth and death years
      first, then calculate their ages at death and compare them.


      First, Ernest Hemingway. I remember he was a famous American writer. I think
      he was born in 1899. When did he die? I recall he died by suicide. Maybe in
      the 1960s? Oh right, he died in 1961. So if he was born in 1899 and died in
      1961, his age would be 1961 minus 1899. Let me do that math: 1961 - 1899 = 62.
      So Hemingway was 62 when he died.


      Now Johan Cruyff. He was a Dutch football player, right? I''m not as sure about
      his dates. Let me think. He was a big name in the 1970s and maybe into the 80s.
      I think he was born in the late 1940s. Wait, Johan Cruyff was part of the Netherlands''
      "Total Football" team in the 1974 World Cup. If he was in his prime then, maybe
      he was in his late 20s. So born around 1947? Let me check in my mind. Actually,
      I think he was born in 1947. When did he die? I remember it was more recent,
      maybe 2016. So if he was born in 1947 and died in 2016, his age would be 2016
      - 1947. Let''s calculate that: 2016 minus 1947. 1947 + 69 = 2016, so he was
      69 years old when he died.


      So Hemingway died at 62, Cruyff at 69. Therefore, Hemingway was younger when
      he died. So the answer should be YES.

      </think>Ernest Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899, and died on July 2, 1961,
      making him 61 years old at death. Johan Cruyff was born on April 25, 1947, and
      died on March 24, 2016, making him 68 years old at death. Since 61 is younger
      than 68, the answer is YES.

      \ and died in July 1961, that's exactly 62. But if the death was earlier in\
      \ the year than his birthday, he would be 61. I'm not sure the exact dates.\

      \ years old. Wait, 1947 to 2016 is 69 years, but since he died in March and\

    744aa323-8f39-4177-820d-3d143d1911c9: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure this out.\
      \ The question is whether Hugo Ch\xE1vez was younger when he died compared to\
      \ Nikola Tesla's age at his death. So I need to find out both their birth years\
      \ and death years, then calculate their ages at death and compare them.\n\n\
      First, Hugo Ch\xE1vez. I know he was the president of Venezuela. Let me recall\
      \ when he died. I think he passed away around 2013. As for his birth year, I\
      \ believe he was born in 1954. Let me check that in my mind. Yes, Hugo Ch\xE1\
      vez was born on July 28, 1954, and died on March 5, 2013. So to calculate his\
      \ age at death: 2013 minus 1954. Let me subtract. 2013 minus 1950 is 63, then\
      \ subtract 4 more years gives 59. But wait, his birthday is in July, and he\
      \ died in March. So he hadn't turned 59 yet. So actually, he was 58 years old\
      \ when he died. Because from July 1954 to March 2013, he would have been 58\
      \ years and about 7 months. So age 58.\n\nNow Nikola Tesla. He's a historical\
      \ figure, inventor, electrical engineer. His death was much earlier. I think\
      \ he died in the 1940s. Wait, no, maybe earlier. Let me think. Tesla was born\
      \ in 1856, I believe. And he died in 1943. Let me confirm. Yes, Tesla was born\
      \ on July 10, 1856, and died on January 7, 1943. So his age at death would be\
      \ 1943 minus 1856. Let's calculate that. 1856 + 87 = 1943. So 87 years old.\
      \ Wait, but again considering the birth and death dates. He was born in July\
      \ 1856, died in January 1943. So he lived from 1856 to 1943, but in January\
      \ 1943, he hadn't reached his 87th birthday yet. Wait, wait, 1943 minus 1856\
      \ is 87 years, but since he died in January, before his July birthday, he was\
      \ actually 86 years old. Let me check that math again. If he was born July 10,\
      \ 1856, then on July 10, 1942, he would turn 86. From July 1942 to January 1943\
      \ is 6 months, so he was 86 years and 6 months when he died. So his age at death\
      \ was 86 years.\n\nWait, but some sources might say 86, others 87? Maybe depending\
      \ on how it's calculated. But the exact calculation would be 1943 - 1856 = 87,\
      \ but since he died before his birthday, subtract one. So 86. Therefore, Tesla\
      \ was 86 years old when he died.\n\nSo now comparing the two. Hugo Ch\xE1vez\
      \ was 58, Tesla was 86. Therefore, yes, Ch\xE1vez was younger at his time of\
      \ death than Tesla was at his. So the answer is YES.\n</think>Hugo Ch\xE1vez\

      \ So, the question is whether Hugo Ch\xE1vez was younger at the time of his\

      \ out the birth and death years of both individuals and then calculate their\
      \ ages at death to compare.\n\nStarting with Hugo Ch\xE1vez. I remember he was\
      \ the President of Venezuela and passed away a few years ago. Let me recall...\
      \ I think he died in 2013. His birth year, if I'm not mistaken, was 1954. So,\
      \ if he died in 2013, subtracting 1954 from 2013 gives 59 years old. Wait, but\
      \ I should double-check that. Let me confirm: Ch\xE1vez was born on July 28,\
      \ 1954, and died on March 5, 2013. So, from 1954 to 2013 is 59 years, but since\
      \ his birthday is in July and he died in March, he hadn't turned 59 yet. Wait,\
      \ no, 2013 minus 1954 is 59, but since he died in March, which is before his\
      \ July birthday, he was actually 58 years old at the time of death. Wait, that's\
      \ a common mistake. Let me calculate it properly. From July 28, 1954, to March\
      \ 5, 2013. So, 2013 - 1954 = 59 years, but he died before his 59th birthday.\
      \ So, he was 58 years old. Hmm, but sometimes people might just subtract the\
      \ years and not account for the exact months. I need to be precise here. Let's\
      \ see: 1954 + 58 = 2012. So, his 58th birthday was in July 2012. He died in\
      \ March 2013, which is 8 months after his 58th birthday. So, he was 58 years\
      \ old. Therefore, his age at death was 58.\n\nNow, Nikola Tesla. He was a famous\
      \ inventor. I think he lived a long life. Let me recall his dates. Tesla was\
      \ born on July 10, 1856, and died on January 7, 1943. So, calculating his age\
      \ at death: 1943 minus 1856. Let's do the math. 1856 + 87 = 1943. So, 1943 -\
      \ 1856 = 87 years. But wait, his birthday is in July, and he died in January\
      \ 1943, which is before his birthday in July. So, he was 86 years old at the\
      \ time of death. Because from July 10, 1856, to July 10, 1942, he would be 86,\
      \ and then he died in January 1943, which is 6 months before his 87th birthday.\
      \ So, Tesla was 86 years old when he died.\n\nWait, but some sources might say\
      \ 86 or 87. Let me confirm. Tesla's birth year is 1856, death 1943. 1943 - 1856\
      \ = 87. But since he died in January, before his July birthday, he was 86. So,\
      \ 86 years old. Therefore, Ch\xE1vez was 58, Tesla was 86. So, 58 is younger\
      \ than 86. Therefore, YES, Hugo Ch\xE1vez was younger at his time of death than\
      \ Nikola Tesla was at his.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I didn't mix up\
      \ the dates. Let me check again. Ch\xE1vez: 1954-2013. 2013 - 1954 = 59, but\
      \ since he died in March, before his July birthday, he was 58. Tesla: 1856-1943.\

      From what I remember, Catherine II, also known as Catherine the Great, ruled
      Russia in the 18th century. She was born in 1729, I think. Her death... wasn''t
      she in her 60s? Maybe around 1796? Let me check that. If she was born in 1729
      and died in 1796, that would make her 67 years old at death. Let me confirm:
      1796 minus 1729 is 67. Yeah, that sounds right.


      Now, Robert Mugabe. He was a more recent leader of Zimbabwe. When did he die?
      I believe he was quite old. He was born in 1924, I think. And he died in 2019.
      So calculating his age: 2019 minus 1924 is 95 years old. So he was 95 when he
      died.


      Comparing the two, Catherine II was 67 at death, Mugabe was 95. So yes, Catherine
      was younger when she died. Therefore, the answer should be YES.

      </think>Catherine II of Russia was born in 1729 and died in 1796, making her
      67 years old at her death. Robert Mugabe was born in 1924 and died in 2019,
      living to 95 years old. Since 67 is younger than 95, **YES**, Catherine II was
      younger at her time of death than Robert Mugabe.'
    40f1b3b5-01e9-473f-b4e6-a5aa69b79c0d: '<think>Okay, let''s figure out if Catherine
      II of Russia was younger when she died compared to Robert Mugabe.


      First, I need to find the birth and death years for both. Let''s start with
      Catherine II. I remember she''s also known as Catherine the Great. She was a
      Russian empress in the 18th century. I think she was born in 1729. When did
      she die? I recall she ruled for a long time, maybe until the late 1700s. I think
      she died in 1796. Let me confirm: yes, Catherine the Great was born on May 2,
      1729, and died on November 17, 1796. So calculating her age at death: 1796 minus
      1729 is 67 years. She was 67 when she died.


      Now Robert Mugabe. He was a more recent leader of Zimbabwe. I know he was in
      power for a long time, stepping down in 2017. His death was in recent years.
      Let me check his birth year. Mugabe was born in 1924, on February 21. He died
      on September 6, 2019. So his age at death: 2019 minus 1924 is 95 years. Wait,
      2019 minus 1924. Let''s calculate: 1924 +95 = 2019. Yes, that''s correct. So
      he was 95 when he died.


      Comparing the two ages: Catherine II was 67, Mugabe was 95. So Catherine was
      indeed younger at her time of death than Mugabe. Therefore, the answer should
      be YES.

      </think>Catherine II of Russia was born in 1729 and died in 1796, making her
      67 years old at the time of her death. Robert Mugabe was born in 1924 and died
      in 2019, living to 95 years old. Since 67 is younger than 95, the answer is
      YES.


      ANSWER: YES'
    59951dbc-5e4b-4eca-ac31-1c328cfdba91: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the question is: Was Catherine II of Russia younger at her time of death\
      \ than Robert Mugabe at his time of death? I need to figure out the answer step\
      \ by step.\n\nFirst, I should find out when each of them died and how old they\
      \ were. Let's start with Catherine II. She's also known as Catherine the Great.\
      \ From what I remember, she was a prominent Russian empress in the 18th century.\
      \ I think she ruled for a long time. Her birth year might be 1729, and she died\
      \ in 1796. Let me confirm that. Yes, she was born on May 2, 1729, and died on\
      \ November 17, 1796. So to find her age at death, subtract 1729 from 1796. Let's\
      \ see, 1796 minus 1729. That's 67 years. Wait, but her birthday is in May, and\
      \ she died in November, so she was 67 years old when she died.\n\nNow, Robert\
      \ Mugabe. He was a more recent figure. He was the president of Zimbabwe. I recall\
      \ he was in office for a very long time, until he was quite old. He died in\
      \ 2019, I believe. Let me check his birth and death dates. Mugabe was born on\
      \ February 21, 1924, and died on September 6, 2019. To calculate his age at\
      \ death: 2019 minus 1924 is 95 years. But since he died in September and was\
      \ born in February, he had already had his birthday in 2019, so he was 95 years\
      \ old when he died.\n\nNow, comparing the two ages: Catherine II was 67, Mugabe\
      \ was 95. So Catherine was indeed younger at the time of her death than Mugabe.\
      \ Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n\nWait, let me double-check the dates\
      \ to make sure I didn't mix up anything. Catherine's birth 1729, death 1796:\
      \ 1796-1729 = 67. Mugabe's birth 1924, death 2019: 2019-1924 = 95. Yes, that's\
      \ correct. So the answer is YES.\n</think>YES. **Catherine II of Russia** was\
      \ born in 1729 and died in 1796 at age **67**. **Robert Mugabe** was born in\
      \ 1924 and died in 2019 at age **95**. Since 67 < 95, Catherine was younger\
      \ at her death than Mugabe. \n\n**Answer:** YES."

      First, Catherine the Great. I remember she was an 18th-century Russian empress.
      When did she die? I think she reigned from like 1762 until her death. I might

      \ The question is whether Che Guevara was younger when he died than Vasco da\
      \ Gama was at his death. Okay, first I need to find out the ages of both historical\
      \ figures at the time of their deaths. \n\nFirst, Che Guevara. I know he was\
      \ a revolutionary in the 20th century. I think he died in the 1960s. Wait, he\
      \ was executed in Bolivia, right? Let me check the dates. Che was born on June\
      \ 14, 1928. His death was on October 9, 1967. So, calculating his age: 1967\
      \ minus 1928 is 39 years. Wait, but since his birthday is in June, and he died\
      \ in October, he would have already turned 39 that year. So he was 39 years\
      \ old when he died.\n\nNow Vasco da Gama. He was a Portuguese explorer, right?\
      \ Known for finding a sea route to India. Let me recall his lifespan. Vasco\
      \ da Gama was born around 1460s, I think. His exact birth year is a bit uncertain,\
      \ but most sources say 1460 or 1469. Let me verify. According to what I remember,\
      \ he was born in 1469. Wait, no, some sources say 1460. That's a problem because\
      \ if there's a discrepancy in his birth year, that might affect the calculation.\
      \ Let's check. He died in 1524. If he was born in 1460, he would be 64 when\
      \ he died (1524 - 1460 = 64). If he was born in 1469, then 1524 - 1469 = 55.\
      \ That's a big difference. So which one is correct? Wait, I need to be careful\
      \ here. From what I recall, most sources nowadays list his birth year as around\
      \ 1460-1469. Wait, no, maybe more precise. Let me think. Vasco da Gama's first\
      \ voyage to India was in 1497-1499. If he was in his late 20s or early 30s at\
      \ that time, that would place his birth around 1469 (since 1497 - 30 = 1467).\
      \ But some older sources might say 1460. Hmm. Let me check with some quick references.\
      \ Okay, according to Encyclopedia Britannica, Vasco da Gama was born around\
      \ 1460 in Sines, Portugal, and died on December 24, 1524, in Cochin, India.\
      \ So if he was born in 1460, then 1524 - 1460 = 64 years old. But wait, some\
      \ sources might give a different birth year. Let me confirm. For example, the\
      \ Portuguese government's official records or historical consensus. Let me think\u2014\
      when he was appointed to lead the expedition in 1497, he was considered experienced\
      \ enough, so maybe older. If he was born in 1460, he would have been 37 when\
      \ he started his famous voyage, which seems plausible. Alternatively, some sources\
      \ say 1469, which would make him 28, which is also possible. But according to\
      \ Britannica, it's 1460. So assuming that's accurate, his age at death would\
      \ be 64. \n\nSo Che Guevara died at 39, Vasco da Gama at 64. Therefore, Che\

      \ confusion about Vasco's birth year, maybe some sources differ. Let me check\
      \ another source. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy might not have him,\
      \ but a quick search in my mind: Vasco da Gama's birth year is often cited as\
      \ 1469, but some earlier sources say 1460. Wait, now I'm confused. Let me try\
      \ to recall. For example, his tomb inscription might have his age at death.\
      \ He died in 1524. If his birth year was 1469, he would be 55. If 1460, 64.\
      \ Which is correct? Actually, after some research, there was a controversy regarding\
      \ his birth year. Recent studies based on his signature and other documents\
      \ suggest he was born in 1469. So perhaps it's 1469. Let me confirm. According\
      \ to the Portuguese chronicler Gaspar Correia, he was 28 when he sailed in 1497,\
      \ which would place his birth in 1469. That seems more plausible. So 1524 -\
      \ 1469 = 55 years old. So if that's the case, Vasco da Gama died at 55. Then\
      \ Che Guevara died at 39. So 39 is younger than 55. Therefore, YES, Che was\
      \ younger. \n\nBut wait, there's conflicting information. So the answer depends\
      \ on the correct birth year of Vasco da Gama. If it's 1460, he was 64; if 1469,\
      \ 55. The question requires a definite answer. Since the user expects a YES/NO\
      \ answer, perhaps the commonly accepted dates. Let me check again. On Britannica,\
      \ it says \"born c. 1460, Sines, Portugal\u2014died December 24, 1524, Cochin,\
      \ India.\" So approximately 1460. However, other sources like Wikipedia state\
      \ his birth as 1469. The discrepancy comes from different historical records.\
      \ The earlier date (1460) is based on traditional accounts, while more recent\
      \ studies suggest 1469. For the purpose of this question, perhaps the answer\
      \ hinges on which date is correct. But since the user is asking for a clear\
      \ YES/NO, and the question is about historical figures, perhaps using the commonly\
      \ cited dates. If using 1460, then the answer is YES (Che was 39 vs. 64). If\
      \ using 1469, still YES (39 vs.55). Either way, Che was younger. Therefore,\
      \ the answer is YES.\n</think>Che Guevara was born on June 14, 1928, and died\

      \ is 1469. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look up the exact dates. But since\
      \ I can't, I have to rely on my memory. I think the correct answer is that Vasco\

    1ffddc29-9aef-4a9c-a111-e62a7a8da63b: '<think>Okay, let''s see. The question is
      asking whether Che Guevara was younger when he died compared to Vasco da Gama
      when he died. Hmm, I need to find out both their ages at death and compare them.


      First, I should figure out when each of them was born and when they died. Let''s
      start with Che Guevara. I remember he was a revolutionary in the mid-20th century.
      I think he was born in 1928. When did he die? I recall he was executed in Bolivia,
      maybe in 1967. So if he was born in 1928 and died in 1967, that would make him
      39 years old. Let me check that math: 1967 minus 1928 is 39. Yeah, that seems
      right.


      Now Vasco da Gama. He was a Portuguese explorer, right? He''s famous for the
      sea route to India. I''m a bit fuzzy on the exact dates. I think he lived during
      the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Let me recall. Vasco da Gama made his
      first voyage to India in 1498. When was he born? I think around 1460s. Let''s
      say 1469 maybe? And when did he die? I remember he died in India, possibly during
      his third voyage. I think he died in 1524. So if he was born in 1469 and died
      in 1524, that would make him 55 years old. Wait, 1524 minus 1469 is 55. Does
      that add up? 1469 plus 55 is 1524. Yes, that seems correct.


      Wait, but I''m not 100% sure about Vasco da Gama''s exact birth and death years.
      Let me double-check. Quick search in my mind: Vasco da Gama was born around
      1460-1469. He died on December 24, 1524, in Kochi, India. His birth year is
      commonly cited as 1469. So 1524 minus 1469 is 55. So he was 55 when he died.


      Che Guevara was 39. So the question is: Was Che Guevara younger at his time
      of death than Vasco da Gama? Comparing 39 and 55. Yes, 39 is younger than 55.
      So the answer should be YES.

      </think>Che Guevara was born in 1928 and died in 1967 at age 39. Vasco da Gama
      was born around 1469 and died in 1524 at age 55. Since 39 is younger than 55,
      the answer is YES.

      \ So the question is: Was Che Guevara younger at the time of his death than\

      \ death years for both individuals. Then calculate their ages at death and compare\
      \ them.\n\nStarting with Che Guevara. I remember he was a revolutionary in the\
      \ mid-20th century. I think he died in the 1960s. Let me recall... Che Guevara\
      \ was born in 1928 and died in 1967. Let me confirm. Yes, Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara\
      \ was born on June 14, 1928, and died on October 9, 1967. So his age at death\
      \ would be 1967 minus 1928. Let me calculate that: 1967 - 1928 = 39 years old.\
      \ Wait, wait. If he was born in June 1928 and died in October 1967, that's 39\
      \ years and a few months, so he was 39 years old when he died.\n\nNow, Vasco\
      \ da Gama. He was a Portuguese explorer. From history, he was the first European\
      \ to reach India by sea. His voyages were around the late 15th and early 16th\
      \ centuries. I think he was born around 1460s. Let me check. Vasco da Gama was\
      \ born around 1460 or 1469. His death year... He died in 1524. Wait, his exact\
      \ birth year is a bit uncertain, but most sources say around 1460 or 1469. Let\
      \ me get precise here. For example, if he was born in 1469 and died in 1524,\
      \ that would make him 55 years old. If born in 1460, he would be 64. But some\
      \ sources might differ. Wait, I need to verify. Checking known facts: Vasco\
      \ da Gama was born circa 1460 or 1469 in Sines, Portugal. The exact year is\
      \ debated. However, the most commonly cited birth year is 1469. If he died in\
      \ 1524, then 1524 - 1469 = 55. So 55 years old. But if it's 1460, then 1524-1460=64.\
      \ So which is more accurate? Let me check a reliable source. According to Encyclopedia\
      \ Britannica, Vasco da Gama was born around 1460. Hmm, but other sources vary.\
      \ Wait, maybe it's better to use the commonly accepted dates. For example, the\
      \ Portuguese government's historical records might have more precise data. Wait,\
      \ but maybe I should check both possibilities. However, the exact birth year\
      \ is a point of contention. Let's see: Britannica says he was born in 1460/1469?\
      \ Let me check. Quick search: Vasco da Gama's birth year is often cited as 1469,\
      \ but some historians argue for an earlier date, like 1460. For example, his\
      \ commission as a captain in 1492 required him to be at least 25, which would\
      \ place his birth year around 1469. But if he was born in 1460, he would have\
      \ been 32 in 1492, which fits. There's a debate, but the 1469 date is more commonly\
      \ used in many sources. However, if he died in 1524, then using 1469 gives 55,\
      \ which is the figure often cited. But some sources might say he was 64. This\
      \ discrepancy could affect the answer. \n\nSo, assuming the commonly accepted\
      \ 1469 birth year, he would be 55. If 1460, 64. But the key is which one is\
      \ correct. Let me check a few sources. The Wikipedia entry for Vasco da Gama\
      \ states he was born in 1460 or 1469. However, the article notes that the 1469\
      \ date is based on a 16th-century Portuguese historian's account, while other\
      \ evidence suggests an earlier birthdate. For example, his father's records\
      \ from 1478 mention Vasco as a teenager, which would support a birth around\
      \ 1460-1465. Therefore, more recent scholarship tends to favor around 1460.\
      \ If he was born around 1460 and died in 1524, that would make him approximately\
      \ 64 years old. \n\nSo, depending on the birth year, his age at death could\
      \ be either around 55 or 64. However, the answer hinges on this. Che Guevara\
      \ was 39. So if Vasco da Gama was 55 or 64, either way, he was older than Che\
      \ Guevara when he died. Therefore, Che was younger at his time of death than\
      \ Vasco da Gama. So the answer is YES.\n</think>Che Guevara was born in 1928\
      \ and died in 1967 at the age of 39. Vasco da Gama, born around 1460 (with some\

      \ birth year (1469), he would have been 55 at death, and older if born earlier.\

      asking whether Che Guevara was younger when he died compared to Vasco da Gama
      at his time of death. Hmm, I need to figure out both of their ages at death
      and then compare them.


      First, I should find out when each of them was born and when they died. Let
      me start with Che Guevara. From what I remember, Che was a revolutionary in
      the mid-20th century. I think he was involved in the Cuban Revolution alongside
      Fidel Castro. His full name is Ernesto "Che" Guevara. I believe he died in the
      1960s. Let me try to recall his birth and death years. If I''m not mistaken,
      he was born in 1928. His death year... was it 1967? Yes, that''s right. The
      CIA assisted in his capture and execution in Bolivia in 1967. So if he was born
      in 1928 and died in 1967, his age at death would be 1967 minus 1928. Let me
      do that math: 1967 - 1928 = 39 years old. Wait, 1928 + 39 would be 1967. Yes,
      that checks out. So Che was 39 when he died.


      Now, Vasco da Gama. He was a Portuguese explorer, right? From the Age of Discovery.
      He''s famous for being the first European to reach India by sea, which I think
      was around the late 15th or early 16th century. Let me get his dates. I think
      he was born around 1460s and died in the early 1500s. Wait, Vasco da Gama''s
      expedition to India was in 1498 when he sailed around the Cape of Good Hope.
      Let me look up his birth and death years. Wait, but I can''t actually look it
      up now, so I need to rely on memory. If he was born in 1460 or 1469, and died
      in 1524. Let me check that. Wait, I think he died in India, maybe in Cochin.
      So if he was born in 1469 and died in 1524, that would make him 1524 - 1469
      = 55 years old. Wait, 1469 plus 55 is 1524. That seems right. So Vasco da Gama
      would have been 55 when he died.


      So comparing the two, Che Guevara died at 39, Vasco da Gama at 55. Therefore,
      Che was indeed younger at the time of his death than Vasco da Gama. So the answer
      should be YES.

      \ out the birth and death years of both individuals. Let me start with Che Guevara.\
      \ From what I remember, Che Guevara was a prominent Marxist revolutionary in\
      \ the mid-20th century. I think he was born in 1928. His death\u2014I recall\

      \nNow, Vasco da Gama. He's a historical figure from the Age of Exploration.\
      \ He was a Portuguese explorer who found the sea route to India. His expeditions\
      \ were in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. I'm a bit fuzzy on exact dates.\
      \ Let me think. Vasco da Gama's first voyage to India was in 1497-1499. So he\
      \ was probably born around the 1460s. I think his birth year is 1460 or 1469.\
      \ Wait, checking my memory\u2014some sources say he was born around 1460. As\
      \ for his death, I believe he died in 1524, possibly in India. So if he was\
      \ born in 1460 and died in 1524, that would make him 64 years old.\n\nWait,\
      \ but I might be mixing up some details. Let me double-check the dates. Che\
      \ Guevara: born June 14, 1928, died October 9, 1967. So 1967 minus 1928 is 39\
      \ years old. Vasco da Gama: born around 1460 (some sources say 1469, but more\
      \ commonly 1460), died December 24, 1524. If born in 1460, then 1524 - 1460\
      \ = 64. If born in 1469, then 1524 - 1469 = 55. Wait, there's a discrepancy\
      \ here. So maybe I need to confirm the exact birth year. From what I recall,\
      \ Vasco da Gama's birth year is often cited as around 1460\u20131469, but the\
      \ exact year is uncertain. However, looking it up, some sources state his birth\
      \ year as 1469. If that's the case, 1524 minus 1469 is 55. But other sources\
      \ say 1460. Hmm. So this might be a point of confusion. \n\nBut in many historical\
      \ references, his birth is around 1460. For example, Encyclopedia Britannica\
      \ lists his birth as c. 1460, death 1524. So 64 years old. If that's accurate,\
      \ then Che Guevara was 39 and Vasco da Gama was 64. Therefore, Che was younger\
      \ when he died.\n\nAlternatively, if Vasco was born in 1469, he'd be 55, which\
      \ is still older than Che's 39. Either way, Che was younger. Therefore, the\
      \ answer would be YES.</think>Che Guevara was born on June 14, 1928, and died\

    efe70137-fa86-444a-863e-fb585eedf1e0: '<think>Okay, let''s see. The question is
      whether Che Guevara was younger when he died compared to Vasco da Gama when
      he died. Hmm, I need to figure out their ages at death and compare them.


      First, I should recall when each of them was born and when they died. Let''s
      start with Che Guevara. I think he was a revolutionary in the mid-20th century.
      I remember he was involved in the Cuban Revolution with Fidel Castro. So his
      death year... wasn''t he killed in Bolivia? Maybe in the 1960s? Let me think.
      Che Guevara was captured and executed in 1967. His birth year... I think he
      was born in 1928. So if he died in 1967, that would make him 39 years old. Wait,
      1967 minus 1928 is 39. Yeah, that sounds right.


      Now, Vasco da Gama. He was a Portuguese explorer, right? He''s famous for finding
      the sea route to India. His time was much earlier. I think he lived in the late
      15th to early 16th century. Let me get his dates. Vasco da Gama was born around
      1460-something. His death year... I believe he died in 1524. Let me check that.
      If he was born in 1469 and died in 1524, then his age at death would be 1524
      minus 1469. Let''s calculate that: 1524 - 1469 = 55. So he was 55 when he died.


      Comparing the two: Che Guevara was 39, Vasco da Gama was 55. So yes, Che was
      younger at the time of his death. Therefore, the answer should be YES.

      </think>Che Guevara was born in 1928 and died in 1967 at age 39. Vasco da Gama
      was born around 1469 and died in 1524 at age 55. Since 39 is younger than 55,
      the answer is YES.

      \nStarting with Amelia Earhart. From what I remember, she was a famous aviator\
      \ who disappeared in 1937 during her attempt to fly around the world. I think\
      \ she was born in the late 1800s. Let me confirm that. Amelia Earhart was born\
      \ on July 24, 1897. She went missing on July 2, 1937, and was declared dead\
      \ on January 5, 1939. So, at the time of her disappearance, she was 39 years\
      \ old (because from July 24, 1897, to July 2, 1937, is just shy of her 40th\
      \ birthday). But since she was declared dead in 1939, technically her official\
      \ age at death would be 41, but I think the question is referring to the time\
      \ she actually died, which was in 1937. So, let's go with 39 years old.\n\n\
      Now, John Wayne. He was a famous actor, known for Westerns. I believe he lived\
      \ much longer. His real name was Marion Morrison. Let me get his dates. John\
      \ Wayne was born on May 26, 1907, and died on June 11, 1979. So, to calculate\
      \ his age at death: from 1907 to 1979 is 72 years. Then, subtracting 1907 from\
      \ 1979 gives 72 years. However, his birthday in 1979 was May 26, and he died\
      \ on June 11, so he had already turned 72 that year. So he was 72 years old\
      \ when he died.\n\nComparing the two: Amelia Earhart was 39 (or maybe 41, depending\

      \ declared dead on January 5, 1939. So her age at death would be calculated\
      \ based on 1937, since that's when she went missing. 1937 minus 1897 is 40 years.\
      \ Wait, but she was born in July, so in July 1937 she would have turned 40.\
      \ But she disappeared in early July, so just shy of her 40th birthday? Wait,\
      \ July 24 is her birthday. She disappeared on July 2, which is before her birthday.\
      \ So in 1937, on July 2, she was 39 years old, because she hadn't turned 40\

      First, I should recall when each of them died and their birth years. Let''s
      start with Amelia Earhart. I remember she was a famous aviator who disappeared
      in 1937 during her flight around the world. She was born in 1897, I think. So
      if she died in 1937, she would have been 39 or 40 years old. Wait, 1937 minus
      1897. Let me calculate that. 1897 plus 40 would be 1937, so she was 40 when
      she disappeared, right? Because 1937 minus 1897 equals 40. So Amelia Earhart
      was 40 years old at her death.


      Now, John Wayne. He was an actor, known for westerns. I''m not as sure about
      his dates. Let me think. John Wayne''s real name was Marion Morrison. He died
      in the late 70s, maybe 1979? And he was born around 1907? Let me check that.
      If he was born in 1907 and died in 1979, that would make him 72 years old. Wait,
      1979 minus 1907 is 72. But I need to confirm those dates. I think John Wayne
      died in 1979. Yes, his death year is 1979, and he was born on May 26, 1907.
      So 1979 minus 1907 is indeed 72. So he was 72 when he died.


      So comparing the two: Amelia Earhart died at 40, John Wayne at 72. So the question
      is, was Earhart younger than Wayne at their respective times of death? Yes,
      40 is younger than 72. Therefore, the answer should be YES.

      \ hadn't turned 40 yet when she disappeared. But sometimes historical records\
      \ might round it up. I need to confirm. Let's see, 1897 to 1937 is 40 years,\
      \ but since her birthday is in July, and she disappeared in July before her\
      \ birthday, she was 39. So Amelia Earhart was 39 years old when she died.\n\n\
      Now John Wayne. He was an actor, known for Westerns. I think he died in the\

      \ famous aviator who disappeared in 1937. I think she was born in 1897, but\
      \ I'm not 100% sure. So if she was born in 1897 and disappeared (which is when\

      \ me calculate that: 1937 - 1897 equals 40 years old.\n\nNow, John Wayne, the\
      \ actor known as the Duke. He was a big star in westerns. I believe he died\
      \ in the late 70s or early 80s. Maybe around 1979? Let me think. He was born\

      \ = 72 years old. \n\nWait, but I should double-check those dates. Let me verify.\
      \ Amelia Earhart's birth date is July 24, 1897, and she disappeared on July\
      \ 2, 1937. So yeah, she was 39 years old at the time, actually. Wait, 1937 minus\
      \ 1897 is 40, but since her birthday was in July and she disappeared in July,\
      \ but before her birthday. She was born on the 24th, so July 2 is earlier. So\
      \ she was 39 years and 11 months old, so 39 years old. So maybe 39 instead of\
      \ 40. \n\nJohn Wayne, born May 26, 1907, died June 11, 1979. So 1979 minus 1907\
      \ is 72 years. But again, checking the exact dates: from May 26, 1907, to June\
      \ 11, 1979. So he had just turned 72 a few weeks before his death. So 72 years\
      \ old. \n\nSo Amelia Earhart died at 39, John Wayne at 72. Therefore, yes, Amelia\
      \ was younger at her death than John Wayne was at his. \n\nBut wait, sometimes\
      \ dates can be tricky. Let me confirm again. Earhart's birth year is definitely\
      \ 1897? Yes, quick search in my mind says yes. John Wayne's birth year 1907,\
      \ correct. So calculations: 1937-1897=40, but her exact age when she died (disappeared\
      \ on July 2, 1937; born July 24, 1897) would be 39 years, 11 months, and 8 days,\

      \ Hmm, I think the official declaration was in 1939, but she likely died in\
      \ 1937. But for age calculation, it's the actual death date, even if it's uncertain.\
      \ Since she never returned after 1937, she would have been 39 or 40? Let me\
      \ verify. 1897 to 1937: 1937 - 1897 = 40. But her birthday is in July. If she\

      \ 40th birthday was later that month. But since she was never found, her age\
      \ at death is considered 39, because she didn't live past that date. But some\
      \ sources might list her age as 40 if they use the declared death date in 1939.\
      \ This is a bit confusing. Maybe I should check John Wayne's dates first and\

      \ May 26 to June 11 is a little over two weeks. So he was 72 years and about\
      \ two weeks old when he died. So he was 72.\n\nNow, Amelia Earhart's age: if\
      \ she died in July 1937 at 39 or 40, but John Wayne was 72 when he died. So\
      \ 39 or 40 is definitely younger than 72. So regardless of which exact age for\

      \ Let me think. The Crusades were around the 12th century. I think Richard I\

      \ calculate. 1199 minus 1157 is 42 years old. So he was 42 when he died.\n\n\
      Now, Agatha Christie. She's the famous mystery writer, known for books like\
      \ \"Murder on the Orient Express\" and \"And Then There Were None.\" She lived\

      \ she died.\n\nWait, so Richard I died at 42, and Agatha Christie at 86. That\
      \ would make Richard indeed younger at the time of his death than Agatha Christie.\
      \ So the answer should be YES. But let me make sure I didn't mix up any dates.\
      \ Let me double-check Richard I's dates. Born September 8, 1157, died April\

      First, I should recall who these people are. Richard I, also known as Richard\

      \nSo, I need their birth and death years. Let me start with Richard I. From\
      \ what I remember, he was born in 1157. His death... I think he died in 1199.\
      \ Let me confirm that. Yes, Richard I was born September 8, 1157, and died April\
      \ 6, 1199. So to calculate his age at death: 1199 minus 1157. That would be\
      \ 42 years old. Wait, but he was born in September and died in April, so he\
      \ hadn't turned 42 yet. Let me check: 1157 to 1199 is 42 years, but since his\
      \ birthday is in September and he died in April, he was 41 years old at death.\
      \ Hmm, maybe I should double-check that. If he was born in 1157, then in 1199,\
      \ he would have been 1199 - 1157 = 42, but if his birthday was after April 6,\
      \ he would have been 41. Since his birthday is September 8, which is after April,\
      \ he died a few months before his 42nd birthday. So he was 41 years old when\
      \ he died. Okay, that's Richard I.\n\nNow Agatha Christie. She was born September\
      \ 15, 1890, and died January 12, 1976. Let's calculate her age. 1976 minus 1890\
      \ is 86 years. But again, checking the months. She was born in September 1890,\
      \ died in January 1976. So from September 15, 1890, to September 15, 1975, she\
      \ would have been 85. Then from September 15, 1975, to January 12, 1976, that's\
      \ about 4 months. So she was 85 years old plus a few months, making her 85 when\
      \ she died. Wait, but 1976 minus 1890 is 86, but because her death was in January,\
      \ before her birthday in September, she was 85 years old. So 85 years old at\
      \ death.\n\nSo Richard I was 41, Agatha Christie was 85. Therefore, yes, Richard\

      First, I should recall who these people are. Richard I, also known as Richard\

      \ I think. Agatha Christie is the famous mystery writer from the 20th century.\
      \ \n\nSo, step one: find out when Richard I was born and when he died. Let me\
      \ think. I remember that Richard was part of the Third Crusade. He was fighting\
      \ in the late 12th century. His death... wasn't he killed by a crossbow bolt\
      \ in France? Maybe around 1199? Let me check in my mind. If he was born in 1157\
      \ and died in 1199, that would make him 42 years old. Wait, I think that's correct.\
      \ Born September 8, died April, died April 6, 1199. So subtracting 1157 from\
      \ 1199 gives 42 years old.\n\nNow Agatha Christie. She's more recent. She wrote\
      \ books like \"Murder on the Orient Express.\" She was born in 1890 and died\
      \ in 1976. Let me calculate her age. 1976 minus 1890 is 86. So she was 85 or\
      \ 86 when she died. Wait, exact dates matter. She was born September 15, 1890,\
      \ and died January 12, 1976. So from September 15, 1890, to January 12, 1976.\

    7c90417a-fe0c-4839-a8e4-2f16663d853d: '<think>Okay, let''s try to figure out if
      Richard I was younger when he died than Agatha Christie. Hmm. So I need to find
      out both of their ages at death and compare them.


      First, Richard I. I remember he''s a historical figure, maybe a king? Oh right,
      Richard the Lionheart. He was King of England, right? Let me think when he was
      born and died. If I recall correctly, he was part of the Plantagenet dynasty,
      maybe around the 12th century. Was he born in 1157? And he died in 1199. So
      if that''s right, he was 42 when he died. Let me double-check that. Yes, Richard
      I was born September 8, 1157, and died April 6, 1199. So subtracting 1157 from
      1199, that''s 42 years old. But wait, since he died in April and was born in
      September, he hadn''t turned 43 yet. So yes, 42 years old at death.


      Now Agatha Christie. She''s the famous mystery writer. She lived much more recently.
      I think she was born in 1890 and died in 1976. Let me confirm. Yes, Agatha Christie
      was born September 15, 1890, and died January 12, 1976. To calculate her age:
      1976 minus 1890 is 86. But she died in January, so she hadn''t reached her birthday
      in September. So she was 85 years old when she died. Wait, 1976 -1890 is indeed
      86, but since her birthday is in September and she died in January, she was
      85 years old. Let me make sure. 1890 +85 = 1975, so by 1975 she would have turned
      85. Then in 1976, she hadn''t had her 86th birthday yet. So she was 85 when
      she died.


      Comparing the two: Richard I was 42, Agatha Christie was 85. So yes, Richard

      </think>Richard I (the Lionheart) was born in 1157 and died in 1199, making
      him 42 years old at his death. Agatha Christie was born in 1890 and died in

      **Answer:** YES'
    96ed1130-4fbf-4cdc-a05b-e06a6099ef7d: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. So the question is: Was Richard I younger at their time of death\

      \ the ages of both Richard I and Agatha Christie when they died. Then compare\
      \ those two ages to see if Richard I was indeed younger.\n\nStarting with Richard\
      \ I. I remember he was an English king, known as Richard the Lionheart. He was\
      \ part of the Plantagenet dynasty, right? I think he lived during the 12th century.\
      \ His reign was from 1189 to 1199 if I'm not mistaken. Now, when did he die?\
      \ Let me recall. There was a siege at Ch\xE2lus in France where he was shot\
      \ by a crossbow bolt. That led to his death. I believe that happened in 1199.\
      \ So he died in 1199.\n\nNow, his birth year. Richard I was born in 1157, I\
      \ think. So if he was born in 1157 and died in 1199, his age at death would\
      \ be 1199 minus 1157. Let's calculate that: 1199 - 1157 = 42 years old. So Richard\
      \ I was 42 when he died.\n\nNow moving on to Agatha Christie. She's a famous\
      \ author, known for her detective novels. She lived much more recently. She\
      \ was born in 1890 and died in 1976, if I remember correctly. Let's verify that.\
      \ Yes, Agatha Christie's dates are 15 September 1890 \u2013 12 January 1976.\
      \ So her age at death would be 1976 minus 1890. That's 86 years old. However,\
      \ since her birthday is in September and she died in January, she was 85 years\
      \ old when she died, because she hadn't reached her 86th birthday yet. Wait,\
      \ let's check that calculation again. From 1890 to 1976 is 86 years, but since\
      \ she died in January 1976, she was 85 years and about 4 months old. So her\
      \ exact age would be 85 years old. Wait, but sometimes people just calculate\
      \ the difference in years. Hmm, maybe I should just subtract the years first:\
      \ 1976 - 1890 = 86. But considering the exact dates, she was born September\
      \ 15, 1890, and died January 12, 1976. So from September 15, 1890, to September\
      \ 15, 1975, would be her 85th birthday. Then she died in January 1976, which\
      \ is 4 months after her 85th birthday, so she was 85 years old. So 85 years\
      \ old at death.\n\nSo Richard I died at 42, Agatha Christie at 85. Therefore,\
      \ yes, Richard I was younger at the time of his death than Agatha Christie was\
      \ at hers.\n\nWait, let me double-check the birth and death years. Richard I:\
      \ born 1157, died 1199. 1199 - 1157 = 42. Correct. Agatha Christie: born 1890,\
      \ died 1976. If you subtract 1976 - 1890, that's 86, but since her death was\
      \ in January before her September birthday, she was 85. So the answer should\
      \ be YES, Richard was younger.\n</think>Richard I, also known as Richard the\
      \ Lionheart, was born in 1157 and died in 1199, making him **42 years old**\
      \ at the time of his death. Agatha Christie, the renowned author, was born in\
      \ 1890 and died in 1976. Though subtracting 1890 from 1976 gives 86, her exact\
      \ age at death was **85 years** (since she died in January 1976, before her\
      \ September birthday). \n\n**YES**, Richard I was younger at his death than\
      \ Agatha Christie at hers."
    affb82bd-b23d-4a91-9d69-deaec7786267: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The question is whether Richard I was younger at the time of\
      \ his death than Agatha Christie when she died. First, I need to figure out\
      \ the birth and death years for both individuals and then calculate their ages\
      \ at death.\n\nStarting with Richard I. If I remember correctly, Richard I of\
      \ England, also known as Richard the Lionheart, was a king during the 12th century.\
      \ Let me recall his dates. I think he was born in 1157. His death... wasn't\
      \ he killed in a battle? Maybe during a siege? I believe he died in 1199. So,\
      \ if he was born in 1157 and died in 1199, subtracting those gives his age.\
      \ 1199 minus 1157 is 42 years old. Wait, but maybe I should verify that. Some\
      \ sources might have different information, but I'm pretty confident about those\
      \ dates.\n\nNow, Agatha Christie. She was a famous author, known for her mystery\
      \ novels. She lived much more recently. I think she was born in 1890 and died\
      \ in 1976. Let me check that mentally. Yes, she was born on September 15, 1890,\
      \ and died on January 12, 1976. So her age at death would be 1976 minus 1890.\
      \ That's 86 years old. But wait, since her birthday is in September and she\
      \ died in January, she would have been 85 years old at the time of death, right?\
      \ Because from September 15, 1890, to September 15, 1975, she turns 85. Then\
      \ she died in January 1976, which is 4 months after her 85th birthday. So she\
      \ was 85 years and about 4 months old. But in terms of years, it's 85 years\
      \ old. Hmm, maybe I should double-check that calculation. 1976 minus 1890 equals\
      \ 86, but because she hadn't reached her birthday in 1976 yet (since she died\
      \ in January), she was 85. So yes, 85 years old.\n\nSo putting it all together:\

    b3485b01-f087-4448-99b7-fb0d7c7644d4: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Richard I was younger when he died than Agatha Christie when she died.\
      \ Hmm. I need to figure out both of their ages at death and compare them.\n\n\
      First, I should recall who these people are. Richard I is probably Richard the\
      \ Lionheart, the King of England, right? He was a famous crusader king in the\
      \ 12th century. Agatha Christie is the well-known mystery writer from the 20th\
      \ century. \n\nSo, first step: Find their birth and death years. \n\nStarting\
      \ with Richard I. From what I remember, he was born in 1157. His death... I\
      \ think he died in 1199. Let me confirm. He was involved in the Third Crusade,\
      \ and he died after being shot with a crossbow bolt during a siege in France.\
      \ Yeah, that was in 1199. So, if he was born in 1157 and died in 1199, his age\
      \ at death would be 1199 minus 1157. Let me calculate that: 1199 - 1157 = 42.\
      \ So Richard I was 42 when he died.\n\nNow, Agatha Christie. She was a 20th-century\
      \ author. I think she lived a long life. Her birth year might be 1890 and death\
      \ in 1976. Let me check that. Yes, she was born on September 15, 1890, and died\
      \ on January 12, 1976. So her age at death would be 1976 - 1890. That's 86 years.\
      \ But wait, she was born in September 1890 and died in January 1976. So that's\
      \ actually 85 years and a few months. But since we're just looking at the year\
      \ difference, subtracting 1890 from 1976 gives 86, but since she died before\
      \ her birthday in 1976, she was 85 years old. Hmm, depending on how precise\
      \ we need to be. But generally, if the question is just based on the years,\
      \ it's 86 minus 1, so 85. Wait, maybe I should check exact dates. Let me think:\
      \ September 15, 1890, to January 12, 1976. From September 15, 1975, to January\
      \ 12, 1976, she would have been 85 years old. So she was 85 years and about\
      \ 4 months old when she died. So her age at death is 85 years.\n\nSo comparing\
      \ the two: Richard I was 42, Agatha Christie was 85. Therefore, Richard I was\
      \ indeed younger at the time of his death than Agatha Christie. So the answer\
      \ should be YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Richard\

      \ 1199  \n   - Age at death: \\(1199 - 1157 = 42\\) years (confirmed as he was\
      \ 41 years and 7 months old).  \n\n2. **Agatha Christie:**  \n   - Born: September\

      \ years old**.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Richard I died at 42, while Agatha Christie\
      \ died at 85. **YES**, Richard I was younger at his death."

      \ been 85 years old at death, right? Because she hadn't reached her 86th birthday\

      \ she died in January, she was 85 years and a few months old. So her age at\
      \ death was 85.\n\nWait, but sometimes people might count it as 86 if they just\
      \ subtract the years without considering the exact months. But the correct way\

      \ = 86, but since she died in January 1976, which is before her September birthday,\
      \ she was 85. So 85 years old.\n\nSo Richard I was 42, Agatha Christie was 85.\
      \ Therefore, Richard I was younger at the time of his death than Agatha Christie.\

      \ Let me confirm that. Yes, Richard I was born September 8, 1157, and died April\

      \nNow Agatha Christie. She was born September 15, 1890, and died January 12,\

      \ the months. She was born in September 1890, died in January 1976. So from\
      \ September 15, 1890, to September 15, 1975, she would have been 85. Then from\

    f3c296fc-589f-4042-b847-8acf689e6ef9: '<think>Okay, let''s figure out whether
      Richard I was younger when he died compared to Agatha Christie. First, I need
      to find out the birth and death years for both of them, then calculate their
      ages at death.


      Starting with Richard I, also known as Richard the Lionheart. I remember he
      was a King of England in the 12th century. Let me recall... He was part of the
      Plantagenet dynasty. I think he was born in 1157. His death was during a siege,
      maybe in France. From what I remember, he died in 1199. So if he was born in
      1157 and died in 1199, his age would be 1199 minus 1157. Let me do the math:
      1199 - 1157 = 42. So Richard I was 42 when he died.


      Now, Agatha Christie. She''s a famous author known for mystery novels. She lived
      in the 20th century. I believe she was born in 1890. Her death year... I think
      she died in 1976. Let me confirm that. Yes, she was born on September 15, 1890,
      and died on January 12, 1976. To calculate her age: 1976 - 1890 = 86 years.
      But wait, she died in January, so if her birthday was in September, she would
      have been 85 years old at the time of her death, because she hadn''t reached
      her 86th birthday yet. Wait, no, 1976 minus 1890 is 86, but since she died in
      January before her September birthday, she was actually 85 years old. Let me
      double-check that. If she was born in September 1890, then in January 1976,
      she had already had her birthday in 1975? Wait, no. Wait, from September 15,
      1890, to September 15, 1975, would be 85 years. Then from September 15, 1975,
      to January 12, 1976, she would be 85 years and about four months. So her age
      at death would be 85 years old, because she hadn''t turned 86 yet. Therefore,
      85 years old when she died.


      So Richard I died at 42, Agatha Christie at 85. Comparing the two, 42 is younger
      than 85. Therefore, yes, Richard I was younger at his time of death than Agatha
      Christie.

      </think>Richard I (the Lionheart) was born in 1157 and died in 1199, making
      him 42 at death. Agatha Christie, born in 1890, died in 1976 at age 85 (having
      not yet reached her 86th birthday). Since 42 < 85, the answer is:


      YES'

      \ Hitler was younger when he died than Dal\xED was when he died. Hmm, first\
      \ I need to remember their birth years and death years. Let's start with Hitler.\
      \ I know he was born in 1889 and died in 1945. So to find his age at death,\
      \ I subtract 1889 from 1945. That would be 1945 - 1889. Let me calculate that:\
      \ 1945 minus 1889... 1945 - 1880 is 65, then subtract 9 more gives 56. So Hitler\
      \ was 56 when he died.\n\nNow, Salvador Dal\xED. His death date is a bit fuzzy\
      \ for me. I think he lived a long life. He was a surrealist artist, right? I\
      \ remember he died in the late 80s or maybe 90s. Let me check my memory. Dal\xED\
      \ was born in 1904. Wait, 1904? So he's younger than Hitler, who was born in\
      \ 1889. But when did he die? I think he lived until like 1989. So 1989 - 1904\
      \ would be 85 years old. So Dal\xED was 85 when he died.\n\nWait, Hitler died\
      \ at 56, Dal\xED at 85. So yes, Hitler was younger when he died compared to\
      \ Dal\xED. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check\
      \ the dates to make sure I didn't mix anything up. Hitler: 20 April 1889 \u2013\
      \ 30 April 1945. Yes, that's correct. 56 years old. Dal\xED: born 11 May 1904,\
      \ died 23 January 1989. So 1989 - 1904 = 85, and since his birthday was in May,\
      \ even subtracting the months, he was 84 or 85. From May 1904 to May 1989 is\
      \ exactly 85 years, but he died in January, so 84 years and 8 months. Wait,\
      \ but in terms of age, once you pass your birthday, you add a year. Since he\
      \ died in January 1989, his last birthday was May 1988. So by January 1989,\
      \ he was 84 years and 8 months. So depending on how you count, but typically,\
      \ the age is calculated as the number of years lived. So he would have been\
      \ 84 years old at death? Wait, no. Wait, if he was born in 1904, from 1904 to\
      \ 1989 is 85 years, but since he hadn't reached his birthday in 1989 (since\
      \ he died in January), he was 84 years old. But sometimes people might say he\
      \ was 85? Hmm, maybe I need to check exact calculation.\n\nLet's do the exact\
      \ math. Dal\xED was born on May 11, 1904. He died on January 23, 1989. So from\
      \ May 11, 1904, to May 11, 1988, he was 84 years old. Then from May 11, 1988,\
      \ to January 23, 1989, that's 8 months and 12 days. So he was 84 years old plus\
      \ that time, so he hadn't turned 85 yet. Therefore, his age at death was 84\
      \ years. Wait, but some sources might round up or use the calculation of subtracting\
      \ the birth year from death year, which would give 85. But strictly speaking,\
      \ since he hadn't had his birthday in 1989, he was 84. But maybe commonly reported\
      \ age is 85? Let me think. For example, if someone is born July 15, 2000, and\
      \ dies in January 2001, they are 0 years old. Then each year after that, until\
      \ July. So in January 2005, they would be 4 years old. So no, the age is counted\
      \ based on completed years. Therefore, Dal\xED was 84 years old at the time\
      \ of his death. But I need to confirm this because sources might differ.\n\n\
      Wait, actually, checking online (if I could), Salvador Dal\xED's death date\
      \ is January 23, 1989. Born May 11, 1904. So calculating his age: 1989 - 1904\
      \ = 85, but since he died before his birthday in 1989, he was 84 years, 8 months,\
      \ and 12 days old. Therefore, his age at death was 84. So if Hitler was 56 and\
      \ Dal\xED 84, then yes, Hitler was younger. But sometimes, people might refer\
      \ to the age as 85 because 1989-1904=85. But if the calculation is precise,\
      \ it's 84. However, in many cases, especially when the exact months aren't considered,\
      \ the age is calculated by subtracting the birth year from the death year. So\
      \ even if you haven't had your birthday yet that year, it's still counted as\
      \ a year. For example, if someone is born in December 2000 and dies in January\
      \ 2001, some sources will say they were 1 year old, even though they only lived\
      \ a month. Wait, no, that's not correct. Age is counted by completed years.\
      \ So in that example, the person would be 0 years old. However, some people\
      \ might incorrectly report it as 1 year. Hmm.\n\nThis is a potential confusion.\
      \ For the purpose of this question, the answer depends on whether we calculate\
      \ exact age or just subtract the years. But since the question is precise (\"\

      \ was 84 years old. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's\
      \ do it step by step.\n\nFrom May 11, 1904, to May 11, 1988: exactly 84 years.\
      \ Then from May 11, 1988, to January 23, 1989: that's 8 months and 12 days.\
      \ Therefore, his age is 84 years, 8 months, and 12 days. So his exact age is\
      \ 84.7 years, approximately. So he was 84 years old when he died, not 85. Therefore,\
      \ Hitler was 56, Dal\xED was 84. So the answer is yes, Hitler was younger at\
      \ death than Dal\xED. But wait, if Dal\xED was 84 and Hitler 56, then yes. But\
      \ maybe I messed up the initial calculation. Let me check again. 1904 to 1989\
      \ is 85 years difference, but age is calculated as death year minus birth year\
      \ only if the birthday has occurred in the death year. Since Dal\xED's birthday\
      \ was in May and he died in January, he hadn't had his 85th birthday yet. Therefore,\
      \ his age at death was 84.\n\nTherefore, Hitler died at 56, Dal\xED at 84. So\
      \ YES, Hitler was younger when he died than Dal\xED.\n</think>Adolf Hitler was\
      \ born on April 20, 1889, and died on April 30, 1945, making him 56 years old\
      \ at the time of his death. Salvador Dal\xED was born on May 11, 1904, and died\
      \ on January 23, 1989. Although subtracting 1904 from 1989 gives 85, Dal\xED\
      \ had not yet reached his 85th birthday (which would have been in May 1989)\
      \ when he died in January. Thus, his precise age at death was 84 years. Since\
      \ 56 (Hitler) is younger than 84 (Dal\xED), the answer is **YES**."
    17cee200-211b-4a1e-b3c1-7a468d9a8d22: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The question is whether Adolf Hitler was younger at the time\
      \ of his death than Salvador Dal\xED when he died. So, I need to find out the\
      \ birth years and death years of both men, calculate their ages at death, and\
      \ then compare them.\n\nFirst, I'll start with Adolf Hitler. From what I remember,\
      \ Hitler was born in 1889. He died in 1945, right? Because he committed suicide\
      \ at the end of World War II. Let me confirm that: yes, Hitler was born on April\
      \ 20, 1889, and he died on April 30, 1945. So to calculate his age at death,\
      \ subtract 1889 from 1945. That would be 1945 minus 1889. Let me do the math:\
      \ 1945 - 1889 = 56. Wait, but wait. His birthday is in April and his death was\
      \ also in April. Since he died on April 30, which is after his birthday on April\
      \ 20, he had already turned 56 that year. So Hitler was 56 years old when he\
      \ died.\n\nNow, Salvador Dal\xED. I think he lived a longer life. I'm pretty\
      \ sure he was born in the early 20th century. Let me recall. I believe Dal\xED\
      \ was born in 1904. His death year... wasn't he alive until the 1980s? Yes,\
      \ I think he died in 1989. Let me check: born May 11, 1904, and died January\
      \ 23, 1989. So, to find his age at death, subtract 1904 from 1989. 1989 minus\
      \ 1904 is 85. But wait, his birthday is in May and he died in January. So in\
      \ 1989, he hadn't yet reached his 85th birthday. So he was 84 years old when\
      \ he died, turning 85 later that year. So Dal\xED died at age 84 (or 85? Let\
      \ me be precise). From January 23, 1989 to May 11, 1989, he would have been\
      \ 84 until May 11, when he would turn 85. Since he died in January, he was 84\
      \ years old at death. Wait, no. Wait, if someone is born in 1904, their age\
      \ in 1989 would be 1989 - 1904 = 85, but if they died before their birthday,\
      \ subtract one. Let's compute the exact age: from May 11, 1904, to January 23,\
      \ 1989. That's 84 years and 8 months and 12 days, approximately. So he was 84\
      \ years old, not yet 85. Therefore, his age at death was 84.\n\nWait, now I'm\
      \ confused. Wait, 1989 minus 1904 is 85. But if he died before his birthday\
      \ in 1989, then he was 84. Let me verify that. For example, if someone was born\
      \ in 2000 and dies in 2024 before their birthday, they're 23. So yeah, 2024-2000=24,\
      \ but subtract 1 if the birthday hasn't occurred. So Dal\xED was 84 when he\
      \ died. Therefore, Hitler was 56 and Dal\xED was 84. Comparing the two, 56 is\
      \ younger than 84. Therefore, YES, Hitler was younger at the time of his death\
      \ than Dal\xED was at his death.\n</think>Adolf Hitler was born in 1889 and\

    63ed95c1-8ef6-4bb5-b611-c1f55a882bc3: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure this out.\

      \ 85 years. Wait, his birthday is in May, so if he died in January 1989, he\
      \ would still be 84 until May. But I think he died in January 23, 1989. So from\
      \ May 11, 1904 to January 23, 1989, that's 84 years and 8 months or so. But\

      \ need to know the birth and death years of both individuals. Let's start with\
      \ Adolf Hitler. From what I remember, Hitler was born in 1889. He died in 1945\
      \ when he committed suicide in his bunker towards the end of World War II. So,\
      \ to calculate his age at death, I subtract his birth year from his death year:\
      \ 1945 minus 1889. That would be 56 years old. Wait, let me check that math\
      \ again. 1889 plus 56 is 1945, yes, so he was 56 when he died.\n\nNow, Salvador\
      \ Dal\xED. He was a famous surrealist painter. I think he lived a long life.\
      \ Let me recall his birth year. I believe he was born in 1904. As for his death,\
      \ he passed away in the late 20th century. I think it was 1989. So, his age\
      \ at death would be 1989 minus 1904. Let's do that subtraction: 1989 minus 1904.\
      \ Hmm, 1904 plus 85 is 1989, so he was 85 years old when he died.\n\nComparing\
      \ the two: Hitler died at 56, Dal\xED at 85. So, yes, Hitler was younger at\
      \ the time of his death than Dal\xED was when he died. Therefore, the answer\
      \ should be YES.\n\nWait, just to make sure my dates are correct. Let me verify.\
      \ Hitler's birth date is April 20, 1889, and he died on April 30, 1945. So exactly\
      \ 56 years and 10 days old. Dal\xED was born on May 11, 1904, and died on January\
      \ 23, 1989. So calculating his age: from 1904 to 1989 is 85 years, but since\
      \ he died in January and was born in May, he was 84 years and 8 months old.\
      \ Wait, does that affect the calculation? If we're going by years of age, regardless\
      \ of the exact months, then 1989 minus 1904 is 85. But if the death occurred\
      \ before his birthday in 1989, he would be 84. Let me check the exact date.\
      \ Dal\xED died on January 23, 1989. His birth date is May 11, 1904. So from\
      \ May 11, 1904, to January 23, 1989, that's 84 years, 8 months, and 12 days.\
      \ Therefore, he was 84 years old at the time of death, not 85. Oh, that changes\
      \ things. So I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's clarify. If you\
      \ subtract 1904 from 1989, you get 85, but since he hadn't reached his 85th\
      \ birthday yet in 1989 (since he died in January and his birthday was in May),\
      \ his actual age was 84. So the correct age would be 84. That means my initial\
      \ calculation was wrong. So Hitler was 56, Dal\xED was 84. Then the answer is\
      \ still YES, because 56 is less than 84. But let me confirm the exact age of\
      \ Dal\xED again.\n\nAnother way: if he was born in 1904, in 1988 he would have\
      \ been 84 (1904 +84=1988). He died in 1989, so 1988 +1 = 1989, so he turned\
      \ 85 only if he lived past May 11, 1989. But he died in January 1989, so he\
      \ was still 84. Therefore, his age at death is 84. Hmm, but sometimes people\
      \ might count the years as just subtracting the birth year from the death year\
      \ without considering the exact date. So depending on that, there's a potential\
      \ discrepancy. But I think the accurate way is to count the actual age based\
      \ on the dates. So Dal\xED was 84, Hitler was 56. So the answer remains YES,\
      \ Hitler was younger at death than Dal\xED. Wait, but if the question is phrased\
      \ as \"younger at their time of death than Salvador Dal\xED at their time of\
      \ death,\" then comparing Hitler's age at death (56) to Dal\xED's age at death\
      \ (84), so 56 < 84, so YES. The initial mistake was thinking Dal\xED was 85,\
      \ but even corrected to 84, the answer is still the same.\n\nSo, conclusion:\
      \ YES, Hitler was younger when he died compared to Dal\xED.\n</think>Adolf Hitler\

    bba3bfe1-b275-4d0a-b440-46ee12a591fe: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. So, the question is: Was Adolf Hitler younger at his time of\

      \ need to figure out the birth and death years of both individuals. Let's start\
      \ with Adolf Hitler. From what I remember, Hitler was born in 1889. He died\
      \ in 1945, right? Because he committed suicide at the end of World War II. Now,\
      \ Salvador Dal\xED\u2014the famous surrealist painter. I think he lived a long\
      \ life. He was born in 1904, if I'm not mistaken, and died much later. Maybe\
      \ in the 1980s? Let me confirm that.\n\nSo, Hitler's lifespan: 1889 to 1945.\
      \ That would make him 56 years old when he died. Because 1945 minus 1889 equals\
      \ 56. Let me double-check: 1889 + 56 = 1945. Yep, that adds up.\n\nNow, Salvador\
      \ Dal\xED. Born in 1904, died in... I want to say 1989? Wait, no, I think he\
      \ died in the late '80s, but maybe 1989. Let me make sure. Oh, wait, actually,\
      \ I recall he died in 1989. So, if he was born in 1904 and died in 1989, that\
      \ would make him 85 years old. 1989 minus 1904 is 85. Let me calculate that\
      \ again: 1904 + 85 = 1989. Correct.\n\nSo, Hitler was 56 when he died, and Dal\xED\
      \ was 85. Therefore, Hitler was indeed younger at the time of his death than\
      \ Dal\xED was when he died. So the answer should be YES.\n\nWait, but did I\
      \ get Dal\xED's death year right? Sometimes dates can be tricky. Let me verify\

      \n**ANSWER: YES**"
    d3914e9b-2664-4ea1-938b-85f9e43f36d1: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure this\
      \ out. The question is whether Adolf Hitler was younger at the time of his death\
      \ than Salvador Dal\xED was when he died. I need to compare their ages at death.\n\
      \nFirst, I should find out when each of them was born and when they died. Let's\
      \ start with Hitler. I remember he died in 1945, right? He was in power during\
      \ World War II and committed suicide in the bunker when the war was ending.\
      \ His birth year... I think he was born in 1889. So if he died in 1945, his\
      \ age would be 1945 minus 1889. Let me calculate that: 1945 - 1889 = 56 years\
      \ old. So Hitler was 56 when he died.\n\nNow, Salvador Dal\xED. He was a famous\
      \ Spanish artist, known for his surrealist work. I think he lived a long life.\
      \ When did he die? I'm not exactly sure, but I believe it was in the 1980s.\
      \ Maybe 1989? Wait, no, that might be too late. Let me recall. I think he was\
      \ born in 1904. If he died in 1989, that would make him 85, but I'm not certain.\
      \ Wait, actually, I remember that Dal\xED died in 1989, yes. So if he was born\
      \ in 1904, subtracting 1904 from 1989 gives 85. So he was 85 when he died.\n\
      \nSo Hitler died at 56, Dal\xED at 85. Therefore, Hitler was indeed younger\
      \ when he died than Dal\xED. The answer should be YES. Wait, let me double-check\
      \ the dates to be sure. Hitler: born April 20, 1889, died April 30, 1945. So\
      \ that's 56 years and 10 days old. Dal\xED: born May 11, 1904, died January\
      \ 23, 1989. Let's check that. 1989 minus 1904 is 85 years, but he died in January,\
      \ so he hadn't had his birthday yet in 1989. So from May 11, 1904 to January\
      \ 23, 1989, that's 84 years and 8 months approximately. Wait, but in terms of\
      \ age, you count the years completed. So if he was born in 1904, in 1989 he\
      \ would be 85 minus the months before his birthday. Since he died in January,\
      \ his last birthday would have been May 11, 1988. So from May 11, 1988 to January\
      \ 23, 1989, he was 84 years old until May 1988, then 85 after that. Wait, no,\
      \ age is calculated as each birthday adds a year. So if he was born in 1904,\
      \ in 1988 he turned 84 (1988-1904=84). Then on May 11, 1989, he would have turned\
      \ 85. But he died in January 1989, so he was 84 years old at the time of death.\
      \ Wait, that can't be right. Let me recalculate. If he was born on May 11, 1904,\
      \ then from 1904 to 1989 is 85 years. But if he died in January 1989, he didn't\
      \ reach his 85th birthday. So his age would be 84 years, 8 months, and some\
      \ days. But usually, when stating age at death, it's the number of completed\
      \ years. So Dal\xED was 84 when he died? That conflicts with my initial thought.\
      \ Hmm. Let me check a reliable source mentally. Wait, I might be mixing up dates.\
      \ Maybe Dal\xED died in 1989 but was born in 1904, so 1989 minus 1904 is 85.\
      \ But if his birthday is after January, then he was 84. Let me confirm. Dal\xED\
      's exact date of death is January 23, 1989. His birthday is May 11. So as of\
      \ January 23, 1989, he had not yet turned 85. Therefore, his age at death would\
      \ be 84 years. Wait, but some sources might list his age as 85 if they count\
      \ the year of death even if the birthday hadn't occurred. This is a common confusion.\
      \ For example, if someone is born in 2000 and dies in 2020 before their birthday,\
      \ their age is 19, but sometimes people might mistakenly say 20. To be precise,\
      \ it's 19. So Dal\xED's correct age would be 84. But I need to check. Wait,\
      \ let me think. If he was born in 1904, then in 1988, he turned 84. In 1989,\
      \ he would turn 85 on May 11. Since he died in January 1989, he was 84 years\
      \ old. But I've seen sources say he was 84 when he died. So if that's the case,\
      \ then Hitler was 56, Dal\xED 84. So Hitler was younger. The answer is YES.\
      \ But wait, some sources might say Dal\xED was 85. I need to resolve this. Alternatively,\
      \ maybe I got Dal\xED's death year wrong. Let me check. No, I'm pretty sure\
      \ Dal\xED died in 1989. So 1989-1904=85, but since he died before his birthday,\
      \ it's 84. Therefore, 84. So Hitler was 56, Dal\xED 84. So yes, Hitler was younger.\
      \ Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\
      \  \n1. **Adolf Hitler** was born on April 20, 1889, and died on April 30, 1945.\
      \  \n   - Age at death: 1945 - 1889 = **56 years** (died 10 days after his 56th\

      \ on January 23, 1989.  \n   - Calculation: 1989 - 1904 = 85 years, but he died\
      \ **before** his May 11 birthday in 1989.  \n   - Completed age: **84 years**\
      \ (8 months and 12 days short of 85).  \n\n3. **Comparison**: Hitler (56) died\
      \ younger than Dal\xED (84).  \n\n**Answer**: YES"
    ddafc1c3-8cdc-471a-a3a3-3226f4a5aa4d: "<think>Alright, let me try to figure this\
      \ out. The question is whether Adolf Hitler was younger when he died compared\
      \ to Salvador Dal\xED when he died. Okay, so first, I need to find out the birth\
      \ and death dates of both people, then calculate their ages at the time of death,\
      \ and then compare those ages.\n\nStarting with Adolf Hitler. I know he died\
      \ in 1945 because he committed suicide at the end of World War II. His birth\
      \ year... I think he was born in 1889. Let me confirm that. Yes, Hitler was\
      \ born on April 20, 1889. He died on April 30, 1945. So, to calculate his age:\
      \ 1945 minus 1889. That would make him 56 years old when he died. Wait, but\
      \ let me check the exact dates. He was born in April and died in April, so his\
      \ birthday had just passed. So 1945 - 1889 = 56 years. So he was 56.\n\nNow\
      \ Salvador Dal\xED. He's the famous surrealist painter. I think he lived a long\
      \ life. I remember he died in the 1980s or so. Let me check. Dali was born on\
      \ May 11, 1904. His death date... I think it's 1989? Wait, no. Let me think\
      \ again. Maybe 23 January 1989? So if he was born in 1904 and died in 1989,\
      \ that's 85 years. Wait, 1989 minus 1904 is 85. So he would have been 84 or\
      \ 85, depending on the exact birth and death dates. Since he was born in May\
      \ and died in January, he hadn't turned 85 yet. So he was 84 years old when\
      \ he died.\n\nSo Hitler died at 56, Dal\xED at 84. Therefore, Hitler was younger\
      \ when he died compared to Dal\xED. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES\
      \  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Adolf Hitler's Dates:** Born April\

      \ 23, 1989.  \n   - Age at death: 1989 \u2212 1904 = **84 years** (since he\
      \ died before his May birthday, he was **84**).  \n\n3. **Comparison:** 56 (Hitler)\
      \ < 84 (Dal\xED).  \n\n**Answer:** YES, Hitler was younger at his death than\

      \ 1971 is 24 years. But I need to check the exact dates. Oh, right, her birthday\
      \ was April 16, 1971, and she died on March 31, 1995. So she was just a few\
      \ weeks short of her 24th birthday. So she was 23 years old when she died.\n\
      \nNow, Maya Angelou. She was a renowned poet and author. I know she lived a\

    036c9440-8a13-43a1-93a3-78f71cd914b2: '<think>Okay, let''s try to figure this
      out. The question is whether Yuri Gagarin was younger when he died than T.S.
      Eliot was when he died. So, I need to find out both of their ages at the time
      of their deaths and compare them.


      First, I should recall who these people are. Yuri Gagarin was the first human
      to go into space, right? He was a Soviet cosmonaut. T.S. Eliot was a poet, I
      think, from the 20th century. Now, I need their birth and death years.


      Starting with Yuri Gagarin. I believe he was born in 1934. Let me check... Yes,
      Gagarin was born on March 9, 1934. He died in a plane crash, if I remember correctly.
      When was that? I think it was in 1968. So he was 34 years old when he died.
      Let me confirm: 1968 minus 1934 is 34. So 34 years old at death.


      Now T.S. Eliot. He was an American-British poet, known for works like "The Waste
      Land." His birth year... I think he was born in 1888. Let me see. Yes, T.S.
      Eliot was born on September 26, 1888. When did he die? He died in 1965. So 1965
      minus 1888. Let me calculate that. 1965 minus 1888 is 77 years. Wait, 1888 plus
      77 would be 1965, so that''s correct. So Eliot was 76 when he died? Wait, wait.
      Wait, 1965 - 1888: 1888 + 77 = 1965. So he was 76 years old when he died. Wait,
      but sometimes the calculation can be tricky if the birthday hasn''t occurred
      yet in the death year. Let me check his death date. Eliot died on January 4,
      1965. His birthday is in September, so in 1965 he hadn''t turned 77 yet. So
      from September 1888 to January 1965, he would have been 76 years and a few months
      old. So 76 years old at death.


      Wait, wait. Wait, let''s do the exact math. If he was born in September 1888
      and died in January 1965, that''s 76 years and about 3 months. So he was 76
      years old when he died. So his age at death was 76.


      So Gagarin was 34, Eliot was 76. Therefore, Gagarin was younger at the time
      of his death than Eliot was. So the answer should be YES.

      </think>Yuri Gagarin was born in 1934 and died in 1968 at age 34. T. S. Eliot
      was born in 1888 and died in 1965 at age 76. Since 34 is younger than 76, the
      answer is YES.


      **Answer:** YES'
    4e264299-3a57-4c2b-b1b3-c4d46f272a33: '<think>Alright, let''s tackle this question.
      So, the question is whether Yuri Gagarin was younger at the time of his death
      than T.S. Eliot was when he died. Hmm, okay. I need to figure out their birth
      and death dates and then calculate their ages at death to compare.


      First, I should recall who these people are. Yuri Gagarin was the first human
      to journey into outer space, right? He was a Soviet cosmonaut. T.S. Eliot, on
      the other hand, was a poet, known for works like "The Waste Land." I think he
      was American but later became a British citizen. But maybe the exact details
      aren''t critical here; more important are their lifespans.


      Okay, let''s start with Yuri Gagarin. From what I remember, he died in a plane
      crash. I think he was relatively young. Maybe in his 30s? Let me check the dates.
      Wait, I need to recall without looking it up. He was born in 1934, maybe? And
      died in 1968. So if he was born in ''34 and died in ''68, that''s 34 years old.
      Wait, 1968 minus 1934 is indeed 34. So Gagarin was 34 when he died.


      Now, T.S. Eliot. He was a 20th-century poet. I know he lived into his 70s, perhaps.
      Let''s see. Born in 1888? And died in 1965. Let me confirm. If he was born in
      1888 and died in 1965, that would make him 77 years old. Wait, because 1965
      minus 1888 is 77. Wait, 1888 plus 77 is 1965, yes. So Eliot was 77 when he died.


      So comparing the two: Gagarin died at 34, Eliot at 77. So yes, Gagarin was younger
      when he died than Eliot. Therefore, the answer should be YES.


      Wait, but I should make sure I didn''t mix up any dates. Let me double-check.
      Gagarin''s birth date is March 9, 1934, and he died on March 27, 1968. That''s
      correct; he was 34. T.S. Eliot was born September 26, 1888, and died January
      4, 1965. So from 1888 to 1965. 1965 minus 1888: let''s calculate that. 1965
      - 1888 = 77 years, but since his birthday is in September and he died in January,
      he hadn''t turned 77 yet in 1965. Wait, wait. If he was born in 1888, then in
      1965 he would be 1965 - 1888 = 77, but since he died in January, before his
      birthday in September, he was actually 76 years old. Oh, that''s a detail I
      might have missed. So his age at death would be 76, not 77. Let me check that
      again. If someone is born in September 1888, then in January 1965, they have
      not yet had their birthday in 1965. So the calculation would be 1964 - 1888
      = 76 years. Because from September 1888 to September 1964 is 76 years, and then
      from September 1964 to January 1965 is a few months. So Eliot was 76 when he
      died. Does that change the answer? Well, even if Eliot was 76, Gagarin was 34.
      So 34 is still younger than 76. So the answer remains YES.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.

      </think>YES. Yuri Gagarin was born on March 9, 1934, and died on March 27, 1968,
      making him 34 years old at his death. T.S. Eliot was born on September 26, 1888,
      and died on January 4, 1965. Calculating Eliot''s age: 1965 - 1888 = 77 years,
      but since he died in January before his September birthday, he was 76 years
      old at death. Since 34 (Gagarin) is younger than 76 (Eliot), the answer is **YES**.'

      \ So he was 76 years old when he died? Wait, no. Let me do the math properly.\
      \ \n\nIf he was born in 1888, then in 1965, he would be 1965 - 1888 = 77. But\
      \ since he died in January 1965, and his birthday is in September, he hadn't\
      \ had his 77th birthday yet. So he was 76 years old at death. Wait, that's a\

      \ September 26, 1964, to January 4, 1965, he's 76 years and a few months. So\
      \ he died at age 76, not 77. \n\nOh, so maybe I was wrong earlier. So Eliot\

      \ Yuri Gagarin was younger at his time of death than T.S. Eliot was when he\
      \ died. I need to compare their ages at death. \n\nFirst, let me recall when\
      \ each of them was born and when they died. \n\nStarting with Yuri Gagarin.\
      \ I remember he was the first human in space, which was in 1961. I think he\
      \ died in a plane crash, but I'm not exactly sure of the year. Maybe the late\
      \ 60s? Let me check that. Oh right, he died in 1968. His birth year was 1934,\
      \ if I'm correct. So he was born on March 9, 1934, and died on March 27, 1968.\
      \ Let me calculate his age. 1968 minus 1934 is 34 years. But he died in March,\
      \ and his birthday was also in March. Since he died on the 27th and was born\
      \ on the 9th, he had already turned 34 that year. So Gagarin was 34 years old\
      \ when he died.\n\nNow, T.S. Eliot. He was a poet, right? The author of \"The\
      \ Waste Land.\" I think he lived a longer life. When was he born? Maybe 1888?\
      \ And he died in 1965. Let me confirm that. Yes, T.S. Eliot was born September\
      \ 26, 1888, and died January 4, 1965. To find his age at death: 1965 minus 1888.\
      \ Let's subtract: 1965 - 1888. 1888 + 77 = 1965, so that would make him 77 years\
      \ old. Wait, but he died in January 1965. His birthday is in September, so he\
      \ hadn't turned 77 yet in January. Wait, wait, 1965 minus 1888: 1965 - 1888.\
      \ Let me do the math properly. From 1888 to 1900 is 12 years. Then 1900 to 1965\
      \ is 65 years. So total is 12 + 65 = 77. But he died in January 1965 before\
      \ his September birthday. So he was 76 years old at the time of death. Because\
      \ he was born in September 1888, and died in January 1965. So from September\
      \ 1964 to January 1965, he was 76. Therefore, he was 76 when he died.\n\nWait,\
      \ let me recalculate. If he was born in 1888, then in 1964, he would turn 76\
      \ (1964 - 1888 = 76). But he died in January 1965, so he was 76 years and a\
      \ few months old. Therefore, his age at death was 76. So T.S. Eliot was 76 when\
      \ he died. \n\nWait, but sometimes people might count the years as 1965-1888=77,\
      \ but since his birthday hadn't occurred yet in 1965, he was still 76. So that's\
      \ correct.\n\nSo Gagarin was 34, Eliot was 76. Therefore, Gagarin was younger\
      \ at his death than Eliot. So the answer is YES.\n</think>Yuri Gagarin was born\
      \ on March 9, 1934, and died on March 27, 1968, making him **34 years old**\
      \ at his death. T.S. Eliot was born on September 26, 1888, and died on January\
      \ 4, 1965. Since he died in January 1965 before his September birthday, he was\
      \ **76 years old** at his death. \n\nGagarin (34) was younger than Eliot (76)\
      \ at the time of their deaths. \n\n**YES**"

      \ and died in 1965. Wait, 1965? So if he was born in 1888, that would make him\
      \ 77 years old when he died. Let me confirm. T.S. Eliot's birth date is September\
      \ 26, 1888, and he died on January 4, 1965. So calculating his age: 1965 minus\
      \ 1888 is 77. But since his birthday is in September and he died in January,\
      \ he hadn't turned 77 yet in 1965. Wait, wait, 1965 minus 1888 is 77, but he\
      \ died in January 1965, so he was 76 years old, because he was born in September.\
      \ Let me check that again. From September 26, 1888, to September 26, 1964, he\
      \ would be 76. Then from September 26, 1964, to January 4, 1965, he was 76 years\
      \ and a few months. So when he died on January 4, 1965, he was 76 years old,\
      \ not 77. Wait, that's a common mistake. So 1965 minus 1888 is 77, but because\
      \ his birthday hadn't occurred yet in 1965, he was 76. So his age at death was\
      \ 76 years, 3 months, and some days. Hmm, but sometimes sources might round\
      \ up. Let me verify. According to reliable sources, T.S. Eliot died at the age\

      \ I'll start with Malcolm X. I know he was a prominent figure in the civil rights\
      \ movement. I'm trying to recall when he was born and when he died. From what\
      \ I remember, Malcolm X was assassinated in the mid-1960s. Let me check the\
      \ exact dates. Wait, Malcolm X was born on May 19, 1925. His death was on February\
      \ 21, 1965. So to calculate his age at death, I subtract his birth year from\
      \ his death year: 1965 - 1925 = 40 years. But since his birthday is in May and\
      \ he died in February, he hadn't turned 40 yet. So he was 39 years old when\
      \ he died. Wait, let me confirm that. If he was born in 1925, on May 19, then\
      \ in February 1965, he would have been 39 years old, and would have turned 40\
      \ in May of that year. So yes, he was 39 when he died.\n\nNow, Alexander Hamilton.\
      \ He's one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. I remember that he\
      \ was involved in the American Revolution and was the first Secretary of the\
      \ Treasury. His death is famous because he was killed in a duel with Aaron Burr.\
      \ Let me recall the dates. Hamilton was born on January 11, 1755 or 1757\u2014\
      wait, there's some confusion about his birth year because he was born in the\
      \ Caribbean and records weren't clear. But I think the consensus now is that\
      \ he was born in 1755. He died on July 12, 1804. So calculating his age at death:\
      \ 1804 minus 1755. Let's do that math. 1804 - 1755 = 49 years. But again, check\
      \ the exact dates. He was born on January 11, 1755, and died on July 12, 1804.\
      \ So from January 11, 1755, to January 11, 1804, he would have been 49. Then\
      \ from January 11 to July 12, 1804, that's six months and one day. So he was\
      \ 49 years old when he died. \n\nSo comparing the two: Malcolm X died at 39,\

      \ is 40, but since the death was in February and his birthday in May, he hadn't\
      \ reached 40 yet, so 39. Correct. Hamilton: 1755-1804, which is 49 years. So\

      \ Okay, so the question is: Was Malcolm X younger at their time of death than\

      \ of both when they died and compare them. \n\nFirst, I should recall their\
      \ birth and death years. Let me start with Alexander Hamilton. He's one of the\
      \ Founding Fathers of the United States. I think he was involved in the American\
      \ Revolution, so probably 1700s. I remember he was born in the Caribbean, maybe\
      \ in the 1750s? Let me check my memory. Oh right, Hamilton was born on January\
      \ 11, 1755, and he died on July 12, 1804. Wait, how old does that make him?\
      \ So if he was born in 1755 and died in 1804, subtracting 1755 from 1804 gives\
      \ 49 years. But wait, he died in July, so if his birthday was in January, he\
      \ would have already turned 49 that year. So yeah, Hamilton was 49 when he died.\n\
      \nNow, Malcolm X. He was a prominent figure in the civil rights movement, so\
      \ mid-20th century. I think he was assassinated in the 1960s. His birth name\
      \ was Malcolm Little. Let me recall his dates. I believe he was born in 1925.\
      \ His death was in 1965. So, if he was born in 1925 and died in 1965, that would\
      \ make him 39 or 40 years old. Let's calculate: 1965 minus 1925 is 40. But wait,\
      \ his exact birthday and death date matter. Malcolm X was born on May 19, 1925,\
      \ and he was assassinated on February 21, 1965. So, from May 1925 to February\
      \ 1965, he hadn't yet reached his 40th birthday. So he was 39 years old when\
      \ he died.\n\nSo comparing the two: Hamilton died at 49, Malcolm X at 39. Therefore,\

      \ and died on February 21, 1965. This makes him **39 years old** at death. \
      \ \n\nSince 39 < 49, the answer is **YES**.  \n\nANSWER: YES"
    37235d23-e25b-40f8-83b2-37a39b16871a: '<think>Alright, let''s tackle this question.
      So, the question is whether Malcolm X was younger at the time of his death than
      Alexander Hamilton was when he died. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure out
      both of their ages when they passed away.


      Starting with Malcolm X. I remember he was a prominent figure in the civil rights
      movement. I think he was assassinated in the 1960s. Let me recall his birth
      year. Malcolm X was born in 1925. His death was in 1965. So, subtracting 1925
      from 1965 gives 40 years old. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. Yes,
      Malcolm X was born on May 19, 1925, and died on February 21, 1965. So he was
      39 years old, actually, because his 40th birthday would have been in May 1965,
      but he died in February, so he was 39. Hmm, that''s a common mistake. So 1965
      minus 1925 is 40, but since his birthday hadn''t occurred yet in 1965, he was
      39 years, 9 months old. So, 39 years old at death.


      Now, Alexander Hamilton. He''s one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.
      He was involved in the Revolutionary War and the early government. I know he
      died in a famous duel with Aaron Burr. Let me recall the dates. Hamilton was
      born on January 11, 1755 or 1757? Wait, there''s some confusion about his birth
      year because he was from the Caribbean, and records weren''t clear. But most
      sources say he was born in 1755. He died in 1804. So, 1804 minus 1755 would
      be 49 years old. But wait, let''s check the exact dates. Hamilton was born on
      January 11, 1755, and died on July 12, 1804. So, from January 11, 1755, to January
      11, 1804, that''s 49 years. Then from January 11 to July 12, 1804, that''s an
      additional 6 months. So he was 49 years and about 6 months old when he died.
      So 49 years old.


      So comparing the two: Malcolm X was 39, Hamilton was 49. Therefore, yes, Malcolm
      X was younger at the time of his death than Alexander Hamilton was when he died.
      Wait, but wait, I need to make sure I didn''t mix up the dates. Let me confirm
      again. Malcolm X: 1925-1965, died at 39. Hamilton: 1755-1804, died at 49. So
      39 vs. 49. So the answer is YES, Malcolm X was younger.

      </think>Malcolm X was born in 1925 and died in 1965 at age 39. Alexander Hamilton
      was born in 1755 and died in 1804 at age 49. Since 39 is younger than 49, the
      answer is:


      YES'
    78cdd140-6833-4d34-bfd6-39e1a2b780fd: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, we need to determine if Malcolm X was younger when he died compared to\

      \ Let me recall\u2026 He was born in 1925, right? And he died in 1965. So if\
      \ he was born in 1925 and died in 1965, that would make him 40 years old at\
      \ the time of his death. Wait, let me confirm. If you subtract 1925 from 1965,\
      \ that's 40 years. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nNow, Alexander Hamilton. He's\
      \ one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. I know he died in a famous\
      \ duel with Aaron Burr. When was that? I think it was in 1804. And his birth\
      \ year was... uh, 1755 or 1757? Wait, there's some debate about his exact birth\
      \ year because of different records, but most sources I've heard say 1755. So\
      \ if he was born in 1755 and died in 1804, his age would be 1804 minus 1755.\
      \ Let me calculate that. 1804 minus 1755 is 49 years. So Hamilton would have\
      \ been 49 when he died.\n\nComparing the two, Malcolm X at 40 and Hamilton at\
      \ 49. So Malcolm X was indeed younger when he died. Therefore, the answer should\
      \ be YES. But wait, let me double-check the dates to make sure I didn't mix\
      \ up anything. For Malcolm X, sources do say May 19, 1925, to February 21, 1965,\
      \ so 39 years old (since his birthday is in May and he died in February, so\
      \ he hadn't turned 40 yet). Wait, actually, if he was born in 1925 and died\
      \ in 1965, subtracting gives 40, but since the death date is before his birthday\
      \ in 1965, he was 39. Hmm, that's a crucial point. Let me recalculate: 1965\
      \ minus 1925 is 40, but from May 1925 to February 1965 is 39 years and about\
      \ 9 months. So he was 39 at death. \n\nBut wait, sometimes people count the\
      \ age as the number of completed years. If Malcolm X was born on May 19, 1925,\
      \ and died on February 21, 1965, he would have been 39 years, 9 months, and\
      \ 2 days old. So, not yet 40. So his age at death was 39. \n\nThen Alexander\
      \ Hamilton was born on January 11, 1755 (or 1757? Wait, some sources say he\
      \ was born in 1757, but recent scholarship points to 1755. The confusion comes\
      \ from him claiming 1757 later in life, perhaps to appear younger. But according\
      \ to most historians now, 1755 is correct. So if he was born in 1755 and died\
      \ July 12, 1804, then 1804 minus 1755 is 49. His birthday is in January, and\
      \ he died in July, so he had already turned 49 that year. So he was 49 years\
      \ old. \n\nSo if Malcolm X was 39 and Hamilton 49, then the answer is YES, Malcolm\
      \ X was younger. But I initially thought 40 vs. 49, but the exact dates matter.\
      \ So the correct answer is YES, because 39 is younger than 49.\n</think>To determine\
      \ if Malcolm X was younger at his death than Alexander Hamilton:\n\n- **Malcolm\

      \ was born on January 11, 1755, and died on July 12, 1804. He lived to **49\

      \ government. I know he died in a famous duel with Aaron Burr. If I recall correctly,\
      \ Hamilton was born around 1755 or 1757. Wait, there's some confusion about\
      \ his exact birth year because of records from the Caribbean. Let me confirm:\
      \ Hamilton was born on January 11, 1755 (or 1757, but I think 1755 is more accepted).\
      \ He died on July 12, 1804. So if he was born in 1755, he would be 49 or 47\
      \ years old at death. But the widely accepted age is 47. Hmm, wait, no. If he\
      \ was born in 1755 and died in 1804, that's 1804 minus 1755, which is 49 years.\
      \ But some sources say he was born in 1757, which would make him 47. This is\
      \ a bit conflicting. I need to verify. From what I remember, historical consensus\
      \ now leans towards 1755. But this is a point of confusion. Let me think. Wait,\
      \ his gravestone says 1757, but he himself claimed 1755 in later life. So possibly\
      \ he was older. Assuming 1755, he died at 49. If 1757, then 47. But I think\
      \ the correct answer is 47. However, maybe the question expects the commonly\
      \ cited age. Wait, I should check. For example, Hamilton's duel with Burr was\
      \ in 1804. If born in 1757, 1804 minus 1757 is 47. So if we take 1757 as his\
      \ birth year, he was 47. But if it's 1755, 49. So which is it? I think recent\
      \ scholarship suggests he was born in 1755. But this could be a point of confusion.\
      \ Let me see. According to most biographies, Hamilton was born in 1755 or 1757.\
      \ The exact year is debated. However, his legal documents and his own statements\
      \ suggest 1757. But some records from Nevis indicate 1755. So this is tricky.\

      \ is asking whether Abu Bakr was younger at the time of his death than George\
      \ H. W. Bush when he died. I need to figure out their ages at death and compare\
      \ them.\n\nFirst, I should recall who these people are. Abu Bakr was the first\
      \ caliph of Islam, right? He was a close companion of the Prophet Muhammad and\
      \ became the leader after Muhammad's death. George H. W. Bush was the 41st President\
      \ of the United States, serving from 1989 to 1993, and he died more recently.\n\
      \nNow, let's get their birth and death years. For Abu Bakr, I think he was born\
      \ around 573 CE and died in 634 CE. So to find his age, subtract 573 from 634.\
      \ That would be 634 - 573 = 61 years old. Wait, but I should double-check that.\
      \ Sometimes dates in early Islamic history might be approximate, but I think\
      \ Abu Bakr's lifespan is generally accepted as 573\u2013634 CE, making him 61\
      \ when he died.\n\nNow, George H. W. Bush. He was born on June 12, 1924, and\
      \ died on November 30, 2018. Let's calculate his age. From 1924 to 2018 is 94\
      \ years, but we need to account for the exact months. He was born in June and\
      \ died in November, which is 5 months later. So from June 12, 1924, to June\
      \ 12, 2018, is exactly 94 years. Then from June 12 to November 30 is an additional\
      \ 5 months and 18 days. So he was 94 years and about 5.5 months old when he\
      \ died. So his age at death was 94 years.\n\nComparing the two: Abu Bakr was\

      \ and he died more recently.\n\nNow, I need to find out their birth and death\
      \ years to calculate their ages at death. Let me start with Abu Bakr. From what\
      \ I remember, Abu Bakr lived in the 7th century. Let me check... I think he\
      \ was born around 573 CE and died in 634 CE. If that's correct, his lifespan\
      \ would be 634 minus 573, which is 61 years. So he was 61 when he died.\n\n\
      Next, George H. W. Bush. He was born on June 12, 1924, and died on November\
      \ 30, 2018. To find his age at death, subtract 1924 from 2018, which gives 94\

      \ had already passed that year. He was born in June, so by November 30, he would\
      \ have turned 94 in June 2018. So yes, he was 94 years old when he died.\n\n\
      Comparing the two, Abu Bakr died at 61 and George H. W. Bush at 94. So 61 is\
      \ definitely younger than 94. Therefore, the answer should be YES, Abu Bakr\

      Abu Bakr died at approximately 61 years old in 634 CE, while George H. W. Bush\

      \ of both historical figures when they passed away and compare them.\n\nFirst,\
      \ let's start with Abu Bakr. He was the first Caliph after Prophet Muhammad,\
      \ right? From what I remember, he was a close companion of Muhammad and took\
      \ over leadership after the Prophet's death in 632 CE. I think Abu Bakr's reign\
      \ was pretty short, maybe like two years? So, if he became Caliph around 632\
      \ and died in 634, that would make sense. Now, how old was he when he died?\
      \ I recall reading that there's some debate about his birth year because exact\
      \ records from that time might not be precise. Some sources say he was born\
      \ in 573 CE. If that's the case, subtracting 573 from 634 gives his age at death\
      \ as 61 years old. Wait, but I'm not 100% sure if the birth year is accurate.\
      \ I should double-check that. Another source might say 573-634, which would\
      \ make him 61. I think that's the commonly accepted age.\n\nNow, George H. W.\
      \ Bush. He was the 41st U.S. President and died more recently, so his dates\
      \ should be more accurate. He was born in 1924 and died in 2018. Let's calculate\
      \ his age. 2018 minus 1924 is 94 years old. So, he was 94 when he died. \n\n\
      Comparing the two, Abu Bakr was 61 and George H. W. Bush was 94. Therefore,\
      \ Abu Bakr was indeed younger at the time of his death. Wait, but I need to\
      \ make sure there's no mistake in the birth and death years of Abu Bakr. Let\
      \ me confirm. Some sources might have different dates, but the most commonly\
      \ cited ones are 573-634, which is 61 years. If there's a discrepancy, like\
      \ maybe some sources say he was born later, but I think 573 is the standard.\
      \ \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Hijri calendar comes into play? Abu Bakr's life\
      \ events are dated in the Islamic calendar, which is lunar. But when converting\
      \ to the Gregorian calendar, the years are adjusted. However, the key is the\
      \ actual age in solar years. Since the question is about their age at death\
      \ in years, I think the conversion is already accounted for in the 573-634 dates.\
      \ So 61 vs. 94. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be YES, Abu Bakr was younger\

      \ **Abu Bakr's Lifespan**: Born around 573 CE and died in 634 CE, he was approximately\

    6e8dec8d-7a76-4636-94f8-405e01e772b2: '<think>Okay, let''s try to figure this
      out. The question is whether Abu Bakr was younger at the time of his death than
      George H. W. Bush was when he died. So I need to find out the ages of both men
      when they died and compare them.


      First, let''s start with Abu Bakr. He was the first caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate,
      right? He was a close companion of the Prophet Muhammad and succeeded him after
      his death. From what I remember, the Prophet Muhammad died in 632 CE. Abu Bakr
      became caliph then and his reign was relatively short. I think he ruled for
      about two years before he passed away. So if he became caliph in 632 and died
      around 634 CE, that would place his death two years after becoming caliph. But
      how old was he when he died?


      I recall reading that Abu Bakr was born around 573 CE. If he died in 634 CE,
      subtracting his birth year from his death year gives 634 - 573 = 61 years old.
      Wait, but sometimes there are discrepancies in historical records, especially
      from that era. Let me double-check. Some sources might say he was born in 573
      and died in 634, making him 61. Others might have slightly different dates,
      but I think 61 is commonly accepted.


      Now, George H. W. Bush. He was the 41st president of the United States, and
      he died more recently. I believe he passed away in 2018. Let me confirm his
      birth year. He was born on June 12, 1924. So if he died in 2018, his age would
      be 2018 - 1924 = 94 years old. That sounds right because I remember hearing
      he was in his mid-90s when he died.


      Putting that together: Abu Bakr died at approximately 61, and George H. W. Bush
      at 94. Therefore, Abu Bakr was younger at the time of his death. The answer
      should be YES. Wait, but I need to make sure there''s no mistake in the dates.
      Let me verify Abu Bakr''s lifespan again. If he was born in 573 and died in
      634, 634 minus 573 is definitely 61. And George H. W. Bush''s dates are pretty
      well-documented, so 1924 to 2018 is 94 years. So yes, 61 is younger than 94.
      Therefore, the answer is YES.</think>Abu Bakr was born around 573 CE and died
      in 634 CE, making him approximately **61 years old** at his death. George H.
      W. Bush was born in 1924 and died in 2018, living to **94 years old**. Since
      61 is younger than 94, the answer is:


      **YES**'

    11074187-dfbe-4ac1-856a-1d7f5409df8b: "<think>Alright, let's try to figure this\
      \ out. Okay, the question is whether Diana, Princess of Wales was younger when\
      \ she died compared to Humphrey Bogart when he died. Hmm, I need to find out\
      \ both of their ages at the time of their deaths and then compare them.\n\n\
      First, let's start with Diana. I know she was Princess Diana, right? She died\
      \ in a car crash in Paris. I think that was in 1997. Now, her birth year...\
      \ I remember she was born in 1961. Let me double-check that. So if she was born\
      \ in 1961 and died in 1997, subtracting 1961 from 1997 gives her age. Let me\
      \ do the math: 1997 minus 1961. That's 36 years old. Wait, but she died in August\
      \ 1997, and her birthday was in July, right? So if her birthday was July 1st,\
      \ 1961, then by August 31st, 1997, she would have just turned 36. So yes, she\
      \ was 36 when she died.\n\nNow, Humphrey Bogart. He was an actor from the classic\
      \ Hollywood era. I think he died in the late 1950s. Let me recall... He was\
      \ in Casablanca, which was during World War II. But when did he die? I believe\
      \ it was in 1957. His birth year... I'm not as sure. Maybe 1899? If he was born\
      \ in 1899 and died in 1957, then his age would be 1957 - 1899. Let's calculate\
      \ that: 1957 minus 1899. That would be 58 years old. Wait, but wait, he was\
      \ born on December 25, 1899, and died on January 14, 1957. So even if he died\
      \ in January 1957, he would have turned 57 in December 1956, and then died a\
      \ few weeks later. So he was 57 when he died. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.\
      \ Let's see: 1957 minus 1899. 1899 plus 58 is 1957, so yeah, 58? Wait, no. Wait,\
      \ from 1899 to 1957 is 58 years, but if he died before his birthday in 1957,\
      \ he would have been 57. But his birthday is December 25th. He died on January\
      \ 14th, which is after his birthday. So in December 1956, he turned 57, and\
      \ then died in January 1957. So he was 57 years old at death. Wait, but 1957\
      \ - 1899 = 58, but since he hadn't had his birthday in 1957 yet? Wait, wait,\
      \ no. Wait, he was born in 1899, so in 1899 he was 0, 1900 he's 1, etc. So 1957\
      \ - 1899 = 58, but if he died in January 1957 before turning 58 in December\
      \ 1957, no, his birthday was in December. Wait, wait, he was born on December\
      \ 25, 1899. So in 1956, he turned 57. Then in 1957, he would turn 58 on December\
      \ 25, 1957. But he died on January 14, 1957, which is before his birthday in\
      \ 1957. So he was still 57 years old when he died. Wait, no. Wait, let's think\
      \ again. If you are born in December 25, 1899, then on December 25, 1956, you\
      \ turn 57. Then, the next year, 1957, your next birthday would be December 25,\
      \ 1957, when you turn 58. But since he died on January 14, 1957, which is after\
      \ December 25, 1956 (he already turned 57) and before December 25, 1957, he\
      \ was 57 years old at death. Wait, but wait: 1957 minus 1899 is 58 years. But\
      \ depending on the exact dates, he might have been 57 years and a few weeks\
      \ old. So perhaps the age is 57. So maybe some sources say 57, others 58? I\
      \ need to confirm. Let me check my facts. From what I remember, Humphrey Bogart\
      \ was born December 25, 1899, and died January 14, 1957. So calculating his\
      \ age: from December 25, 1899, to December 25, 1956, is exactly 57 years. Then\
      \ he died on January 14, 1957, which is 20 days after his 57th birthday. Therefore,\
      \ he was 57 years old when he died. So that would make his age at death 57.\
      \ Wait, but if you just subtract the years, 1957 - 1899 = 58. But since he didn't\
      \ reach his 58th birthday, you subtract one year. So 57 years old.\n\nSo Diana\
      \ was 36, Bogart was 57. Therefore, Diana was younger at her time of death than\
      \ Humphrey Bogart at his. So the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step\
      \ Explanation:**  \n1. **Princess Diana's Age at Death:**  \n   - Born July\
      \ 1, 1961.  \n   - Died August 31, 1997.  \n   - Age: 1997 - 1961 = **36 years\

    636c7242-4904-4b9c-b099-b0a258f07b4e: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The question is whether Diana, Princess of Wales was younger\
      \ at the time of her death than Humphrey Bogart was when he died. \n\nFirst,\
      \ I need to figure out the birth and death dates of both individuals. Let me\
      \ start with Diana. I remember that Diana died in a car accident in Paris in\
      \ 1997. I think she was born in the early 1960s. Let me recall her exact birth\
      \ date. Diana was born on July 1, 1961. She died on August 31, 1997. To find\
      \ her age at death, I subtract her birth year from her death year: 1997 - 1961\
      \ = 36 years. But since her birthday is in July and she died in August, she\
      \ had already turned 36 that year, so she was 36 years old when she passed away.\n\
      \nNow, Humphrey Bogart. He's a classic film actor, known for movies like Casablanca.\
      \ I need his birth and death dates. Bogart was born on December 25, 1899. He\
      \ died in 1957, I believe. Let me confirm. Yes, Humphrey Bogart died on January\
      \ 14, 1957. Calculating his age at death: 1957 - 1899 = 58 years. But his birthday\
      \ is in December, and he died in January 1957. So he was 57 years old when he\
      \ died because he hadn't reached his birthday yet in 1957. Wait, December 25,\
      \ 1899 to January 14, 1957: he would have turned 57 on December 25, 1956, so\
      \ by January 14, 1957, he was 57 years and a few weeks old. Therefore, Bogart\
      \ was 57 when he died.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\
      \ If he was born in 1899, subtracting 1899 from 1957 gives 58 years. But since\
      \ he died in January 1957, before his birthday in December, he was actually\
      \ 57 years old. So 1957 - 1899 = 58, but since his birthday hadn't occurred\
      \ yet in 1957, subtract one year: 57 years old.\n\nSo Diana was 36, Bogart was\
      \ 57. Therefore, yes, Diana was younger at her time of death than Bogart was\
      \ at his.\n</think>Diana, Princess of Wales was born on July 1, 1961, and died\

      \ Since he passed away before his 58th birthday in 1957, he was **57 years old**\
      \ at his death. \n\n**ANSWER: YES**"
    6fe1adf1-5fe1-46c8-8648-946f92bf8d7f: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Diana, Princess of Wales was younger when she died compared to Humphrey\

      \ deaths and then compare them. \n\nFirst, I should recall their birth years\
      \ and death years. Let me start with Diana. I know she was born in 1961, right?\
      \ She was part of the British royal family, married to Prince Charles. Her death\
      \ was in a car accident in Paris, which I think happened in 1997. So if she\
      \ was born in 1961 and died in 1997, her age would be 1997 minus 1961. Let me\
      \ calculate that: 1997 minus 1961 is 36. So Diana was 36 years old when she\
      \ died.\n\nNow, Humphrey Bogart. He's an old Hollywood actor, famous for movies\
      \ like Casablanca. I need his birth and death years. I think he was born in\
      \ the late 1800s or early 1900s. Wait, no, he was in classic films from the\
      \ 1940s and 50s. Let me check. I recall he was born in 1899. His death year...\
      \ I think he died in the 1950s. Maybe 1957? Let me confirm. Yes, Humphrey Bogart\

      \  \nDiana, Princess of Wales was born in 1961 and died in 1997 at age 36. Humphrey\

      \ 57, the answer is YES."
    898b9bf1-640e-4693-8685-38c59571dae2: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out whether\
      \ Diana, Princess of Wales was younger when she died compared to Humphrey Bogart\
      \ when he died. Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I should get\
      \ their birth years and death years. Let me recall. Diana, Princess of Wales\u2014\
      she was born in 1961, I think. She died in 1997, right? That car crash in Paris.\
      \ So her birth year is 1961, death at 1997. \n\nThen Humphrey Bogart. He's an\
      \ older actor, classic Hollywood. I know he was in Casablanca, which was during\
      \ the 1940s. He must have been born around the early 1900s. Let me think, maybe\
      \ 1899? Wait, no, maybe 1899 is right. And when did he die? I think he died\
      \ in the 1950s. Maybe 1957? I'm not 100% sure, but around there.\n\nSo let's\
      \ verify those dates. Diana: born July 1, 1961, died August 31, 1997. So her\
      \ age at death would be 1997 minus 1961. Let me calculate that: 1997 - 1961\
      \ = 36 years. So Diana was 36 when she died.\n\nNow Humphrey Bogart. If he was\
      \ born in 1899 and died in 1957, that's 1957 - 1899 = 58 years old. Wait, but\
      \ I'm not sure if I got his death year right. Let me think again. Humphrey Bogart\
      \ died in 1957, I think that's correct. So 1957 minus 1899 is 58. So he was\
      \ 58 when he died.\n\nSo comparing the two: Diana was 36, Bogart was 58. Therefore,\
      \ yes, Diana was younger at her time of death than Humphrey Bogart was at his.\
      \ So the answer should be YES.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the birth and\

      \ he was born December 25, 1899, and died January 14, 1957. So if he died in\
      \ January 1957, subtract 1899 from 1957. 1957 - 1899 = 58. Correct. And Diana's\
      \ dates: born 1961, died 1997. 1997 - 1961 = 36. So yes, 36 vs. 58. Diana was\

      \ him 57 years old (58, considering the dates, as he died in 1957: 1957 - 1899\
      \ = 58). \n\n**Answer:** YES."
    8c09de6a-6829-4136-89e1-5eaa60a1c85b: "<think>Okay, let's see. I need to figure\
      \ out if Diana, Princess of Wales was younger when she died compared to Humphrey\
      \ Bogart when he died. \n\nFirst, I should find out when each of them was born\
      \ and when they died. Then calculate their ages at the time of death.\n\nStarting\
      \ with Diana. I remember she died in a car crash in Paris in 1997. Her full\
      \ name was Diana Spencer. She was married to Prince Charles. I think she was\
      \ born around the 1960s. Let me recall... Oh right, Diana was born on July 1,\
      \ 1961. She died on August 31, 1997. So to find her age at death, subtract 1961\
      \ from 1997. 1997 minus 1961 is 36 years. But wait, her birthday is in July\
      \ and she died in August, so she had already turned 36 that year. So she was\
      \ 36 years old when she died.\n\nNow Humphrey Bogart. He's an old Hollywood\
      \ actor. I think he was in Casablanca. When did he die? I believe he died in\
      \ the 1950s. Humphrey Bogart's birth year... Maybe 1899? Let me check my memory.\
      \ Yes, Humphrey Bogart was born on December 25, 1899. He died on January 14,\
      \ 1957. So calculating his age: 1957 minus 1899. Let's do the math. 1957 - 1899\
      \ = 58. But he died in January 1957, and his birthday is in December. So in\
      \ January 1957, he hadn't turned 58 yet, right? Wait, wait. He was born in 1899,\
      \ so from December 25, 1899, to December 25, 1956, he would have been 57. Then\
      \ from December 25, 1956, to January 14, 1957, he was 57 years and a few weeks\
      \ old. But he died in January 1957 at age 57. Because he hadn't had his 58th\
      \ birthday yet.\n\nWait, but wait: 1957 minus 1899. Let's do 1957 - 1900 = 57,\
      \ then add 1 because it's 1899 instead of 1900. So 57 +1 = 58. Hmm, but if he\
      \ died before his birthday in 1957, he would still be 57. His birthday was December\
      \ 25. He died on January 14. So from December 25, 1956 (his 57th birthday) to\
      \ January 14, 1957, he was 57 years old. Therefore, his age at death was 57\
      \ years and about 20 days. So he was 57, not 58.\n\nWait, that's conflicting.\
      \ Let me verify. If born in 1899, then in 1957, he would be 1957 - 1899 = 58\
      \ years old. But wait, date matters. Let's break it down: He was born December\
      \ 25, 1899. On December 25, 1956, he turned 57. Then December 25, 1957, he would\
      \ have turned 58. But he died on January 14, 1957. So between December 25, 1956\
      \ and January 14, 1957, he was 57 years old. So his age at death was 57 years,\
      \ 20 days. Therefore, he was 57 when he died.\n\nWait, but 1957 minus 1899 is\
      \ 58. So how does that work? Because if you subtract 1899 from 1957, you get\
      \ 58, but if he hadn't reached his birthday in 1957, he would still be 57. So\
      \ the age calculation is based on the actual dates, not just the years. So if\
      \ someone is born on December 25, 1899, and dies on January 14, 1957, they have\
      \ not yet had their 58th birthday. Therefore, their age is 57 years old.\n\n\
      So Humphrey Bogart was 57 when he died. Diana was 36. Therefore, Diana was younger\
      \ at her time of death than Humphrey Bogart was at his. So the answer is YES,\
      \ she was younger.\n\nWait, but wait another second. Let me confirm the dates\
      \ again. Diana: July 1, 1961, to August 31, 1997. So 1997 - 1961 = 36. Since\
      \ her birthday was in July, and she died in August, she had already had her\
      \ 36th birthday. So 36 years old.\n\nBogart: December 25, 1899, to January 14,\
      \ 1957. So 1957 - 1899 = 58. But he died before his 58th birthday. So his age\
      \ was 57. Therefore, 57 years old. So 57 is older than 36. Therefore, Diana\
      \ was younger. So the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \nDiana, Princess of Wales\
      \ was born on July 1, 1961, and died on August 31, 1997, at age 36. Humphrey\
      \ Bogart was born on December 25, 1899, and died on January 14, 1957. Although\
      \ subtracting birth and death years suggests 58, Bogart died before his 58th\

      \ time of her death."

      \ \n\nFirst, Princess Diana. I know she died in a car crash in Paris. I think\
      \ that was in 1997. She was often called \"the People's Princess.\" Now, her\

      \ 37, so minus one more year would make her 36 years old. Wait, no, wait. If\
      \ her birthday was after the date of her death, she might have been 36, but\
      \ if she was born in, say, July and died in August, then she would have just\
      \ turned 36. But wait, I think Diana was born on July 1, 1961, and she died\
      \ on August 31, 1997. So from July 1, 1961, to July 1, 1997, that's 36 years.\

      \ the 1950s. Let me recall. I remember he was born in 1899. When did he die?\
      \ I think he died in 1957. Let me check that in my mind. I recall that he was\
      \ married to Lauren Bacall, and he died of cancer. So, if he was born in 1899\
      \ and died in 1957, his age would be 1957 minus 1899. Let me calculate that.\
      \ 1957 minus 1900 is 57, so adding back the 1 year makes it 58. Wait, 1957 -\
      \ 1899. Let's do it step by step. 1899 +58 years would be 1957. Yes, 1899 +58\

      \ The question is whether Diana, Princess of Wales was younger when she died\
      \ compared to Humphrey Bogart when he died. \n\nFirst, I need to find out the\
      \ dates of birth and death for both individuals. Let's start with Diana. I remember\
      \ that Diana died in a car crash in Paris in 1997. Her full name was Diana Spencer,\
      \ and she was often called Princess Diana. She was married to Prince Charles.\
      \ Now, her birth year... I think she was born in 1961. Let me confirm that.\
      \ Yes, Diana was born on July 1, 1961, and she died on August 31, 1997. So to\
      \ calculate her age at death, subtract 1961 from 1997. That would make her 36\
      \ years old when she died, right? Because 1997 minus 1961 is 36, and her birthday\
      \ was in July, so she had already turned 36 that year before her death in August.\n\
      \nNow, Humphrey Bogart. He's the classic actor, right? Starred in films like\
      \ Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon. I need his birth and death years. He was\
      \ from an older era. Let me recall. I think he was born in 1899. Wait, but when\
      \ did he die? I remember he died in the 1950s, maybe 1957? Let me check that.\
      \ Yes, Humphrey Bogart was born on December 25, 1899, and he died on January\
      \ 14, 1957. So to calculate his age at death, subtract 1899 from 1957. That\
      \ gives 58 years. But wait, since his birthday was in December, and he died\
      \ in January 1957, he had just turned 57 the previous December. Wait, let me\
      \ do the math properly. From December 25, 1899 to December 25, 1956, that's\
      \ exactly 57 years. Then he died on January 14, 1957, which is 20 days after\
      \ his 57th birthday. So he was 57 years and 20 days old at the time of death.\
      \ So his age was 57.\n\nSo Diana was 36, Humphrey Bogart was 57. Therefore,\
      \ Diana was younger when she died. So the answer is YES, she was younger than\
      \ Humphrey Bogart at their respective times of death.\n</think>YES  \nDiana,\
      \ Princess of Wales was born on July 1, 1961, and died on August 31, 1997, at\
      \ age 36. Humphrey Bogart was born on December 25, 1899, and died on January\

      So, Princess Diana, I remember she was born in 1961. When did she die? That\

      \nNow Humphrey Bogart. He's an older actor, classic Hollywood. I think he was\

      \ years old. Wait, but if his birthday was later in the year, and he died in\
      \ January, maybe he was 57. Hmm. Let me check. I think Bogart was born on December\
      \ 25, 1899. If he died in January 1957, then he would have been 57 years old\
      \ because he hadn't reached his birthday that year. Wait, but I'm not sure of\

      \ his birthday would be in December. So 1957 minus 1899 is 58, but since he\
      \ died before his birthday in 1957, he was 57. Wait, no. Wait, 1957 minus 1899:\
      \ 1899 + 58 = 1957. So if he died after his birthday in 1957, he would be 58.\
      \ If he died before, 57. But I think he died in January 1957, which is before\
      \ his December birthday. So he was 57 years old at death.\n\nWait, but I'm a\
      \ bit confused here. Let me double-check. Humphrey Bogart's birth date is December\
      \ 25, 1899. Death date is January 14, 1957. So from December 25, 1899, to December\
      \ 25, 1956, he would be 57. Then he died on January 14, 1957, which is after\
      \ his 57th birthday? Wait, no. Wait, December 25, 1956, would be his 57th birthday.\
      \ So from December 25, 1956, to January 14, 1957, he was 57 years old. So he\
      \ was 57 when he died. Wait, but 1957 minus 1899 is 58 years. Wait, that's conflicting.\
      \ Let me do the math. 1957 - 1899. Let's subtract: 1899 + 58 = 1957. So the\
      \ difference is 58 years. But since he died in January 1957, which is only a\
      \ few weeks after his 57th birthday (if his birthday was in December 1899),\
      \ then he was 57 years and about 20 days old. Wait, but the calculation by years\
      \ would be 58, but his age in years would be 57 because he hadn't completed\
      \ the 58th year. Wait, no. Age is counted as the number of completed years.\
      \ So if you're born on December 25, 1899, then on December 25, 1956, you turn\
      \ 57. Then on January 14, 1957, you are 57 years old, and you haven't turned\
      \ 58 yet. So his age at death is 57. But the subtraction gives 58. Hmm, this\
      \ is a common confusion. So the correct way is to subtract the birth year from\
      \ the death year and then adjust if the death date is before the birthday. So\
      \ 1957 - 1899 = 58, but since he died before his birthday in 1957 (if he died\
      \ in January, which is before December), he was 57. Wait, but his birthday is\
      \ in December, so if he died in January 1957, he had not yet had his birthday\
      \ in 1957. Wait, no. Wait, the birthday in 1957 would be December 25, 1957.\
      \ But he died in January 1957, so his last birthday was December 25, 1956. So\
      \ from December 25, 1956, to January 14, 1957, he was 57 years old. Therefore,\
      \ his age at death was 57. So 57 years old.\n\nDiana was 36. So 36 vs. 57. Therefore,\
      \ yes, Diana was younger at her time of death than Humphrey Bogart was at his.\n\
      </think>Diana, Princess of Wales was born on July 1, 1961, and died on August\
      \ 31, 1997, making her 36 years old at the time of her death. Humphrey Bogart\

      \ simple subtraction (1957 - 1899) suggests 58 years, Bogart died **before**\
      \ his 1957 birthday, so his age at death was 57. Since 36 < 57, the answer is:\n\
      \n**YES**"

    0b785d3e-08aa-490d-a5cb-b8ffa9bb7776: '<think>Okay, let''s figure this out. The
      question is whether John Lewis was younger when he died than Coco Chanel was
      when she died. Alright, I need to find out their birth and death years, calculate
      their ages at death, and compare them.


      First, let me recall who these people are. John Lewis was a civil rights leader
      and U.S. politician, right? I think he passed away recently, maybe in 2020?
      As for Coco Chanel, she''s the famous fashion designer. She was French, and
      I remember she lived a long time ago. Let me try to get the dates right.


      John Lewis: Born in 1940, I believe. His death was in July 2020. So if he was
      born in 1940 and died in 2020, that would make him 80 years old at death. Wait,
      2020 minus 1940 is 80, so that''s correct.


      Coco Chanel: Her full name was Gabrielle Bonheur Chanel. She was born in 1883,
      if I''m not mistaken. And she died in 1971. Let''s verify that. Yes, she was
      born on August 19, 1883, and died on January 10, 1971. So calculating her age:
      1971 minus 1883. Let''s do the math. 1971 minus 1883. 1883 + 88 = 1971, so 88
      years old. Wait, no. 1883 + 80 = 1963, then +8 more years would be 1971. So
      88 years old. So she was 87 when she died? Wait, wait, maybe I''m miscalculating.
      Let''s subtract 1971 - 1883. Subtract 1883 from 1971: 1971 - 1883. 1971 minus
      1880 is 91, then minus 3 more is 88. So yes, 88 years old.


      So John Lewis was 80, Coco Chanel was 88. Therefore, John Lewis was younger
      at his time of death than Coco Chanel. So the answer should be YES.

      </think>John Lewis was born on February 21, 1940, and died on July 17, 2020,

      Since 80 < 87, the answer is:

      \ I need to find out both of their ages at the time of their deaths and compare\

      \nFirst, John Lewis. I remember he was a civil rights leader in the United States.\
      \ I think he was quite young during the 1960s Civil Rights Movement, but he\
      \ lived a long life. I believe he passed away more recently, maybe in 2020?\
      \ If that's the case, let's figure out his birth year. If he died in 2020, and\
      \ if he was, say, around 80, he might have been born in the 1940s. Let me check\
      \ my memory. Wait, John Lewis was born on February 21, 1940, and he died on\
      \ July 17, 2020. So calculating his age at death: 2020 minus 1940 is 80 years.\
      \ But wait, he died in July, so he had already turned 80 that February. So he\
      \ was 80 years old when he died.\n\nNow, Coco Chanel. She was a French fashion\
      \ designer. I think she lived a long time, maybe into her 80s or 90s. Let me\
      \ recall. Coco Chanel was born on August 19, 1883, and she died on January 10,\
      \ 1971. So to calculate her age: 1971 minus 1883. Let's do the math. 1883 plus\
      \ 88 years is 1971, but since her birthday is in August and she died in January,\
      \ she hadn't turned 88 yet in 1971. So 1971 minus 1883 equals 88 years minus\
      \ the months from January to August. Wait, 1883 to 1971 is 88 years. But since\
      \ she died in January 1971, she was 87 years old, because her birthday was in\
      \ August. So 87 years old at death.\n\nNow comparing the two: John Lewis was\

      \ on January 10, 1971, making her 87 years old at her death. \n\n**ANSWER: YES**"
    3e1c380d-7a1c-46d1-9a52-7090b3b72cbb: '<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if
      John Lewis was younger when he died compared to Coco Chanel when she died. Let
      me start by recalling their birth and death years.


      First, John Lewis. I know he was a civil rights leader and a U.S. congressman.
      I think he passed away recently. Let me check my memory. Wait, I remember that
      he died in 2020. His birth year... I''m not exactly sure, but I think he was
      in his 80s. Wait, no, maybe 80? Let me think. He was born in 1940, I believe,
      because he was one of the younger leaders during the civil rights movement in
      the 1960s. If he died in 2020, that would make him 80 years old.


      Now, Coco Chanel. She was a fashion designer, right? She founded the Chanel
      brand. I''m pretty sure she lived a long life. Let me recall. She was born in
      the late 19th century. I think her birth year was 1883. And she died in 1971.
      Let me confirm that. Yes, Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel was born on August 19, 1883,
      and died on January 10, 1971. So if she died in 1971, that would make her 87
      years old at the time of her death (1971 minus 1883 equals 88, but since her
      birthday is in August and she died in January, she was 87).


      So John Lewis was born in 1940 and died in 2020. 2020 minus 1940 is 80 years
      old. Coco Chanel was 87 when she died. Comparing the two, 80 is less than 87.
      Therefore, John Lewis was younger at his time of death than Coco Chanel.

      </think>John Lewis was born on February 21, 1940, and died on July 17, 2020,
      making him 80 years old. Coco Chanel was born on August 19, 1883, and died on
      January 10, 1971, making her 87 years old. Since 80 is less than 87, the answer
      is YES.


      YES'
    5d18c693-dada-42b3-9998-a13f130c15e0: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. So, the question is: Was John Lewis younger at his time of death\
      \ than Coco Chanel at her time of death? I need to figure out the ages of both\
      \ when they died and compare them. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the birth and\
      \ death years for both individuals. Let me start with John Lewis. I know he\
      \ was a prominent civil rights leader in the United States. From what I remember,\
      \ he was quite young during the 1960s Civil Rights Movement, like being part\
      \ of the Freedom Riders and the Selma to Montgomery marches. I think he passed\
      \ away more recently, maybe around 2020. Wait, yes, John Lewis died in July\
      \ 2020. Now, his birth year\u2014I think he was born in 1940. Let me confirm\
      \ that. Yeah, John Lewis was born on February 21, 1940, and died on July 17,\
      \ 2020. So to calculate his age at death: 2020 minus 1940 is 80 years old.\n\
      \nNow, Coco Chanel. She's the famous French fashion designer. She was around\
      \ during the early to mid-20th century. I believe she lived a long life. I recall\
      \ that she was born in the late 1800s. Let me check her dates. Coco Chanel was\
      \ born on August 19, 1883, and died on January 10, 1971. So calculating her\
      \ age at death: 1971 minus 1883. Let's see, 1883 plus 87 is 1970, so 1970 minus\
      \ 1883 is 87, but she died in 1971, so that would be 87 + 1 = 88 years old.\

      \ was indeed younger at his time of death.\n\nANSWER: YES"
    86411ea7-99fb-4492-99cb-6e46939c8289: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ The user wants to know if John Lewis was younger at the time of his death\

      \ calculate their ages, and compare them. \n\nFirst, I should start with John\
      \ Lewis. From what I remember, John Lewis was a prominent civil rights leader\
      \ and U.S. Congressman. I think he passed away recently. Let me recall... I\
      \ believe he died in 2020. His birth year? Maybe around 1940? Let me confirm:\
      \ John Lewis was born on February 21, 1940, and died on July 17, 2020. So, to\
      \ calculate his age at death: 2020 minus 1940. That would be 80 years old.\n\
      \nNow, Coco Chanel. She's the famous fashion designer. I know she lived a long\
      \ life. She was born in the late 19th century. Her birth year is 1883, if I'm\
      \ not mistaken. And her death... I think she died in 1971. Let me check: Coco\
      \ Chanel was born on August 19, 1883, and died on January 10, 1971. So her age\
      \ at death would be 1971 minus 1883. Let's do the math. 1971 - 1883. Subtract\
      \ 1880 from 1971: that's 91. Then subtract the remaining 3: 91 -3 = 88. Wait,\
      \ no, 1883 to 1971. Alternatively, 1971-1883: 1883 + 88 = 1971? Let's see: 1883\
      \ + 80 = 1963, then +8 = 1971. So 88 years. So she was 87 when she died? Wait,\
      \ maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me do it properly. 1971 minus 1883. \n\nStarting\
      \ from 1883 to 1900 is 17 years. Then from 1900 to 1971 is 71 years. So 17 +\
      \ 71 = 88. So she was 87 years old? Wait, no. If someone is born in 1883 and\
      \ dies in 1971, subtracting gives 88 years. But you have to account for the\
      \ exact birth and death dates. She was born in August and died in January, so\
      \ she hadn't yet reached her 88th birthday in 1971. Let's check: August 19,\
      \ 1883, to January 10, 1971. From August 19, 1883, to August 19, 1970, that's\
      \ 87 years. Then from August 19, 1970, to January 10, 1971, is 4 months and\
      \ some days. So she was 87 years old when she died. Wait, but the calculation\
      \ by subtraction (1971-1883) gives 88, but because her birthday was in August\
      \ and she died in January, she hadn't turned 88 yet. So her age was 87 years,\
      \ 4 months, and 22 days or something. But usually, when people state age at\
      \ death, they subtract the years and adjust if the birthday hadn't occurred\
      \ yet. So in that case, Coco Chanel was 87 years old at death.\n\nJohn Lewis\

      \ step by step. So, the question is whether Idi Amin was younger at the time\
      \ of his death than Little Richard was when he died. To figure this out, I need\
      \ to find out the birth years and death years of both individuals, calculate\
      \ their ages at death, and then compare them.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some\
      \ basic information about these two people. Idi Amin was a Ugandan dictator,\
      \ right? I think he was in power during the 70s. As for Little Richard, he's\
      \ the famous rock and roll musician, known for hits in the 50s and 60s. \n\n\
      Let me start with Idi Amin. From what I remember, he died in 2003. But when\
      \ was he born? I think he was born around the 1920s. Wait, maybe I should be\
      \ precise. Let me check my memory: Idi Amin's birth year is often cited as 1925,\
      \ but some sources say between 1923 and 1928 because of uncertain records in\
      \ Uganda at the time. However, the commonly accepted year is 1925. He died in\
      \ August 2003. So, if he was born in 1925, that would make him 78 years old\
      \ when he died (2003 - 1925 = 78). But if his birth year was earlier, say 1923,\
      \ he would be 80. But since the standard is 1925, let's go with 78 for now.\n\
      \nNow, Little Richard. His real name was Richard Wayne Penniman. I know he passed\
      \ away more recently. I think he died in 2020. Let me confirm. Yes, he died\
      \ on May 9, 2020. His birth date was December 5, 1932. So, he was born in 1932\
      \ and died in 2020. Calculating his age: 2020 - 1932 = 88 years old. Wait, but\
      \ let me be exact. From December 5, 1932, to May 9, 2020. So, from December\
      \ 5, 1932, to December 5, 2019, he would be 87. Then from December 2019 to May\
      \ 2020 is 5 months. So, he was 87 years and 5 months old, which is 87 years\
      \ old. Wait, but when you subtract 1932 from 2020, you get 88, but because his\
      \ birthday is in December, he hadn't turned 88 yet when he died in May. So he\
      \ was 87 years old at death.\n\nWait, no. Let's double-check the math. If he\
      \ was born in 1932, subtract that from 2020: 2020 - 1932 = 88. But since he\
      \ died in May 2020, before his birthday in December, he would be 87 years old.\
      \ Because you don't count the year until the birthday has passed. So, yes, 87\
      \ years old.\n\nSo, Idi Amin died at 78 (if born 1925) and Little Richard at\
      \ 87. Therefore, Amin was younger when he died than Little Richard. So the answer\
      \ is YES.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about Amin's exact age. If he was\
      \ born in 1925 and died in 2003: 2003 - 1925 = 78. But if his birthday was after\
      \ August (since he died in August 2003), then if he was born in, say, December\
      \ 1925, he would have been 77 years old at death. But I think his birthday is\
      \ around 1925, but exact dates might vary. Let me confirm Idi Amin's date of\
      \ birth. Checking my memory: His exact birth date is uncertain, but it's often\
      \ listed as 17 May 1928 in some sources, but other sources say 1925. Wait, this\
      \ is conflicting. Hmm, this is a problem. If Amin was born in 1928, then his\
      \ age at death in 2003 would be 75. If he was born in 1925, 78. But I need to\
      \ check which is more accurate.\n\nWait, according to reliable sources, the\
      \ exact birth year of Idi Amin is a matter of dispute. Some biographies say\
      \ he was born around 1925, but others suggest 1928. For example, his official\
      \ biography by a Ugandan researcher states he was born on 17 May 1928. If that's\
      \ the case, then 2003 minus 1928 is 75. However, other sources, including some\
      \ earlier records, list 1925. This discrepancy could be due to lack of proper\
      \ birth records. So this complicates things. Therefore, if we take the 1928\
      \ date, he died at 75; if 1925, 78. Little Richard was 87. In either case, Amin\
      \ would still be younger. But to be precise, we need to confirm the most accurate\
      \ birth year for Idi Amin.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can check Little Richard's\
      \ exact age again. He was born on December 5, 1932, died on May 9, 2020. From\
      \ December 5, 1932, to December 5, 2019, that's 87 years. Then from December\
      \ 5, 2019, to May 9, 2020, that's 5 months and 4 days. So he was 87 years old\
      \ when he died. Therefore, 87 years.\n\nIf Amin was 75 or 78, then he was younger.\
      \ Therefore, regardless of whether Amin was 75 or 78, he was younger than Little\
      \ Richard's 87. So the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine if Idi Amin was\

      \ he died in **2003** at **78**. If born in **1928**, he would be **75** at\
      \ death. Both ages are under 80.  \n- **Little Richard**: Born December 5, **1932**,\
      \ died May 9, **2020**. He was **87** years old (had not yet turned 88 by his\
      \ December birthday).  \n\nRegardless of Amin's disputed birth year (75 or 78),\
      \ he was younger than Little Richard (87).  \n\n**ANSWER: YES**"
    2f22d6fb-4e1c-488e-bd5a-63ec705304ac: '<think>Okay, let''s see. The question is
      whether Idi Amin was younger at his time of death than Little Richard was when
      he died. So I need to find out both of their ages when they passed away and
      compare them.


      First, I should recall who these people are. Idi Amin was a Ugandan dictator,
      right? He was the President of Uganda in the 70s, known for his brutal regime.
      Little Richard was a famous American singer and rock and roll pioneer, I think
      he was active in the 50s and beyond.


      Now, I need their birth years and death years. Let me start with Idi Amin. From
      what I remember, he died in 2003. But I''m not 100% sure. Let me check mentally.
      He was overthrown in 1979 and went into exile, and I think he lived for a couple
      more decades. So if he died in 2003, then his birth year... I think he was born
      around 1925 or so. Let me see, if he was 78 when he died, that would make his
      birth year 1925 (2003-78=1925). Wait, but I need to confirm his actual birth
      date. I recall that some sources say he was born around 1925, maybe 1928. Hmm,
      maybe I should get exact dates.


      For Little Richard, his death was more recent. I think he passed away in 2020.
      His birth year was 1932, I believe. So if he died in 2020, that would make him
      87 years old (2020-1932=88, but depending on the exact month). Wait, 1932 to
      2020 is 88 years. But maybe he was 87 if his birthday hadn''t occurred yet in
      2020. Let me think. Little Richard was born in December 1932, I think. If he
      died in May 2020, then he would still be 87, turning 88 in December. But I need
      to check the exact dates.


      So, let''s get precise. Idi Amin: born around 1925-1928, died in 2003. Let''s
      say he was born in 1925, so 2003-1925=78. If he was born in 1928, he would be
      75. Wait, I need to verify. A quick mental note: I think his birth year is often
      cited as 1925, but some sources say 1928. There''s some uncertainty because
      records in Uganda at the time weren''t always accurate. But the commonly accepted
      date is 1925. So if he died in 2003, that''s 78 years old.


      Little Richard: born December 5, 1932, died May 9, 2020. So from December 5,
      1932, to May 9, 2020. Let''s calculate his age. 2020 - 1932 = 88, but since
      he died in May, before his December birthday, he was 87 years old at death.
      Wait, no. Wait, from December 5, 1932, to December 5, 2020, would be 88 years.
      But he died in May 2020, so he was 87 years and about 5 months. So his age at
      death was 87.


      So Idi Amin died at 78, Little Richard at 87. Therefore, Idi Amin was younger
      when he died. So the answer is YES, because 78 is younger than 87.

      </think>To determine if Idi Amin was younger at his death than Little Richard,
      we compare their ages:


      - **Idi Amin** was born around 1925 and died in 2003, making him approximately
      **78 years old** at death.

      - **Little Richard** was born on December 5, 1932, and died on May 9, 2020.
      Calculating his age: 2020 - 1932 = 88, but since he died before his December
      birthday, he was **87 years old** at death.


      **YES**, Idi Amin was younger at his time of death than Little Richard.'

      \ in 1925 and died in 2003. That would make him 78 years old?\n\nNow Little\
      \ Richard. He's a famous musician, right? Rock and roll pioneer. He passed away\
      \ more recently. I think he died in 2020. His birth year... I believe he was\
      \ born in 1932. So if he died in 2020, he would be 87 years old? Because 2020\
      \ minus 1932 is 88, but if his birthday hadn't come yet, maybe 87. Wait, no,\
      \ let me calculate: 1932 to 2020 is 88 years. But exact dates might matter.\
      \ If he was born in December 1932 and died in May 2020, he would still be 87.\
      \ Hmm, not sure about the exact months. But the main thing is approximate age.\n\
      \nSo if Idi Amin died at 78 in 2003, and Little Richard died at 87 in 2020,\
      \ then yes, Idi Amin was younger at death. Wait, but wait, maybe I have the\
      \ dates wrong. Let me think again: Idi Amin's birth year is sometimes cited\
      \ as 1925, and death in 2003. So 2003 - 1925 = 78. Little Richard was born in\
      \ 1932, died in 2020: 2020 - 1932 = 88. So 78 vs 88. Therefore, Idi Amin was\
      \ younger when he died. So the answer is YES.\n</think>Idi Amin was born in\
      \ approximately 1925 and died in 2003, making him around 78 years old at his\

      \ him approximately 88 years old at his death. \n\n**Answer: YES**"

      \ whether Idi Amin was younger at his time of death than Little Richard was\
      \ when he died. So I need to find out both of their ages when they passed away\
      \ and compare them.\n\nFirst, I should recall their birth and death years. Let\
      \ me start with Idi Amin. I remember he was a Ugandan dictator, right? I think\
      \ he died in the early 2000s. Maybe around 2003? And he was born in the 1920s\
      \ or 1930s. Wait, I'm not exactly sure. Let me think. I recall that he was in\
      \ power during the 1970s, and he was ousted in 1979. If he was, say, in his\
      \ 50s then, that would put his birth year around the late 1920s. So if he died\
      \ in 2003, that would make him in his late 70s. Hmm, but I need to verify that.\n\
      \nNow, Little Richard. He's the famous musician, part of the early rock and\
      \ roll era. He died more recently, I think. Maybe around 2020? Let me check\
      \ my memory. Yes, I believe Little Richard passed away in May 2020. His birth\
      \ year was 1932, I think. So if he died in 2020, he would have been 87 or 88\
      \ years old. Wait, 2020 minus 1932 is 88. So he was 88 when he died.\n\nBack\
      \ to Idi Amin. Let me confirm his dates. A quick search in my mind: Idi Amin\
      \ was born around 1925, and he died on August 16, 2003. So 2003 minus 1925 is\
      \ 78 years old. So he was 78 when he died. \n\nComparing the two: Idi Amin died\

      \ (Amin) < 88 (Little Richard).  \n\nANSWER: YES"
    78de5202-3a69-4e43-a403-80a394a9cd78: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Idi Amin was younger at his time of death than Little Richard when\
      \ he died. Hmm, I need to figure out their birth years and death years, then\
      \ calculate their ages at death and compare them.\n\nFirst, I should recall\
      \ who these people were. Idi Amin was the dictator of Uganda, right? I think\
      \ he died maybe in the early 2000s? Wait, wasn't he in power during the 70s?\
      \ Let me think. I believe he was born around the 1920s or 1930s. As for his\
      \ death, I'm not exactly sure but maybe around 2003? I might be mixing him up\
      \ with someone else. \n\nThen there's Little Richard, the famous musician. He\
      \ was a rock and roll pioneer from the 50s. He lived a long life, I think. Maybe\
      \ he died more recently, like in the 2020s? Wait, didn't he pass away in 2020?\
      \ Yeah, that sounds right. So he was born in the 30s, maybe 1932? That would\
      \ make him in his late 80s when he died. \n\nWait, let me verify. Little Richard's\
      \ birth date: according to what I remember, he was born Richard Penniman on\
      \ December 5, 1932, and died on May 9, 2020. So that would make him 87 years\
      \ old when he died. \n\nNow, Idi Amin. He was born around 1925? Let me check\
      \ my memory. I think he was born around 1925 in Uganda. His death was in 2003.\
      \ If he was born in 1925 and died in 2003, his age at death would be 2003 minus\
      \ 1925, which is 78. So 78 years old. Comparing that to Little Richard's 87,\
      \ then yes, Idi Amin was younger at the time of his death. \n\nBut wait, maybe\
      \ I got the birth years wrong. Let me double-check. Idi Amin's exact birth date\
      \ is actually uncertain because records weren't well-kept. Some sources say\
      \ he was born between 1923 and 1928. But the commonly cited year is 1925. He\
      \ died in August 2003. So 2003 minus 1925 is 78. \n\nLittle Richard was born\
      \ in 1932, died in 2020. 2020 minus 1932 is 88. Wait, wait, 2020 minus 1932\
      \ is 88? Let me calculate that again. 1932 to 2000 is 68 years, then 2020 is\
      \ 20 more, so 88. But if he died in May 2020, and was born in December 1932,\
      \ he would have been 87 years and 5 months old. So, 87 years old at death. \n\
      \nSo, Idi Amin was 78, Little Richard was 87. Therefore, yes, Idi Amin was younger\
      \ when he died. The answer is YES.\n</think>**Answer:**  \nYES  \n\n**Explanation:**\
      \  \n- **Idi Amin** was born around 1925 (exact date uncertain) and died in\
      \ August 2003, making him approximately **78 years old** at death.  \n- **Little\

      \ **87 years old** at death.  \nSince 78 is younger than 87, **Idi Amin was\
      \ younger at his time of death than Little Richard**."
    88ec9cb7-40a4-466b-87e4-07ee14e80f65: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure this out.\
      \ The question is whether Idi Amin was younger at the time of his death than\
      \ Little Richard was when he died. So I need to find out both of their birth\
      \ years and death years, calculate their ages at death, and then compare them.\n\
      \nFirst, I should recall who these people are. Idi Amin was a Ugandan dictator,\
      \ right? He was the president of Uganda in the 70s, known for being really brutal.\
      \ Little Richard was a famous American singer and pioneer of rock and roll music.\
      \ I think he was active back in the 50s and 60s, songs like \"Tutti Frutti\"\
      \ and \"Long Tall Sally.\" \n\nNow, let's start with Idi Amin. I need his birth\
      \ and death dates. From what I remember, Idi Amin died in 2003. Wait, was that\
      \ correct? I think he was exiled to Saudi Arabia and died there. Let me confirm\
      \ his birth year. I think he was born around 1925 or so, maybe 1928? Wait, actually,\
      \ I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact dates. Let me think. He came to power in 1971,\
      \ right? And he was a military officer before that. If he was in his 40s when\
      \ he took power, that would place his birth in the late 1920s. Let me check\
      \ my memory: I think he was born in 1925 and died in 2003. So if that's correct,\
      \ he died at 78 years old. Wait, 2003 minus 1925 would be 78. But I'm not 100%\
      \ sure. Maybe I should verify.\n\nNow, Little Richard. His real name was Richard\
      \ Wayne Penniman. He was a big rock and roll star. I remember that he died relatively\
      \ recently, maybe around 2020? Let me think. Wait, he died in 2020, yes. But\
      \ when was he born? He was part of the first wave of rock and roll in the 1950s.\
      \ If he was in his 20s then, that would put his birth year in the early 1930s.\
      \ I think he was born in 1932. If he died in 2020, that would make him 87 or\
      \ 88 years old. Wait, 2020 minus 1932 is 88. Hmm. So he would have been 87 or\
      \ 88 when he died, depending on the exact birth date and death date.\n\nWait,\
      \ let's confirm. Little Richard was born on December 5, 1932, and died on May\
      \ 9, 2020. So that would make him 87 years old at death. Because from December\
      \ 5, 1932, to May 9, 2020: 2020 - 1932 = 88, but since he hadn't reached his\
      \ birthday in 2020 yet (May is before December), he was 87 years old. Wait,\
      \ no: if he died in May 2020, before his December birthday, he was 87 years\
      \ old. So 2020 minus 1932 is 88, but subtract one year because he didn't reach\
      \ his 88th birthday. Wait, no, actually, age is calculated by the number of\
      \ birthdays passed. So if he was born in December 1932, by May 2020, he would\
      \ have had his 87th birthday in December 2019, so he was 87 when he died.\n\n\
      But let's check Idi Amin's dates again. He was born around 1925? Let's confirm.\
      \ Upon checking, Idi Amin was born on 17 May 1928, and died on 16 August 2003.\
      \ So his age at death would be 2003 minus 1928. That's 75 years. Wait, 2003\
      \ minus 1928 is 75. But let's check the exact dates. From May 17, 1928, to August\
      \ 16, 2003. So in 2003, he had already celebrated his birthday in May, so 2003\
      \ - 1928 = 75 years old. So he was 75 when he died.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought\
      \ maybe he was 78. That must have been incorrect. Let me correct that. If he\
      \ was born in 1928 and died in 2003, that's 75 years. So that makes him 75.\
      \ Then Little Richard, born 1932, died 2020. Wait, 2020 -1932 is 88, but since\
      \ his birthday was in December, he was 87 years old at death. So 87 vs 75. Then\
      \ Idi Amin was younger at death (75) than Little Richard (87). Therefore, the\
      \ answer would be YES.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I have the correct dates.\
      \ Let me double-check.\n\nIdi Amin Dada: born 17 May 1928, died 16 August 2003.\
      \ So 2003 -1928 = 75. He turned 75 in May 2003 and died in August, so he was\
      \ 75. Correct.\n\nLittle Richard: born 5 December 1932, died 9 May 2020. So\
      \ from 1932 to 2020 is 87 years (since he hadn't turned 88 yet). 2020 -1932\
      \ = 88, but subtract 1 because he died before his December birthday. So 87.\n\
      \nTherefore, Idi Amin was 75, Little Richard was 87. So YES, Amin was younger\
      \ at death.\n</think>Idi Amin was born on May 17, 1928, and died on August 16,\

      \ old** (since he had not yet reached his 88th birthday). \n\nComparing their\
      \ ages at death:  \n75 (Amin) < 87 (Little Richard).  \n\n**YES**, Idi Amin\
      \ was younger at his time of death than Little Richard."
    a813c8b2-55ac-434b-9cf0-186700bdd4d2: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So the question is asking whether Idi Amin was younger when he died compared\
      \ to Little Richard at the time of their respective deaths. Hmm, I need to figure\
      \ out the birth and death years of both individuals first.\n\nStarting with\
      \ Idi Amin. I remember that Idi Amin was a Ugandan dictator. Let me recall his\
      \ lifespan. I think he was born around the 1920s, maybe mid-1920s. Wait, I think\
      \ he died in the early 2000s. Let me check my memory: Idi Amin was born in 1925\
      \ or 1926, and he died in 2003. Let me confirm that. Yes, he was born on 17\
      \ May 1925 and died on 16 August 2003. So that would make him 78 years old when\
      \ he died. Wait, 2003 minus 1925 is 78 years. \n\nNow, Little Richard. He was\
      \ a famous American musician, right? Rock and roll pioneer. When did he die?\
      \ I think he passed away more recently, maybe around 2020. Let me think. Oh\
      \ right, Little Richard died in 2020. His birth year, I believe, was 1932. So\
      \ if he was born in 1932 and died in 2020, that would make him 2020 minus 1932,\
      \ which is 88 years old. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the exact dates to be\
      \ sure. Little Richard was born on December 5, 1932, and he died on May 9, 2020.\
      \ So calculating his age at death: from 1932 to 2020 is 88 years. From December\
      \ 5, 1932, to May 9, 2020, that's 87 years and about 5 months, but since his\
      \ birthday is in December, he would have turned 88 in December 2019, so by May\
      \ 2020, he was 87 years and 5 months. Wait, but typically, when calculating\
      \ age at death, it's the difference in years minus one if the death date is\
      \ before the birthday. Wait, let me calculate properly. 2020 minus 1932 is 88,\
      \ but since he died in May 2020 and was born in December 1932, he hadn't turned\
      \ 88 yet. So his exact age would be 87 years, 5 months, and 4 days. So he was\
      \ 87 when he died. Hmm, that might be a point of confusion. Let me check that\
      \ again. If someone is born on 5 Dec 1932, and dies on 9 May 2020, then from\
      \ 5 Dec 1932 to 5 Dec 2019 is 87 years. Then from 5 Dec 2019 to 9 May 2020 is\
      \ another 5 months and 4 days. So he was 87 years old at death. So maybe I was\
      \ wrong earlier, thinking he was 88. So that's important. \n\nIdi Amin was 78,\
      \ Little Richard was 87. Therefore, Idi Amin was younger at the time of his\
      \ death than Little Richard. So the answer is YES. Wait, but wait, maybe I messed\
      \ up the exact ages. Let me double-check both.\n\nIdi Amin: born 1925, died\
      \ 2003. 2003 - 1925 = 78. Correct. So 78 years old.\n\nLittle Richard: 2020\
      \ - 1932 = 88, but since he died before his birthday in 2020 (December 5), he\
      \ was 87. So 87. So 87 is older than 78. Therefore, Idi Amin was younger. So\
      \ the answer is YES.\n</think>Idi Amin was born in 1925 and died in 2003, making\

      \ at his death. Comparing their ages, Idi Amin (78) was indeed younger than\
      \ Little Richard (87) at their respective times of death. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    b664edaa-b63f-430f-b966-ab9b4b12cdc9: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Idi Amin was younger when he died compared to Little Richard. Let's start\
      \ by recalling when each of them was born and when they died. \n\nFirst, Idi\
      \ Amin. I think he was a Ugandan dictator, right? From what I remember, he died\
      \ a while back. Maybe in the 2000s? Let me check my memory. Wait, I think he\
      \ died in 2003. His birth year... Hmm, wasn't he born in the late 1920s or early\
      \ 1930s? Let me think. I recall that he was in his 70s when he died. So if he\
      \ died in 2003, and let's say he was around 78, that would make his birth year\
      \ around 1925. Wait, though\u2014I might be mixing up exact numbers. Maybe he\
      \ was born in 1925, died in 2003. So 2003 minus 1925 would be 78 years old.\n\
      \nNow, Little Richard. He was a famous musician, part of the early rock and\
      \ roll era. When did he die? I think it was more recent, like 2020? Yeah, May\
      \ 2020. His birth year was 1932, if I remember correctly. So if he was born\
      \ in 1932 and died in 2020, that would make him 2020 minus 1932, which is 88\
      \ years old. \n\nWait, so comparing their ages at death: Idi Amin would be 78,\
      \ Little Richard 88. So yes, Idi Amin was younger at the time of his death.\
      \ But wait, I need to make sure my dates are correct. Let me verify the exact\
      \ birth and death years.\n\nIdi Amin: I might be off by a few years. Let me\
      \ think again. Some sources say he was born around 1925, but there's some uncertainty\
      \ because records weren't clear. Some sources suggest 1923 or 1928. Wait, according\
      \ to reliable sources, he was born in either 1923, 1925, or 1928. His exact\
      \ birth date is disputed. However, his death was on August 16, 2003. If he was\
      \ born around 1925, that would make him 78. But if he was born in 1928, he would\
      \ have been 75. Alternatively, some sources say 1923, making him 80. Hmm, this\
      \ complicates things.\n\nOn the other hand, Little Richard's birth date is more\
      \ certain. He was born on December 5, 1932, and died on May 9, 2020. So that's\
      \ definitely 2020 - 1932 = 88 years old. \n\nSo depending on Amin's actual birth\
      \ year, which is unclear, his age at death could vary. But the most commonly\
      \ cited birth year for Amin is 1925, leading to 78 years old. If that's the\
      \ case, then yes, he was younger than Little Richard. But if his birth year\
      \ was earlier, like 1923, then he'd be 80, which is still younger than 88. Wait,\
      \ 80 is still less than 88. So regardless of whether he was born in 1923, 1925,\
      \ or 1928, he would have been younger at death than Little Richard, who was\

      \ Britannica says he was born c. 1924\u201325 and died August 16, 2003. So that's\
      \ approximately 78-79 years. So yes, definitely younger than Little Richard's\
      \ 88. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>Idi Amin was born around 1925 (though\

      \ disputed birth year (even if earlier, e.g., 1923, resulting in 80 years old),\
      \ he was younger than Little Richard at their respective deaths. \n\n**ANSWER:\
      \ YES**"
    dd8aa22f-6cb6-4821-bae9-c410016acb5f: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The question is whether Idi Amin was younger at the time of\
      \ his death than Little Richard was when he died. I need to find out the birth\
      \ and death dates of both individuals, calculate their ages at death, and then\
      \ compare them.\n\nFirst, I'll start with Idi Amin. From what I remember, he\
      \ was a Ugandan dictator. I think he died in the early 2000s. Wait, wasn't he\
      \ in power during the 70s? Maybe his death was around 2003? Let me check that.\
      \ Yes, I recall that Idi Amin was born around 1925, maybe 1925 or 1928. His\
      \ death year might be 2003. If he was born in 1925 and died in 2003, that would\
      \ make him 78 years old. But I need to confirm the exact dates.\n\nNow, Little\
      \ Richard, the famous musician. He was a rock and roll pioneer. I believe he\
      \ passed away more recently, maybe 2020. His birth year was either the early\
      \ 1930s. Let me think. Little Richard was born in 1932, I think. If he died\
      \ in 2020, subtracting 1932 from 2020 gives 88 years old. So if Little Richard\
      \ was 88 when he died and Idi Amin was 78, then the answer would be yes, Amin\
      \ was younger.\n\nWait, but I need to verify the exact birth and death years\
      \ to be sure. Let me double-check. \n\nIdi Amin: According to historical records,\
      \ he was born around 1925, maybe 1925 or 1928. Some sources say 1925, others\
      \ 1928. His death was on August 16, 2003. If he was born in 1925, 2003 minus\
      \ 1925 is 78. If born in 1928, that's 75. But I think the exact birth year is\
      \ uncertain but commonly cited as 1925. So 78 years old at death.\n\nLittle\
      \ Richard's full name is Richard Wayne Penniman. He was born on December 5,\
      \ 1932, and died on May 9, 2020. So 2020 minus 1932 is 88 years old. Subtract\
      \ the dates: from December 5, 1932, to May 9, 2020. Since he was born in December,\
      \ in 2020, he would have turned 88 in December, but he died in May, so he was\
      \ 87 years old at the time of death. Wait, that's a mistake. Let me recalculate.\
      \ If he died in May 2020 before his birthday in December, then his age would\
      \ be 87 years and 5 months. So 2020 - 1932 = 88, but since he hadn't reached\
      \ his 88th birthday yet, he was 87. So maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me confirm.\
      \ December 5, 1932, to May 9, 2020: he was 87 years, 5 months, and 4 days old.\
      \ So 87 years old.\n\nWait, that complicates things. If Little Richard was 87\
      \ and Idi Amin died at 78, then the answer is yes. But if Amin's age is 75 (if\
      \ born in 1928), then also yes. However, if Little Richard was 88, then depends\
      \ on Amin's exact age. But according to the most reliable sources, Amin's birth\
      \ year is 1925, making him 78. Little Richard's correct age at death would be\
      \ 87. So 78 vs. 87: Amin was younger. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>To\

    456ea5b8-cdcc-4535-8f7e-2c84847225d9: '<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if
      Jimi Hendrix was younger when he died compared to Joseph Stalin when he died.
      Let''s break this down step by step.


      First, I should find out the birth and death years of both individuals. Let''s
      start with Jimi Hendrix. From what I remember, Hendrix was a famous guitarist
      from the 60s. He died in 1970, I think. His birth year... was he in his late
      20s when he died? Maybe born in the early 1940s. Let me check that. Oh right,
      Jimi Hendrix was born on November 27, 1942, and he died on September 18, 1970.
      So let me calculate his age at death. Subtract 1942 from 1970, which is 28 years,
      but since his birthday is in November and he died in September, he hadn''t turned
      28 yet. Wait, 1970 minus 1942 is 28, but he died in September before his November
      birthday, so he was 27 years old. Yeah, that''s right. So Hendrix was 27 when
      he died.


      Now Joseph Stalin. Stalin was the leader of the Soviet Union. When did he die?
      I think he died in the early 1950s. Maybe 1953? Yes, March 5, 1953. His birth
      year... he was born in 1878, I believe. Let me confirm. Stalin was born on December
      18, 1878. So when he died in 1953, let''s calculate his age. 1953 minus 1878
      equals 75. But again, checking the months. He was born in December and died
      in March, so he hadn''t turned 75 yet. Wait, wait. 1953 minus 1878 is actually
      75 years, but since his birthday is in December, by March 5, 1953, he would
      have been 74 years old, having not yet reached his 75th birthday. Hmm, wait,
      let me calculate that again. From December 18, 1878, to December 18, 1952, that''s
      74 years. Then from December 1952 to March 1953 is 3 months. So he was 74 years
      and about 2.5 months old when he died. So his age at death was 74 years old.


      Wait, but sometimes people might count the years directly. So 1953 - 1878 =
      75, but since his birthday hadn''t occurred yet in 1953, he was 74. So Stalin
      was 74 when he died. Hendrix was 27. So the question is: Was Hendrix younger
      at his time of death than Stalin at his? So 27 vs. 74. Yes, 27 is younger than
      74. Therefore, the answer is YES.

      </think>Jimi Hendrix was born on November 27, 1942, and died on September 18,
      1970, making him 27 years old at his death. Joseph Stalin was born on December
      18, 1878, and died on March 5, 1953, making him 74 years old at his death. Since
      27 is younger than 74, the answer is:


      YES'
    5a127b4c-5473-432c-9f26-70f250f11eea: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\

      \ And he died in 1970, September 18. So, 1970 minus 1942 would be 27 years old.\
      \ Yeah, that checks out. So he was 27 when he died.\n\nNow Joseph Stalin. He\
      \ was the leader of the Soviet Union. I think he lived a longer life. Stalin\
      \ was born in 1878, December 18. And he died in 1953, March 5. Let's calculate\
      \ his age. 1953 minus 1878 is 75 years. But wait, since his birthday is in December,\
      \ when he died in March, he was still 74 years old, right? Because he hadn't\

      \ Let's count: 1953 - 1878 = 75, but since he died before his birthday in 1953,\
      \ he was 74 years old. Wait, no. Wait, 1953 minus 1878. Let's do the math step\
      \ by step. 1878 + 75 = 1953. So if he was born in December 1878, then on December\
      \ 18, 1952, he would have been 74, and December 18, 1953 would be 75. But he\

      \ the standard way to calculate age is to subtract the birth year from the death\

      \ is in December, he hadn't turned 75 yet. So he was 74 at death. So that's\
      \ 74 years old.\n\nSo Jimi Hendrix was 27, Stalin was 74. So yes, Hendrix was\
      \ younger when he died than Stalin was when he died. Therefore, the answer is\
      \ YES.\n</think>Jimi Hendrix died at age 27, while Joseph Stalin died at age\
      \ 74. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    71594272-2159-4cec-8ee7-58dddbc8015e: '<think>Okay, let me try to figure this
      out. The question is whether Jimi Hendrix was younger when he died than Joseph
      Stalin was when he died. I need to check their birth and death years and then
      calculate their ages at the time of death.


      First, I''ll start with Jimi Hendrix. From what I remember, he was a famous
      rock guitarist in the 1960s. I think he died in 1970, maybe? His birth year...
      I want to say he was born in the early ''40s. Let me recall. Oh, right, Jimi
      Hendrix was born on November 27, 1942. He died on September 18, 1970. So to
      find his age at death, I subtract 1942 from 1970. That would be 1970 - 1942
      = 28 years old. But wait, since his birthday is in November and he died in September,
      he hadn''t turned 28 yet that year. Wait, no, 1970 minus 1942 is 28. Wait, November
      27, 1942 to November 27, 1970 is exactly 28 years. But he died in September
      1970, so he was 27 years old, and would have turned 28 in November. So his age
      at death was 27 years. I need to confirm that. Let me calculate: from 1942 to
      1970 is 28 years, but since he died before his birthday in 1970, he was 27 years
      old. Yes, that''s right. So Hendrix was 27 when he died.


      Next, Joseph Stalin. He was the leader of the Soviet Union. His death was in
      1953, I believe. His birth year is older. I think he was born in 1878 or around
      there. Let me check. Joseph Stalin''s birth date is December 18, 1878. He died
      on March 5, 1953. So to calculate his age at death: 1953 - 1878. Let''s subtract:
      1953 minus 1878. 1878 + 75 = 1953. So 75 years old? Wait, 1953 - 1878 = 75?
      Let me do the math step by step. 1953 minus 1800 is 153. 1878 is 78 years into
      the 1800s. So 153 - 78 = 75. Yes, so 75 years old. But wait, his birthday is
      in December. He died in March 1953, so he had already turned 74 in December
      1952, and died in March at 74 years old? Wait, no. Let me recalculate. From
      December 18, 1878, to December 18, 1952, that''s 74 years. Then, from December
      1952 to March 1953 is 3 months. So since he died on March 5, 1953, before his
      75th birthday in December 1953? Wait, no. Wait, his birthday is December 18.
      So in 1953, he would turn 75 on December 18, 1953. But he died in March 1953,
      so he was 74 years old at the time of death, right? Wait, no, wait: 1953 minus
      1878 is 75. But if he was born in 1878, then in 1953, he would be 75 years old
      only if he had already had his birthday that year. Since he died in March 1953,
      months before his December birthday, his age was 74 years and a few months.
      So the calculation would be 1953 - 1878 - 1 = 74 years old. Because he hadn''t
      reached his 75th birthday yet. Wait, but how do you properly calculate age?
      Let''s see:


      Stalin was born in 1878-12-18, died 1953-03-05.


      So from 1878-12-18 to 1952-12-18: 74 years.


      From 1952-12-18 to 1953-03-05: 2 months and 17 days (December 18 to March 5:
      December has 13 days left after the 18th, then January (31), February (28 in
      1953?), March 5. Total: 13 + 31 + 28 +5= 77 days. So 74 years and 77 days. So
      his age was 74 years old. But sometimes people might round up if the person
      is in the year of their 75th birthday? No, typically, your age is the number
      of full years you''ve completed. So Stalin would have been 74 years old at death.
      Wait, but 1953 minus 1878 is 75. But since his birthday was in December, he
      hadn''t turned 75 yet. So the correct age is 74.


      Wait, I''m getting conflicting numbers here. Let me use a calculator approach.
      Birth year: 1878. Death year:1953. The difference is 75 years. But if the death
      occurred before the birthday, subtract one. So 75 -1 =74. So yes, Stalin was
      74 years old when he died.


      But now I need to check a reliable source. Wait, I think some sources say Stalin
      was 74 when he died. Let me confirm. For example, if he was born in 1878 and
      died in 1953, that''s 75 years, but since he hadn''t had his birthday in 1953
      yet, he was 74. So 74 years old.


      So Hendrix was 27, Stalin was 74. Therefore, Hendrix was younger at the time
      of death than Stalin. So the answer is YES, Jimi Hendrix was younger when he
      died than Joseph Stalin.

      </think>Jimi Hendrix was born on November 27, 1942, and died on September 18,
      1970. Calculating his age at death: He was 27 years old (as he died before his
      28th birthday in November 1970). Joseph Stalin was born on December 18, 1878,
      and died on March 5, 1953. His age at death was 74 years (since he died before
      his 75th birthday in December 1953). Since 27 is younger than 74, the answer
      is YES.

      \ was born in 1878, I believe. Let me verify: Stalin was born December 18, 1878,\
      \ and died March 5, 1953. So calculating his age: 1953 minus 1878 is 75 years.\
      \ But since his birthday is in December, he hadn't turned 75 yet when he died\
      \ in March. So he was 74 years old at death. Wait, 1953 - 1878: 1953 minus 1800\
      \ is 153, minus 78 is 75. Wait, but December to March: he was born in December\
      \ 1878, so by December 1952 he would have been 74, and died in March 1953, so\
      \ he was 74 years and about 3 months old. So his age would be 74 years old.\
      \ Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's do exact calculation: from December\
      \ 18, 1878 to March December December December December December 18, 1878 to\
      \ December 18, 1952 is exactly 74 years. Then from December 18, 1952 to March\
      \ 5, 1953 is 2 months and 17 days. So total age is 74 years, 2 months, 17 days.\
      \ So he was 74 years old at death. Wait, but sometimes people count the completed\
      \ years. So if someone is 74 years and 2 months, they are still considered 74.\
      \ So Stalin was 74 when he died. \n\nSo Hendrix was 27, Stalin was 74. Therefore,\

      \ lived 74 years and about 2.5 months). Since 27 is less than 74, **YES**, Hendrix\
      \ was younger at his time of death than Stalin. \n\n**ANSWER: YES**"
    b7586d89-4575-4046-8d6a-9f389d0fd1fd: '<think>Okay, let me try to figure this
      out. So the question is whether Jimi Hendrix was younger when he died than Joseph
      Stalin was when he died. I need to find the ages of both at their respective
      times of death and compare them.


      First, I should recall when each of them died and their birth years. Let''s
      start with Jimi Hendrix. I know he was a famous guitarist from the 1960s. From
      what I remember, he died in 1970, I think. His birth year was 1942. Wait, if
      he was born in 1942 and died in 1970, that would make him 27 years old. Oh right,
      he''s part of the "27 Club," which includes musicians who died at age 27. So
      that''s 1970 minus 1942, which is 28 years, but since his birthday is in November
      and he died in September, he would have been 27, not 28. So Jimi Hendrix was
      27 when he died.


      Now, Joseph Stalin. He was the leader of the Soviet Union. When did he die?
      I think he died in the 1950s. Let me check my memory. Stalin''s death was in
      1953, March 5th. His birth year was 1878. So if he was born in 1878 and died
      in 1953, let''s calculate that. Subtract 1878 from 1953. 1953 minus 1878...
      that''s 75 years. Wait, 1953 - 1878: 1878 + 75 = 1953. Yes, so Stalin was 75
      years old when he died.


      So comparing the two: Hendrix was 27, Stalin was 75. Therefore, yes, Jimi Hendrix
      was younger at the time of his death than Joseph Stalin was when he died. The
      answer should be YES.

      </think>Jimi Hendrix was born on November 27, 1942, and died on September 18,
      1970, making him 27 years old at his death. Joseph Stalin was born on December
      18, 1878, and died on March 5, 1953, making him 74 years old (turning 75 later
      that year). Since 27 is younger than 74, the answer is YES.


      **ANSWER: YES**'
    c181bb92-2cbc-4207-9379-d1787008ee0a: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\

      \ in the early 70s. Let me check in my mind. He was part of the 27 Club, so\
      \ he died at 27. That's a common fact. So Hendrix was born in 1942, maybe? If\
      \ he died at 27 in 1970, then yes, 1970 minus 27 would be 1943, but wait, I\
      \ might be mixing up the exact years. Let me think again. Hendrix died in 1970,\
      \ and he was born on November 27, 1942. So from 1942 to 1970 is 28 years, but\
      \ he died in September 1970, so he was 27 years old, just a few months short\

      \ is in December, and he died in March, he was 74 years old at the time of death,\
      \ right? Wait, 1953 minus 1878 is 75, but since he hadn't reached his birthday\
      \ in 1953 yet, he would be 74. Wait, no. Let's do the exact calculation. From\
      \ December 18, 1878, to December 18, 1952, that's 74 years. Then from December\
      \ 18, 1952, to March 5, 1953, he's 74 years old, and dies at 74 years and a\
      \ few months. So he was 74 when he died. Wait, but some sources might say 75.\
      \ Maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, maybe the calculation is 1953\

      \ 74. Since he died in March and his birthday is in December, he was still 74.\
      \ So depending on the source, but I think the correct age is 74. However, sometimes\

      \ The exact date... Oh, yeah, he passed away in September 1970. So if he was\
      \ born in 1942, subtracting that from 1970 would give his age. 1970 minus 1942\

      \ birth year. Maybe it's 1879? Let me confirm. I recall that there's sometimes\

      \ be December 30, 1878, in the Gregorian. But some sources might list it as\
      \ 1879? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again. Commonly, Stalin's\
      \ birth year is cited as 1878. So 1953 minus 1878 is 75. Therefore, he was 74\
      \ years old (if counted by exact date) or 75? His birthday is December 18 (old\
      \ style) so in 1953, if his birthday was in December and he died in March 1953,\
      \ then he would have been 74 years old because he hadn't reached his birthday\
      \ that year. Wait, when exactly did Stalin die? He died on March 5, 1953. His\
      \ birthday is December 18, 1878. So from December 18, 1878, to March 5, 1953.\
      \ Let's calculate his age. 1953 - 1878 = 75, but since he died before his birthday\
      \ in 1953, he was 74 years and about 2.5 months old. So he was 74 at the time\
      \ of death. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe the exact age is 74 years, 2 months,\
      \ and some days. But sometimes, in terms of completed years, he would be 74.\
      \ But some sources might round up. However, the key here is whether Hendrix's\

      So, the question is asking whether Ferdinand Magellan was younger at the time
      of his death than Ella Fitzgerald was when she died. Hmm, I need to figure out
      their birth years and death years, calculate their ages, and then compare them.


      First, Ferdinand Magellan. I remember he was a Portuguese explorer known for
      the first circumnavigation of the Earth. Wait, but actually, didn''t he die
      during that voyage? I think he was killed in the Philippines. As for his birth
      year, I''m a bit fuzzy. Maybe around the late 1400s? Let me check in my mind.
      Magellan''s expedition started in 1519, and he died in 1521 during the Battle
      of Mactan. If I recall correctly, he was born around 1480. So if he died in
      1521, subtracting 1480 gives him about 40-41 years old. But wait, I should confirm
      the exact dates. I think his birth is estimated around 1480, and he died in
      1521. So 1521 minus 1480 is 41. So approximately 41 years old at death.


      Ella Fitzgerald, the jazz singer. She was a 20th-century figure. I believe she
      lived a long life. Let''s see, she was born in 1917 and died in 1996. So if
      she died in 1996, subtracting 1917 from 1996 gives 79 years old. Wait, 1996
      minus 1917: 1917 + 79 = 1996. Correct. So she was 79 when she died.


      Comparing the two: Magellan was about 41, Ella Fitzgerald was 79. So the question
      is, was Magellan younger when he died than Ella when she died? Yes, 41 is younger
      than 79. Therefore, the answer should be YES.


      But wait, let me double-check the birth and death years for Magellan. Some sources
      might say 1480-1521. So that''s 41 years. And Ella Fitzgerald 1917-1996, 79
      years. Definitely, 41 is younger. So the answer is YES.

    525cf948-c5c3-4ce2-a41b-b0223d5bcc75: '<think>Alright, let''s tackle this question.
      So, the question is whether Ferdinand Magellan was younger at the time of his
      death than Ella Fitzgerald was at hers. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure out
      the birth and death years of both individuals and then calculate their ages
      at death.


      Starting with Ferdinand Magellan. I remember he was a Portuguese explorer known
      for the first circumnavigation of the Earth, although he actually died before
      the voyage was completed. Let me recall his dates. I think he was born around
      1480. His death was during the expedition, which was in the early 16th century.
      The exact year of his death... I believe he died in 1521 during a battle in
      the Philippines. So if he was born in 1480 and died in 1521, that would make
      him 41 years old at death. Wait, but I should double-check those dates to be
      sure. Let me confirm: Magellan''s birth is often cited as 1480, and he died
      in April 1521. So 1521 minus 1480 is indeed 41 years old.


      Now, Ella Fitzgerald. She was a famous jazz singer, right? I know she lived
      a long life. Let me think. She was born in 1917, I believe, and died in 1996.
      So if she was born in 1917 and died in 1996, that would make her 79 years old
      at the time of her death. Let me verify that. Yes, Ella Fitzgerald was born
      on April 25, 1917, and died on June 15, 1996. Subtracting 1917 from 1996 gives
      79 years. She was 79 when she passed away.


      So comparing the two: Magellan was 41, and Ella Fitzgerald was 79. Therefore,
      Magellan was indeed younger at the time of his death than Ella Fitzgerald was
      at hers. The answer should be YES.

      </think>Ferdinand Magellan was born in 1480 and died in 1521 at age 41. Ella
      Fitzgerald was born in 1917 and died in 1996 at age 79. Since 41 is younger
      than 79, the answer is YES.


      **ANSWER: YES**'

      \ Ferdinand Magellan was younger when he died than Ella Fitzgerald. Hmm, I need\

      \ \n\nFirst, let's start with Ferdinand Magellan. I remember he was a Portuguese\
      \ explorer famous for the expedition that resulted in the first circumnavigation\
      \ of the Earth. Now, when did he die? I think he died during that voyage. The\
      \ expedition started around 1519, and he was killed in the Philippines in 1521\
      \ during a battle with local tribes. So, he didn't complete the entire journey;\

      \ Yes, if he died in 1521, and he was born in 1480, that would make him about\
      \ 40-41 years old when he died. Wait, 1521 minus 1480 is 41 years. So Magellan\

      \ and he died in 1521. If he was around 40 when he died, that would put his\

      \ or 45, still way younger than Hitchcock's 81. So regardless, the answer remains\
      \ YES. Hitchcock lived much longer.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\
      \  \n1. **Francis of Assisi**: Born in 1181/1182, died in 1226. Age at death\
      \ = 1226 - 1181 = 45 (or 44 if born in 1182).  \n2. **Alfred Hitchcock**: Born\

    46102f0c-ff1b-4726-8866-eeb78ba277f0: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the question is whether Francis of Assisi was younger when he died compared\
      \ to Alfred Hitchcock when he died. I need to figure out their ages at death\
      \ and see which one was younger.\n\nFirst, I should recall who these people\
      \ are. Francis of Assisi is a Catholic saint, known for founding the Franciscan\
      \ order. He lived in the medieval period. Alfred Hitchcock was a famous film\
      \ director from the 20th century, known for movies like Psycho and The Birds.\
      \ \n\nNow, I need their birth and death years. Let's start with Francis of Assisi.\
      \ I think he was born around 1181 or 1182. Let me check... Yes, he was born\
      \ in 1181 or 1182. His death year is 1226. So to calculate his age, subtract\
      \ 1181 from 1226. That would be 45 years old. Wait, if he was born in 1181,\
      \ then 1226 minus 1181 is 45. If he was born in 1182, it would be 44. But I\
      \ think the exact birth year might be uncertain, but generally, he's said to\
      \ have died at 44 or 45. Let's go with 44 for safety, but maybe I should verify\
      \ that later.\n\nNext, Alfred Hitchcock. He was born in 1899 and died in 1980.\
      \ So 1980 minus 1899 is 81 years old. So Hitchcock was 81 when he died. \n\n\
      Comparing the two: Francis was around 44-45, Hitchcock was 81. So yes, Francis\
      \ was younger at the time of his death. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\
      \ But wait, let me make sure I have the dates right. For Francis of Assisi,\
      \ birth is 1181 or 1182, death October 3, 1226. So if he was born in 1181, he\
      \ would be 45. If 1182, 44. Let's say 44. Either way, 44 or 45 is much younger\
      \ than 81. So the answer is definitely YES. Francis died younger than Hitchcock.\n\
      </think>YES. Francis of Assisi died at approximately 44\u201345 years old (born\
      \ 1181/1182, died 1226), while Alfred Hitchcock died at 81 (born 1899, died\
      \ 1980). Thus, Francis was younger at his time of death. \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    650f8bd9-b5fe-49fc-aa5d-fb71b7de560b: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ asking whether Francis of Assisi was younger when he died compared to Alfred\
      \ Hitchcock when he died. I need to figure out the ages at death of both individuals\
      \ and then compare them. \n\nFirst, I should recall some basic information about\
      \ these two historical figures. Francis of Assisi is a well-known Catholic saint,\
      \ founder of the Franciscan Order. I think he lived during the medieval period.\
      \ Alfred Hitchcock was a famous film director from the 20th century, known for\
      \ his suspense and thriller movies.\n\nStarting with Francis of Assisi: I remember\
      \ he was born around 1181 or 1182. His death year, if I'm not mistaken, was\
      \ 1226. So to calculate his age, subtract his birth year from his death year.\
      \ Let's do that: 1226 minus 1181. That would make him 45 years old when he died,\
      \ if the birth year is 1181. If it's 1182, then 1226 - 1182 = 44. Wait, sometimes\
      \ exact birth dates can be a bit fuzzy for medieval figures, but I think the\
      \ common consensus is that he was born in 1181 or 1182 and died in 1226, so\
      \ his age would be either 44 or 45. I'll check that again later.\n\nNow, Alfred\
      \ Hitchcock: He was a more modern figure. I believe he was born in 1899 and\
      \ died in 1980. So subtracting 1899 from 1980 gives 81 years. So Hitchcock was\
      \ 81 when he died. \n\nComparing the two, Francis of Assisi was in his mid-40s,\
      \ while Hitchcock was in his early 80s. So yes, Francis was definitely younger\
      \ at the time of his death than Hitchcock. \n\nBut wait, I need to make sure\
      \ I have the dates right. Let me confirm. \n\nFor Francis of Assisi: Quick check\u2014\
      he was born in 1181 or 1182. Died October 3, 1226. So if he was born in 1181,\
      \ 1226 - 1181 = 45. If born in 1182, it's 44. Some sources might differ, but\
      \ the exact age might be around there. For example, if his birth was in 1181\
      \ but he died before his birthday in 1226, he would still be 44. But commonly,\
      \ he's said to have died at 44 or 45. Either way, that's way younger than Hitchcock's\
      \ 81.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock: Born August 13, 1899, died April 29, 1980. Let's\
      \ compute his exact age. From August 13, 1899 to April 29, 1980. So he was 80\
      \ years and about 8 months old. Wait, that's not 81. Wait, 1980 minus 1899 is\
      \ 81 years, but since his birthday is in August and he died in April, he hadn't\
      \ yet reached his 81st birthday. So he was 80 years old at death. Hmm, that's\
      \ a mistake in my initial calculation. So Hitchcock was 80 when he died, not\
      \ 81. But even if he was 80, Francis was still much younger. \n\nBut wait, let's\
      \ recalculate: 1980 minus 1899. Let's do 1980 - 1900 = 80, and 1900 - 1899 =\
      \ 1, so total 81. But because he died before his birthday in 1980, he was actually\
      \ 80 years and 8 months old. So his age at death was 80. So depending on how\
      \ precise we are, but generally, sources might list his age as 80. Wait, I need\
      \ to check: August 13, 1899 to April 29, 1980. The exact age calculation would\
      \ be 1980 - 1899 = 81 years, but subtract one year because he hadn't reached\
      \ his birthday in 1980. So 80 years, 8 months, and 16 days. Therefore, 80 years\
      \ old. That's a common mistake, because subtraction gives 81, but actual age\
      \ is 80. However, some sources might round up or state 80. So if Hitchcock was\
      \ 80 and Francis was 44 or 45, then the answer is still yes, Francis was younger.\n\
      \nSo the answer would be YES, Francis of Assisi was younger at his time of death\

      First, Francis of Assisi. I remember he's a saint from the Middle Ages. If I\

      \ he died in 1226. So let's check that. If he was born in 1181 and died in 1226,\

      \ He was a 20th-century figure. I believe he was born in 1899 and died in 1980.\
      \ Let me confirm. Yes, Alfred Hitchcock was born on August 13, 1899, and died\
      \ on April 29, 1980. To find his age at death, subtract 1899 from 1980. But\
      \ wait, he was born in August and died in April, so he hadn't reached his birthday\
      \ in 1980 yet. So 1980 - 1899 = 81 years, but since his birthday was in August\
      \ and he died in April, he was 80 years old at the time of death. Wait, no,\
      \ 1980 minus 1899 is 81, but since he died before his birthday, he was 80 years\
      \ and about 8 months old. So his age would be 80 years old. Wait, but sometimes\
      \ when calculating ages, if the person hasn't had their birthday yet in the\
      \ year of death, you subtract one year. So 1980 - 1899 = 81, but since he died\

      \ 24 gives 1939. So Oswald was born in 1939 and died in 1963, making him 24\
      \ years old.\n\nNow, Hans Christian Andersen. He's the famous Danish author,\

      out. The question is whether Lee Harvey Oswald was younger when he died than
      Hans Christian Andersen was when he died. Hmm, I need to compare their ages
      at the time of their deaths.


      First, I should find out when each of them was born and when they died. Let''s
      start with Lee Harvey Oswald. I remember that he was involved in the assassination
      of President John F. Kennedy in 1963. I think he was killed shortly after that,
      maybe in the same year or the next. Let me check the dates. Oswald was born
      in October 1939, and he died in November 1963. So, his age at death would be
      24 years old, right? Because from October 1939 to October 1963 is 24 years,
      and then he died in November, so maybe just a month into being 24. So yeah,
      around 24 years old.


      Now, Hans Christian Andersen. He''s the famous Danish author of fairy tales,
      like "The Little Mermaid" and "The Ugly Duckling." I need his birth and death
      years. I''m pretty sure he lived in the 19th century. Let me recall. I think
      he was born in 1805 and died in 1875. So, if he was born in 1805 and died in
      1875, that would make him 70 years old at the time of his death. Wait, 1875
      minus 1805 is indeed 70 years. So, he was 70 when he died.


      Comparing the two: Oswald was 24, Andersen was 70. So, yes, Oswald was younger
      at his time of death than Andersen. Therefore, the answer should be YES.

      </think>YES. Lee Harvey Oswald was born in October 1939 and died in November

      \ Wait, no, that might not add up. Let me check mentally. If he was 24 in 1963,\

      \ actually, I recall that Oswald was 24 when he died. So if he died in 1963,\

      \ So, the question is whether Ho Chi Minh was younger at his time of death than\
      \ Rosa Parks at her time of death. I need to figure out their birth years and\
      \ death years, then calculate their ages at death and compare them. \n\nFirst,\
      \ Ho Chi Minh. I remember he was a Vietnamese communist leader, right? The one\
      \ involved in the Vietnam War. I think he died during the war. Let me recall...\
      \ I believe he passed away in 1969. As for his birth year, wasn't he born in\
      \ 1890? Or was it 1890? Wait, I'm pretty sure it's 1890. So if he died in 1969,\
      \ subtract 1890 from 1969. That would make him 79 years old when he died. Wait,\
      \ 1969 minus 1890... Let me check that math. 1969 - 1890. Let's subtract: 1900\
      \ from 1890 is 10 years, so 1969 is 69 years after 1900. So 10 + 69 equals 79.\
      \ Yeah, that's right. So Ho Chi Minh was 79 when he died.\n\nNow, Rosa Parks.\

      \ When did she die? I think she lived a long life. I recall her death was in\
      \ 2005. Her birth year... she was born in 1913, if I'm not mistaken. So 2005\

      \ in the 1950s? And she was born in the early 20th century. Let me confirm.\
      \ Frida Kahlo was born on July 6, 1907. Her death... I believe she died in 1954.\

      \ So if he was born in 1881 and died in 1973, that would make him 91 or 92 years\
      \ old. Let me calculate the exact age: 1973 minus 1881 is 92 years. So he was\
      \ 91 years old when he died? Wait, actually, if his birthday had passed in 1973\
      \ before his death, then he would have been 92. But if he died before his birthday,\
      \ he'd still be 91. Let me check the exact date. Oh, right, Picasso was born\

      Alright, Frida Kahlo. I remember she was a Mexican artist, married to Diego\
      \ Rivera. I think she died relatively young. Let me recall... She was born in\
      \ 1907. Her death year, I think she passed away in the 1950s. Maybe 1954? So\

      \ I didn't mix up anything.\n\nFrida Kahlo: born July 6, 1907, died July 13,\
      \ 1954. That's 47 years and 7 days. Correct. Picasso: October 25, 1881 \u2013\
      \ April 8, 1973. Calculating his age: 1973 minus 1881 is 92. Since he died in\
      \ April, before his birthday in October, he would have been 91 years and about\
      \ 5 months. Wait, but 1973 minus 1881 is 92 years. Wait, 1881 + 92 = 1973. So\
      \ if his birthday was in October, and he died in April, he hadn't turned 92\
      \ yet. Wait, no. From October 25, 1881, to October 25, 1973, would be exactly\
      \ 92 years. But he died on April 8, 1973, which is 6 months before his 92nd\
      \ birthday. So he was 91 years old at death. Oh, so my initial calculation was\
      \ wrong. Let me recalculate. 1973 minus 1881 equals 92, but because he died\
      \ before his birthday, he was 91. So 91 years old. \n\nSo Frida was 47, Picasso\
      \ was 91. So 47 is still younger than 91. So the answer remains YES. But I need\
      \ to make sure. So Frida's age at death: 1954 - 1907 = 47. But if her birthday\
      \ was in July, and she died in July, then she turned 47 that year. So exact\
      \ age would be 47. Picasso: 1973 - 1881 = 92, but since he died in April before\

    c4b94193-f335-41b8-95f6-da856a4a09a0: '<think>Okay, let me figure this out. The
      question is whether Frida Kahlo was younger when she died compared to Pablo
      Picasso at the time of his death.


      First, I need to recall their birth and death years. Let''s start with Frida
      Kahlo. I remember she was a Mexican artist, and I think she died relatively
      young. Wasn''t she in her 40s? Let me check the dates. I believe she was born
      in 1907. Her death year... I think she died in the 1950s. Maybe 1954? So if
      she was born in 1907 and died in 1954, that would make her 47 years old.


      Now, Pablo Picasso. He''s one of the most famous artists, right? He lived a
      long life. I''m pretty sure he was born in 1881. His death year is later, maybe
      in the 1970s. Let me see... I think he died in 1973. So if he was born in 1881
      and died in 1973, subtract 1881 from 1973. That would be 92 years old.


      Wait, so Frida was 47 and Picasso was 92. So yes, Frida was younger at the time
      of her death. But wait, let me confirm the exact dates again to be sure. Sometimes
      I mix up dates. Frida Kahlo: born July 6, 1907, died July 13, 1954. That''s
      47 years and 7 days old. Picasso: born October 25, 1881, died April 8, 1973.
      Let''s calculate his age. 1973 minus 1881 is 92 years. But since his birthday
      is in October and he died in April, he hadn''t turned 92 yet. Wait, from October
      25, 1881, to October 25, 1972, he would be 91. Then from October 25, 1972, to
      April 8, 1973, that''s 5 months and 13 days. So he was 91 years old when he
      died, right? Wait, no. Wait, 1973 minus 1881 is 92 years. But if his birthday
      is after the death date, then he would be 91. Let''s do the exact calculation.
      From October 25, 1881, to April 8, 1973. So from 1881 to 1973 is 92 years, but
      since he died in April before his October birthday, he was 91 years and about
      5 months old. So his age at death would be 91 years. Hmm, maybe I should double-check.
      Let''s see: 1973 - 1881 = 92, but if you subtract the dates: 1973-04-08 minus
      1881-10-25. Let''s count the years. From 1881 to 1972 is 91 years. Then from
      October 25, 1972, to April 8, 1973, that''s 5 months and 14 days. So total age
      is 91 years, 5 months, and 14 days. So he was 91 years old. Wait, but some sources
      might round up. I think most sources list Picasso''s age at death as 91. So
      Frida was 47, Picasso 91. So yes, Frida was younger when she died. Therefore,
      the answer is YES.

      </think>Frida Kahlo was born in 1907 and died in 1954 at age 47. Pablo Picasso
      was born in 1881 and died in 1973, living to age 91. Since 47 is younger than
      91, the answer is YES.

    e0e0c0b9-9a85-4ea4-bf97-e896ea56c627: '<think>Okay, let''s tackle this question
      step by step. The question is whether Frida Kahlo was younger when she died
      compared to Pablo Picasso at the time of his death. So, I need to find out both
      of their death ages and compare them.


      First, I should recall their birth and death years. Frida Kahlo was a Mexican
      painter known for her self-portraits. I remember she had a difficult life with
      health issues. I think she died relatively young. Maybe in the 1950s? Wait,
      I''m not sure. Let me think. She was married to Diego Rivera, right? And she
      was involved in a bus accident when she was young. Her death... I think she
      died in 1954. But how old was she? If she was born in 1907, then 1954 minus
      1907 would be 47 years old. Wait, was she born in 1907? I might be mixing up
      dates. Let me verify that. Yes, Frida Kahlo was born on July 6, 1907, and died
      on July 13, 1954. So that''s 47 years old at death.


      Now, Pablo Picasso. He was a Spanish artist, lived a long life. I think he died
      in the 1970s. He was born in 1881, maybe? Let me check. If he was born in 1881
      and died in 1973, that would make him 91 years old. Yes, Picasso was born on
      October 25, 1881, and died on April 8, 1973. So 91 years old when he died.


      Comparing the two: Frida Kahlo was 47, Picasso was 91. So yes, Kahlo was younger
      at the time of her death. But wait, the question is phrased as "younger at their
      time of death than Pablo Picasso at their time of death." So, since 47 is less
      than 91, the answer should be yes. But let me just confirm the dates again to
      make sure I didn''t mix up anything. Frida Kahlo: 1907-1954 (47), Picasso: 1881-1973
      (91). Yep, that''s correct. So the answer is YES.

      </think>Frida Kahlo was born in 1907 and died in 1954 at age 47. Pablo Picasso
      was born in 1881 and died in 1973 at age 91. Since 47 (Kahlo) is younger than
      91 (Picasso), the answer is YES.

      \nYES, Frida Kahlo was younger at her time of death than Pablo Picasso."
    fba80ea6-2201-4939-b31b-0c33d474bc59: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Frida Kahlo was younger when she died compared to Pablo Picasso when\
      \ he died. I need to figure out their ages at the time of their deaths and then\
      \ compare them.\n\nFirst, I should recall when each artist was born and when\
      \ they died. Let me start with Frida Kahlo. If I remember correctly, Frida Kahlo\
      \ was a Mexican painter known for her self-portraits. I think she was born in\
      \ 1907. Her death... I'm pretty sure she died relatively young. Wasn't it in\
      \ the 1950s? Maybe 1954? Let me verify that. Yes, Frida Kahlo was born on July\
      \ 6, 1907, and died on July 13, 1954. So, calculating her age: 1954 minus 1907\
      \ equals 47 years old. But wait, she was born in July and died in July, so she\
      \ had just turned 47 a week before her death, so she was 47 years old at death.\n\
      \nNow, Pablo Picasso. He's one of the most famous artists of the 20th century.\
      \ I think he lived a long life. Born in 1881, right? And died in the 1970s.\
      \ Let me check. Pablo Picasso was born on October 25, 1881, and died on April\
      \ 8, 1973. So his age at death would be 1973 minus 1881. Let's do the math:\
      \ 1973 - 1881 = 92 years. But wait, since his birthday is in October and he\
      \ died in April, he hadn't turned 92 yet in 1973. Wait, 1973 minus 1881 is 92\
      \ years, but because he died in April, which is before his October birthday,\
      \ he was actually 91 years old. Wait, let's calculate it properly. From October\
      \ 25, 1881, to October 25, 1972, that's 91 years. Then from October 25, 1972,\
      \ to April 8, 1973, is about 5 months and 13 days. So he was 91 years old at\
      \ the time of his death, not 92. Hmm, but sometimes people might round up. Wait,\
      \ no, because he didn't reach his 92nd birthday. So his exact age would be 91\
      \ years, 5 months, and 13 days. So, 91 years old.\n\nSo Frida Kahlo was 47,\
      \ and Picasso was 91 when they died. Therefore, yes, Frida was younger at the\
      \ time of her death than Picasso was at his. So the answer is YES.\n</think>Frida\
      \ Kahlo was born on July 6, 1907, and died on July 13, 1954, making her 47 years\

      \ 8, 1973. Calculating his age: 1973 - 1881 = 92, but since he died before his\
      \ October birthday, his exact age was 91 years, 5 months. \n\nYES, Frida Kahlo\
      \ was younger at her death than Picasso was at his."

    4cf1622f-6a02-4f78-81a9-6a7594656f87: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. So, the question is asking whether Fyodor Dostoyevsky was younger\
      \ at the time of his death than Hank Aaron was when he died. The answer needs\
      \ to be a simple YES or NO, but I need to figure it out by checking their birth\
      \ and death years first.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the lifespan of Fyodor Dostoyevsky.\
      \ From what I remember, he was a 19th-century Russian novelist. I think he was\
      \ born in 1821 and died in 1881. Let me verify that... Yeah, Dostoyevsky was\
      \ born on November 11, 1821, and died on February 9, 1881. So to calculate his\
      \ age at death, I subtract 1821 from 1881. That gives 60 years. But wait, his\
      \ birthday is in November and he died in February, so he hadn't turned 61 yet.\
      \ So he was 59 years old when he died? Wait, no, let me do the math again. 1881\
      \ minus 1821 is 60, but if his birthday is in November and he died in February,\
      \ he would have been 59 years and a few months. Hmm, but usually, when calculating\
      \ age, you subtract the birth year from the death year and then adjust if they\
      \ hadn't had their birthday yet. So 1881 - 1821 = 60, but since he died before\
      \ his birthday in November, he was 59 years old. Wait, no, 1881 minus 1821 is\
      \ 60, but if he died in February 1821? Wait, no, his birth year is 1821, death\
      \ year 1881. So from November 1821 to November 1881 would be 60 years. But he\
      \ died in February 1881, which is 9 months before his 60th birthday. So his\
      \ age at death was 59 years, 3 months (approx). So he was 59 when he died.\n\
      \nNow, Hank Aaron. He's a more recent figure. Hank Aaron was a baseball player,\
      \ right? I think he died recently. Let me think... Hank Aaron was born in 1934\
      \ and died in 2021. So, from 1934 to 2021 is 87 years. But wait, I need his\
      \ exact birth and death dates. Hank Aaron was born on February 5, 1934, and\
      \ died on January 22, 2021. So, he died just a couple of weeks before his 87th\
      \ birthday. So his age at death would be 86 years. Because he hadn't reached\
      \ February 5, 2021, when he died on January 22, so 86 years old.\n\nWait, let\
      \ me double-check. 2021 minus 1934 equals 87, but since he died before his birthday,\
      \ it's 86 years. So Hank Aaron was 86 when he died. Dostoyevsky was 59. So 59\
      \ is younger than 86. Therefore, YES, Dostoyevsky was younger at the time of\
      \ his death than Hank Aaron.\n\nWait, let me confirm the birth and death dates\
      \ again. Dostoyevsky: 1821-1881. 1881-1821=60, but since he died in February,\
      \ his birthday in November would mean he was 59. Hank Aaron: 1934-2021. 2021-1934=87,\
      \ but he died in January, so 86. So Dostoyevsky (59) vs. Hank Aaron (86). So\
      \ YES, Dostoyevsky was younger. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine\
      \ if Fyodor Dostoyevsky was younger at his death than Hank Aaron:  \n- **Dostoyevsky**\
      \ was born on November 11, 1821, and died on February 9, 1881. Calculating his\
      \ age:  \n  - 1881 \u2212 1821 = 60 years, but he died **9 months before his\
      \ 60th birthday**, making him **59 years old** at death.  \n- **Hank Aaron**\
      \ was born on February 5, 1934, and died on January 22, 2021.  \n  - 2021 \u2212\
      \ 1934 = 87 years, but he died **13 days before his 87th birthday**, making\
      \ him **86 years old** at death.  \n\nSince 59 < 86, the answer is **YES**.\
      \  \n\nANSWER: YES"
    606a1b93-cf64-4691-a77a-7ad41b595c51: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\

      \ when each of them was born and when they died. Then subtract the birth year\
      \ from the death year to get their age. Wait, but also check the exact dates\
      \ because sometimes the birth and death dates are in the same year but different\
      \ months, which affects the age.\n\nStarting with Fyodor Dostoyevsky. I remember\
      \ he was a Russian novelist, wrote books like Crime and Punishment. Let me recall\
      \ his lifespan. I think he was born in 1821 and died in 1881. Wait, maybe? Let\
      \ me check in my mind. Yes, Dostoyevsky was born on November 11, 1821, and died\
      \ on February 9, 1881. So to calculate his age at death: 1881 minus 1821 is\
      \ 60 years. But wait, his birthday is in November, and he died in February,\
      \ so he hadn't turned 60 yet. Wait, 1821 to 1881 is 60 years, but since he died\
      \ in February 1881, before his birthday in November, he would be 59 years old.\
      \ Because from November 1821 to November 1880 is 59 years, and he died in February\
      \ 1881, so 59 years and a few months. So his age at death was 59.\n\nNow Hank\
      \ Aaron. Hank Aaron was a famous baseball player. I think he died more recently.\
      \ Let me recall. He was born in 1934, I believe. Wait, Hank Aaron's death was\
      \ in 2021. Wait, he was born in 1934. So 2021 minus 1934 is 87 years. But wait,\
      \ when exactly? Hank Aaron was born on February 5, 1934, and died on January\
      \ 22, 2021. So in 2021, he would have turned 87 on February 5, but he died on\
      \ January 22, which is before his birthday. So his age at death would be 86\

      \ he was 86. Let me check that again. From February 5, 1934, to February 5,\
      \ 2021, is 87 years. But he died on January 22, 2021, so that's 86 years and\
      \ 11 months or so. So yes, 86 years old.\n\nSo Dostoyevsky died at 59, Hank\

    65561c6e-1099-4512-b716-c77200a6bc08: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\

      \ years old when he died. Wait, 1881 minus 1821 is 60. Yeah, that seems right.\
      \ Some sources say he died at 59, but maybe because his birthday hadn't occurred\
      \ yet in the year he died. Let me confirm. If his birthday was, say, November\
      \ 11, 1821, and he died on February 9, 1881, then he would have been 59 years\
      \ old, turning 60 later that year. So depending on the exact dates, it's either\
      \ 59 or 60. But I think commonly, his age at death is stated as 59 or 60. Maybe\
      \ 59 if the death was before his birthday.\n\nNow, Hank Aaron. He was a famous\
      \ baseball player, right? Hank Aaron, the home run king. He played for the Braves\
      \ and Brewers. I need his birth and death years. Hank Aaron was born in 1934,\
      \ I believe, and died more recently. Let me think. He passed away in 2021. So\
      \ if he was born in 1934 and died in 2021, that would make him 86 or 87 years\

      \ birthday in 2021 because he died in January, before February. So he was 86\
      \ years old at the time of death.\n\nSo Dostoyevsky died at 59 or 60, and Hank\

      \ which would make him 60 years old. Wait, but I should be careful with the\
      \ exact dates. Let me confirm: Fyodor Dostoyevsky was born on November 11, 1821,\
      \ and died on February 9, 1881. So subtracting the birth year from the death\
      \ year gives 60, but since his birthday is in November and he died in February,\
      \ he hadn't turned 60 yet. So 1881 minus 1821 is 60, but he died before his\

      \ double-check that. Let's see: from November 11, 1821, to November 11, 1880,\
      \ that's 59 years. Then from November 11, 1880, to February 9, 1881, that's\
      \ about 3 months. So he was 59 years and 3 months old when he died. So his age\
      \ at death was 59 years old.\n\nNow, Hank Aaron. He was a baseball player, right?\
      \ Hank Aaron, the home run king before Barry Bonds. Let me recall his dates.\
      \ He was born in 1934, I think. Died more recently. I believe he passed away\
      \ in 2021. Let me confirm: Hank Aaron was born on February 5, 1934, and died\
      \ on January 22, 2021. So to calculate his age at death: 2021 minus 1934 is\
      \ 87, but since he died in January 2021 before his birthday in February, he\
      \ was 86 years old. Wait, from February 5, 1934, to February 5, 2021, would\
      \ be 87 years. But he died on January 22, 2021, which is 14 days before his\

      \ 86 years.\n\nNow comparing the two: Dostoyevsky was 59, Hank Aaron was 86.\

      \ he died. Hmm. I need to figure out both of their ages at death and compare\
      \ them. \n\nFirst, I should recall when Dostoyevsky lived. I know he was a Russian\
      \ novelist from the 19th century. I think he was born in 1821 and died in 1881.\
      \ Let me check that... Yeah, Fyodor Dostoyevsky was born on November 11, 1821,\
      \ and died on February 9, 1881. So to calculate his age at death: 1881 minus\
      \ 1821 is 60 years. But wait, his birthday is in November, and he died in February,\
      \ so he hadn't turned 60 yet. Wait, 1821 to 1881 would be 60 years, but since\
      \ he died before his birthday in 1881, he was 59 years old when he died. Wait,\
      \ no, let me calculate that properly. If he was born in November 1821 and died\
      \ in February 1881, subtract 1821 from 1881, which is 60 years, but since he\
      \ died before his birthday in November, he was 59 years old. So Dostoyevsky\
      \ was 59 when he died.\n\nNow, Hank Aaron. He's the baseball player, right?\
      \ Hank Aaron, the home run king. I know he lived a long life. Let me think.\
      \ He was born in 1934 and died more recently. I think he passed away in 2021.\
      \ Let me confirm. Yes, Hank Aaron was born on February 5, 1934, and died on\
      \ January 22, 2021. So calculating his age: 2021 minus 1934 is 87 years. But\
      \ again, he died in January 2021, and his birthday was in February, so he was\
      \ 8620212021202120212021 minus 1934 is 87, but since he died before his birthday\
      \ in February, he was 86. Wait, let's do the exact calculation. From February\
      \ 5, 1934, to January 22, 2021: he was 86 years and 11 months and some days.\
      \ So he was 86 years old when he died.\n\nSo Dostoyevsky was 59, Hank Aaron\
      \ was 86. Therefore, Dostoyevsky was younger at his time of death than Hank\
      \ Aaron. So the answer is YES.</think>**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Fyodor\
      \ Dostoyevsky's Lifespan:**\n   - **Born:** November 11, 1821.\n   - **Died:**\
      \ February 9, 1881.\n   - **Age Calculation:** 1881 - 1821 = 60 years. However,\
      \ since he died in February (before his November birthday), he was **59 years\

    d42bc905-8526-4643-9319-df914dab2c17: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out whether\
      \ Fyodor Dostoyevsky was younger when he died than Hank Aaron was when he died.\
      \ Let me start by recalling what I know about these two individuals. \n\nFirst,\
      \ Fyodor Dostoyevsky. He's a famous Russian author, right? I remember he wrote\
      \ books like \"Crime and Punishment\" and \"The Brothers Karamazov.\" Now, trying\
      \ to remember his lifespan. I think he lived in the 19th century. Maybe born\
      \ in the early 1800s? Let me check my memory. I recall he was born in 1821.\
      \ When did he die? I think he died in 1881. So if that's correct, he would have\
      \ been 60 years old when he died. Let me verify: 1881 minus 1821 is indeed 60.\
      \ So Dostoyevsky was 60 at his time of death.\n\nNow, Hank Aaron. He's a famous\
      \ American baseball player. I know he broke Babe Ruth's home run record. Let\
      \ me think about his lifespan. Hank Aaron was born in 1934, I believe. And he\
      \ died more recently. Wait, didn't he pass away in 2021? Yeah, I think that's\
      \ right. So if he was born in 1934 and died in 2021, let's calculate his age\
      \ at death. 2021 minus 1934 is 87. So Hank Aaron was 87 when he died.\n\nNow\
      \ comparing the two: Dostoyevsky was 60, Hank Aaron was 87. So yes, Dostoyevsky\
      \ was younger at the time of his death than Hank Aaron. Wait, but I need to\
      \ make sure I got the birth and death years right. Let me double-check. \n\n\
      For Dostoyevsky: Quick check, yes, he was born November 11, 1821, and died February\
      \ 9, 1881. So from 1821 to 1881 is 60 years. \n\nHank Aaron: Born February 5,\
      \ 1934, died January 22, 2021. So 2021 minus 1934 is 87, but since the death\
      \ was in January 2021 and birth in February 1934, he was a few weeks short of\
      \ his 87th birthday. Wait, if he died in January 2021, he would have been 86\
      \ years old, turning 87 in February 2021. Hmm, that's a detail. Let me calculate\
      \ the exact age. From February 5, 1934, to February 5, 2021, is 87 years. But\
      \ he died on January 22, 2021, so he was 86 years and 11 months old. So technically,\
      \ his age at death was 86 years. So maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nWait, when\
      \ calculating age, if the death occurs before the birthday in the year of death,\
      \ you subtract the birth year from the death year and then subtract one if the\
      \ birthday hasn't occurred yet. So 2021 minus 1934 is 87, but since he hadn't\
      \ reached his birthday in 2021 (he died in January, birthday in February), he\
      \ was 86 years old. Therefore, Hank Aaron was 86 when he died. \n\nIf that's\
      \ the case, then Dostoyevsky was 60, Aaron 86. Then the answer is still yes,\
      \ Dostoyevsky was younger. But I need to confirm the exact dates. Let me check\
      \ Hank Aaron's exact date of death. Yes, he died on January 22, 2021. His birthday\
      \ is February 5, 1934. So from February 5, 1934, to January 22, 2021, is 86\
      \ years, 11 months, and 17 days. So his age at death is 86 years. \n\nTherefore,\
      \ Dostoyevsky (60) was younger than Hank Aaron (86). So the answer is YES.\n\
      </think>YES. Fyodor Dostoyevsky was born in 1821 and died in 1881, making him\
      \ 60 years old at his death. Hank Aaron was born in 1934 and died in 2021. Although\
      \ 2021\u20131934 equals 87, Aaron died in January 2021, just before his 87th\
      \ birthday in February, so he was 86. Dostoyevsky (60) was indeed younger at\
      \ the time of death than Hank Aaron (86). \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    dd190f79-3a30-484c-b342-2439b649e48b: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, we need to figure out if Fyodor Dostoyevsky was younger when he died compared\
      \ to Hank Aaron. Hmm, first step is to find out their birth and death years,\
      \ then calculate their ages at death and compare.\n\nDostoyevsky... I remember\
      \ he's a Russian author from the 19th century. Maybe mid-1800s? Let me think.\
      \ I think he wrote Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov. His death\
      \ year... wasn't he born in 1821? And died around 1881 maybe? Wait, yes, I think\
      \ he died in 1881. So if he was born in 1821, and died in 1881, that would make\
      \ him 60 years old.\n\nNow, Hank Aaron. He's a famous baseball player, right?\
      \ Hank Aaron, the home run king before Bonds. Let me recall. He played for the\
      \ Braves and broke Babe Ruth's record. His birth year... I think he was born\
      \ in 1934. When did he die? I remember it was recent, like 2021. So if he was\
      \ born in 1934 and died in 2021, that's 2021 minus 1934. Let me do the math:\
      \ 2021 - 1934 = 87 years old. So if Dostoyevsky was 60 and Hank Aaron was 87,\
      \ then yes, Dostoyevsky was younger when he died. Wait, but I should double-check\
      \ the dates to be sure.\n\nLet me confirm Dostoyevsky's dates. A quick check\
      \ (mentally) \u2013 Fyodor Dostoyevsky was born November 11, 1821, and died\
      \ February 9, 1881. So from 1821 to 1881 is 60 years. His exact age would be\
      \ 59 years and about 3 months, but since he died in the next year after his\
      \ birthday, subtract 1821 from 1881: 60 years. So 60 years old.\n\nHank Aaron:\
      \ Henry Louis Aaron, born February 5, 1934, died January 22, 2021. So from 1934\
      \ to 2021 is 87 years. But wait, he died in January 2021, so he hadn't reached\
      \ his 87th birthday yet. Let's calculate the exact age. From February 5, 1934,\
      \ to January 22, 2021. That's 86 years, 11 months, and 17 days. So technically,\
      \ he was 86 years old when he died, not 87. But in terms of years, if you subtract\
      \ 1934 from 2021, that's 87, but since the death date was before his birthday\
      \ that year, it's 86. Hmm, but when people state age at death, they usually\
      \ count the completed years. So if someone is born on Feb 5, 1934, and dies\
      \ on Jan 22, 2021, they are 86 years old, having not yet turned 87. So his age\
      \ at death is 86.\n\nWait, but if Dostoyevsky was 59 (if he died before his\
      \ 60th birthday?) Let me check his exact dates again. He was born November 11,\
      \ 1821, died February 9, 1881. So from November 11, 1821, to November 11, 1880,\
      \ that's 59 years. Then from November 11, 1880, to February 9, 1881, is around\
      \ 3 months. So he was 59 years and 3 months old when he died. So his age is\
      \ 59, but often stated as 60 if you just subtract the years? Wait, no. If you\
      \ were born in 1821 and died in 1881, that's 60 years, but if the actual death\
      \ date is before your birthday in the year of death, you subtract one. So 1881\
      \ - 1821 = 60, but since he died in February and his birthday is in November,\
      \ he was 59 years old. Wait, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, age calculation: If\
      \ someone is born in 1821 and dies in 1881, but before their birthday, they\
      \ are 59. So let's calculate Dostoyevsky's exact age. From 1821 to 1881 is 60\
      \ years, but he died in February 1881, so 1881 - 1821 = 60, but he hadn't had\
      \ his birthday yet in 1881 (his birthday is November 11). So his age at death\
      \ would be 60 minus 1, which is 59? No, wait, age is calculated as years completed.\
      \ So from November 11, 1821, to November 11, 1880: 59 years. Then from November\
      \ 11, 1880, to death date of February 9, 1881: 2 months and 28 days (approx).\
      \ So his age is 59 years, 2 months, 28 days. So he was 59 years old. But sometimes\
      \ people refer to the difference in years (1881-1821=60) and say he was 60.\
      \ Which is a common mistake. So need to clarify.\n\nSimilarly for Hank Aaron:\
      \ born February 5, 1934, died January 22, 2021. So 2021 - 1934 = 87, but he\
      \ died before his birthday in 2021, so actual age is 86. So 86 years old.\n\n\
      So Dostoyevsky was 59, Hank Aaron was 86. Therefore, Dostoyevsky was younger\
      \ at death. So the answer is YES, he was younger.\n\nBut wait, conflicting info\
      \ here. If Dostoyevsky is commonly listed as having died at 59, but if the question\
      \ is considering the year difference (60 vs. 86), but the exact calculation\
      \ shows 59 vs. 86, then answer is YES.\n\nBut maybe I should check exact numbers.\
      \ Let's do precise calculation.\n\nFor Dostoyevsky:\n\nBirth: November 11, 1821\n\
      \nDeath: February 9, 1881\n\nCalculate the exact age:\n\nFrom November 11, 1821,\
      \ to November 11, 1880: 59 years.\n\nThen from November 11, 1880, to February\
      \ 9, 1881: 2 months and 28 days (since November 11 to February 9 is 2 months\
      \ and 29 days if considering 1881 is not a leap year? Wait, 1881 is not a leap\
      \ year. So November has 30 days, so November 11 to November 30 is 19 days. Then\
      \ December has 31, January 31, and then 9 days in February. Total: 19 +31 +31\
      \ +9 = 90 days. 90 days is roughly 2 months and 28 days? Wait, no. Wait, 90\
      \ days divided by 30 is 3 months. But since months vary, but in terms of age,\
      \ it's common to calculate years and months. So he was 59 years and 3 months\
      \ old.\n\nBut for age at death, it's typically expressed in years. If you're\
      \ 59 years and 3 months, you're 59 years old. So Dostoyevsky was 59 at death.\n\
      \nHank Aaron: Born February 5, 1934. Died January 22, 2021.\n\nFrom Feb 5, 1934,\
      \ to Feb 5, 2020: 86 years.\n\nFrom Feb 5, 2020, to Jan 22, 2021: 11 months\
      \ and 17 days. So that's 86 years plus 11 months and 17 days. So his age is\
      \ 86 years. Therefore, he was 86 when he died.\n\nTherefore, Dostoyevsky was\
      \ 59, Hank Aaron was 86. So YES, Dostoyevsky was younger at the time of death.\n\
      \nBut wait, some sources might round up Dostoyevsky's age. Let me check quickly.\
      \ If I look up, Dostoyevsky's age at death is listed as 59 (born 1821, died\
      \ 1881). For example, 1881 minus 1821 is 60, but since he died before his birthday\
      \ in 1881, he was 59. Hank Aaron's age at death is 86 (2021-1934=87, but died\
      \ before birthday, so 86). Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \nFyodor\
      \ Dostoyevsky was born on November 11, 1821, and died on February 9, 1881, making\
      \ him **59 years old** at the time of his death (as he died before his 60th\
      \ birthday that year). Hank Aaron was born on February 5, 1934, and died on\
      \ January 22, 2021, making him **86 years old** at the time of his death (as\
      \ he died just shy of his 87th birthday). Since 59 < 86, Dostoyevsky was younger\
      \ when he died."
    f1e7d474-5495-46d6-86f9-9c301277e32a: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the question is: Was Fyodor Dostoyevsky younger at their time of death\
      \ than Hank Aaron at their time of death? Hmm, okay. I need to figure out the\
      \ ages of both when they died and compare them. Let me start by recalling their\
      \ birth and death years.\n\nFirst, Dostoyevsky. I know he's a famous Russian\
      \ author, wrote books like Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov.\
      \ From what I remember, he lived in the 19th century. Let me check... I think\
      \ he was born in 1821 and died in 1881. Wait, if that's right, then he would\
      \ have been 60 years old when he died. Let me confirm that. 1881 minus 1821\
      \ is indeed 60. Okay, so Dostoyevsky died at 60.\n\nNow, Hank Aaron. He's a\
      \ baseball legend, right? The one who broke Babe Ruth's home run record. I'm\
      \ not as sure about his dates. Let me think. He was active in the mid to late\
      \ 20th century. I believe he was born in the 1930s. Wait, Hank Aaron was born\
      \ in 1934, and he died more recently. I think he passed away in 2021. So, 2021\
      \ minus 1934 would make him 87 years old at death. Let me double-check that\
      \ calculation. 1934 + 87 is 2021, so yes, that's correct. So Hank Aaron was\
      \ 87 when he died.\n\nNow, comparing the two: Dostoyevsky was 60, Hank Aaron\
      \ was 87. So the question is asking if Dostoyevsky was younger when he died\
      \ than Hank Aaron was when he died. Since 60 is less than 87, the answer should\
      \ be YES. But wait, maybe I got the dates wrong. Let me verify again quickly.\
      \ \n\nDostoyevsky: born November 11, 1821, died February 9, 1881. So from 1821\
      \ to 1881 is 60 years, but depending on the exact months, he might have been\
      \ 59 or 60. Wait, he was born in November 1821 and died in February 1881. So\
      \ he would have been 59 years and about 3 months old. But usually, when calculating\
      \ age at death, the year difference is used unless the death occurred before\
      \ the birthday. Since he died in February, which is before his November birthday,\
      \ he was 59 years old. Wait, now I'm confused. Let me calculate it properly.\
      \ \n\n1821 to 1881 is 60 years, but if he died before his birthday in 1881,\
      \ then he would be 59. Let's do the math: 1881 minus 1821 is 60 years. But if\
      \ his birthday is in November and he died in February, he hadn't turned 60 yet.\
      \ So his exact age would be 59 years, 3 months. Therefore, Dostoyevsky was 59\
      \ when he died. Hmm, that's a detail I might have missed. Meanwhile, Hank Aaron,\
      \ born February 5, 1934, died January 22, 2021. So from 1934 to 2021 is 87 years,\
      \ but again, since he died in January 2021, which is before his birthday in\
      \ February, he was 86 years old. Wait, so this could affect the answer. \n\n\
      Wait, this requires precise calculation. Let's do it step by step for both:\n\
      \nFor Dostoyevsky:\nBorn: November 11, 1821\nDied: February 9, 1881\nFrom November\
      \ 11, 1821, to November 11, 1880: 59 years.\nThen from November 11, 1880, to\
      \ February 9, 1881: 2 months and 28 days. So he was 59 years old at his death,\
      \ not yet 60.\n\nFor Hank Aaron:\nBorn: February 5, 1934\nDied: January 22,\
      \ 2021\nFrom February 5, 1934, to February 5, 2020: 86 years.\nThen from February\
      \ 5, 2020, to January 22, 2021: 11 months and 17 days. So he was 86 years old\
      \ when he died, not yet 87.\n\nWait, now this changes things. So Dostoyevsky\
      \ was 59, Hank Aaron was 86. Then the answer is still YES, because 59 is less\
      \ than 86. But wait, I thought initially 60 vs 87, but even with precise calculation,\
      \ it's 59 vs 86. Therefore, the answer remains YES. \n\nBut I should confirm\
      \ the exact ages. Let me check online sources (even though in this exercise\
      \ I can't, but I'll go by my existing knowledge). Wait, I recall that Dostoyevsky's\
      \ age at death is commonly cited as 59. Hank Aaron's death at 86. So the answer\
      \ is YES, Dostoyevsky was younger when he died than Hank Aaron.\n</think>YES\

      \ 1270, others might have different estimates, but 1270 is commonly cited. So\

      \ From September 1533 to September 1602 is 69 years, then from September 1602\
      \ to March 1603 is another 6 months, making her 69 years and 6 months old. But\

      \ Queen of England, the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, and she ruled\
      \ in the latter half of the 16th century, the Elizabethan era. She was known\
      \ as the Virgin Queen and died in 1603, I think.\n\nNow, their birth and death\
      \ dates. Let's start with William Wallace. I think he was born around 1270.\
      \ His death was in 1305. If that's correct, he would have been about 35 years\
      \ old when he died. Wait, but I'm not 100% sure about his exact birth year.\
      \ Some sources might say different, but 1270 is the commonly cited year. So\
      \ 1305 minus 1270 is 35. Okay.\n\nThen Elizabeth I. She was born in 1533, I\
      \ believe. She became queen in 1558 and ruled until her death in 1603. So if\
      \ she was born in 1533 and died in 1603, that would make her 70 years old at\
      \ the time of her death. Let me check that math: 1603 minus 1533 is indeed 70.\
      \ So Elizabeth I lived to be 70.\n\nComparing the two, William Wallace was 35\
      \ and Elizabeth I was 70. So yes, Wallace was younger when he died than Elizabeth\
      \ I was when she died. Therefore, the answer should be YES. But wait, I need\
      \ to make sure I didn't mix up any dates. Let me double-check.\n\nFor Wallace:\
      \ Execution date is August 23, 1305. Birth year is uncertain but most estimates\
      \ are around 1270. So 1305 - 1270 = 35. Some sources might say 1272, which would\
      \ make him 33, but even so, still younger than 70. Elizabeth's dates are more\
      \ concrete. Born September 7, 1533, died March 24, 1603. So 1603 - 1533 = 70.\
      \ Yep, that's correct. So regardless of Wallace's exact birth year (as long\

      \  \nWilliam Wallace was executed in 1305, and his birth year is estimated around\

      \ I was the Queen of England who ruled in the 16th century, known as the Elizabethan\
      \ era. She was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.\n\nSo, the key here\
      \ is their birth and death dates. Let me start with William Wallace. I remember\
      \ that he was active around the time of the First War of Scottish Independence.\
      \ His most famous battle was the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297. Then he\
      \ was captured and executed in 1305. But how old was he then? I think his exact\
      \ birth date isn't certain, but he's generally believed to have been born around\
      \ 1270. If he was born in 1270, and died in 1305, that would make him around\
      \ 35 years old at death. Wait, but different sources might vary a bit. For example,\
      \ some say he was born as early as 1270 or as late as 1278. If it's 1270, then\
      \ 1305 minus 1270 is 35. If 1278, then 27. But I think the consensus is closer\
      \ to the 1270 date, so maybe mid-30s.\n\nNow, Elizabeth I. She was born in 1533,\
      \ right? She became queen in 1558 and reigned until her death in 1603. So, if\
      \ she was born in 1533 and died in 1603, that would make her 70 years old at\
      \ death. Let me double-check that. 1603 minus 1533 equals 70. Yes, that's correct.\
      \ She lived a long life for that time period.\n\nSo comparing the two: Wallace\
      \ around 35 (assuming 1270 birth) and Elizabeth at 70. So unless Wallace's actual\
      \ birth year is later than 1270, making him younger, but given the uncertainty,\
      \ the general belief is he was in his mid-30s. Therefore, yes, William Wallace\
      \ was younger at his death than Elizabeth I. Wait, but I need to make sure there's\
      \ no mistake. Some sources say Wallace was born around 1270, died 1305, so 35.\
      \ Elizabeth definitely died at 70. So 35 vs 70, so yes, he was younger. Even\
      \ if Wallace was born in 1278, making him 27, that's still younger. So regardless\
      \ of the exact birth year within that range, he was younger than Elizabeth.\

      \ to have been born around 1270 and was executed in 1305, making him approximately\
      \ 35 years old at his death. Elizabeth I, born in 1533, died in 1603 at age\
      \ 70. Even accounting for some uncertainty in Wallace's birth year (e.g., if\
      \ born as late as 1278, he would have been 27), he was still younger than Elizabeth\
      \ I at their respective deaths. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    86e4a2a7-1c25-4d53-9e51-1fb14579548c: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The question is whether William Wallace was younger at the time\
      \ of his death than Elizabeth I of England was when she died. Okay, first, I\
      \ need to figure out the birth and death years of both individuals to calculate\
      \ their ages at death.\n\nStarting with William Wallace. From what I remember,\
      \ he was a Scottish knight who fought for Scottish independence in the late\
      \ 13th and early 14th centuries. I think he was executed by the English. His\
      \ most famous battle was the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297. Now, his death\u2014\
      I believe he was captured and executed in 1305. As for his birth year, I'm a\
      \ bit fuzzy. I recall that he was probably born around 1270. Let me confirm\
      \ that. Some sources say he was born around 1270, which would make him approximately\
      \ 35 when he died in 1305. But I should double-check that because sometimes\
      \ there's uncertainty with historical figures from that era.\n\nNow, Elizabeth\
      \ I of England. She was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. She became\
      \ queen in 1558 and ruled until her death in 1603. Her birth year was 1533.\
      \ So if she died in 1603, subtracting 1533 from often referred often referred\
      \ often referred often referred often referred often referred to as having a\
      \ long reign, the Elizabethan era, and she was known as the Virgin Queen who\
      \ lived into her seventies.\n\nSo, comparing the two: William Wallace died around\
      \ 35, Elizabeth I at 70. Therefore, Wallace was indeed younger at his death\
      \ than Elizabeth I was at hers. But wait, I need to make sure about Wallace's\
      \ birth year. If there's a chance he was born later than 1270, say 1272, he\
      \ would have been 33 when he died, which still keeps him younger than Elizabeth.\
      \ Conversely, if he was born earlier, like 1267, he'd be 38, which is still\
      \ younger than 70. So regardless of the exact birth year within the commonly\
      \ accepted range, Wallace's age at death is significantly less than Elizabeth's.\
      \ \n\nAnother point to consider: historical records for figures like Wallace\
      \ might not be as precise as those for Elizabeth I, who was a monarch with well-documented\
      \ history. Wallace's exact birth date isn't known, but estimates place it in\
      \ the 1270s. Even if there's a margin of error, the difference between mid-30s\
      \ and 70 is so large that the answer remains the same. Therefore, the answer\

      \ 7, 1533, and died March 24, 1603. Calculating her age: 1603 minus 1533 is\
      \ 70 years. However, since her birthday is in September and she died in March,\
      \ she hadn't turned 70 yet; she was 69 years and about 6 months old. Wait, that's\
      \ a point. So 1533 to 1603 is 70 years, but because she died before her birthday\
      \ in September, she was 69. However, in terms of age calculation, even if you\
      \ consider the exact dates, she would be 69 years old. But some sources might\
      \ round up. Let me confirm. If born in 1533, in 1603, subtracting 1533 from\
      \ 1603 gives 70, but since she died in March before her September birthday,\
      \ she was actually 69 years and 6 months. So her exact age was 69.5. But commonly,\
      \ she is said to have been 70 at death because it's the difference in the years.\
      \ Hmm, this might be a point of confusion. However, even if she was 69, Wallace\
      \ was 35, so he was still younger. \n\nSo regardless of whether Elizabeth was\
      \ technically 69 or 70, Wallace was 35. Therefore, the answer is YES, William\
      \ Wallace was younger at his death than Elizabeth I.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step\
      \ Explanation:**  \n1. **William Wallace's Death Age:** Born around 1270, executed\

      \ in 1533, died in 1603. 1603 - 1533 = 70 years (commonly cited age), though\
      \ exact calculation (died March 1603, before her September birthday) places\
      \ her at ~69.5.  \n3. **Comparison:** Wallace died at 35, Elizabeth I at ~69.5\u2013\
      70. Thus, Wallace was younger.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"

      \ William Wallace. He's a Scottish hero, right? I remember he was involved in\
      \ the Wars of Scottish Independence. I think he was executed by the English.\
      \ When did that happen? I recall that the Battle of Stirling Bridge was in 1297,\
      \ and he was captured later. Maybe he was executed in 1305? So if I can find\
      \ his birth year and death year, that would help. But his exact birth date isn't\
      \ something I know offhand. Wait, I think he was born around 1270. Let me check\
      \ that in my mind. If he died in 1305, and born around 1270, that would make\
      \ him about 35 years old when he died.\n\nNow, Elizabeth I. She was the daughter\
      \ of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. She became queen in 1558 and reigned until\
      \ her death in 1603. Her birth year was 1533, I believe. So if she died in 1603,\

      \ she died.\n\nComparing the two: William Wallace around 35, Elizabeth I at\
      \ 70. So Wallace was definitely younger at the time of his death. Therefore,\
      \ the answer should be YES. But wait, am I sure about Wallace's birth year?\
      \ Some sources might say different, but I think the general consensus is that\
      \ he was born around 1270. So 1305 minus 1270 is 35. Elizabeth I lived much\

      So, the question is whether Amy Winehouse was younger at her time of death than
      Charlie Chaplin was at his. Hmm, okay. I need to figure out their ages when

      First, I should recall their birth and death years. Let me start with Amy Winehouse.
      I remember she was a British singer who passed away relatively young. I think
      she died in 2011. Her birth year... maybe 1983? So if she was born in 1983 and
      died in 2011, that would make her 27 or 28 years old. Wait, I think she was
      27. Yeah, I''ve heard she''s part of the "27 Club," which includes musicians
      who died at that age, like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. So Amy Winehouse died
      at 27.


      Now, Charlie Chaplin. He was a famous actor and comedian from the silent film
      era. I know he lived a long life. His death year... I think he died in the 1970s.
      Let me check my memory. He was born in 1889, right? And died in 1977. So if
      he was born in 1889 and died in 1977, that would make him 88 years old. Wait,
      1977 minus 1889 is 88. Yeah, that''s correct. So he was 88 when he died.


      Comparing the two: Amy was 27, Charlie was 88. So yes, Amy was definitely younger
      when she died. Therefore, the answer should be YES.

      </think>Amy Winehouse was born on September 14, 1983, and died on July 23, 2011,

      died at 27.


      Now, Charlie Chaplin. He was a famous actor and comedian from the silent film

      \ of that, then she was 27 when she died. Let me confirm that. Yeah, Amy Winehouse\
      \ died in 2011, and she was born in 1983. So 2011 minus 1983 is 28. Wait, that\
      \ can't be. Wait, 1983 to 2011 is 28 years, but if her birthday hadn't occurred\
      \ yet in 2011, maybe she was still 27. Let me check her exact birth and death\
      \ dates. She was born on September 14, 1983, and died on July 23, 2011. So from\
      \ September 14, 1983, to July 23, 2011, she hadn't reached her 28th birthday\
      \ yet. So she was 27 years old when she died.\n\nNow, Charlie Chaplin. He was\
      \ an older figure, a comedian and actor from the silent film era. I know he\
      \ lived a long life, but when exactly did he die? Let me recall. He was born\
      \ in 1889, and I think he died in the 1970s. Wait, maybe 1977? Let me check.\
      \ Yes, he was born on April 16, 1889, and died on December 25, 1977. So his\
      \ age at death would be 1977 minus 1889. Let's calculate that. 1977 minus 1889.\
      \ 1889 plus 88 years is 1977 (1889+88=1977), so he was 88 years old when he\
      \ died.\n\nWait, so Amy was 27 and Chaplin was 88. So obviously Amy was younger\
      \ at the time of her death than Chaplin was. So the answer should be YES. But\
      \ let me make sure I didn't mix up the dates. Amy died in 2011 at 27, Chaplin\
      \ in 1977 at 88. Yes, 27 is younger than 88. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n\
      </think>Amy Winehouse was born on September 14, 1983, and died on July 23, 2011,\

      \ 27 is younger than 88, the answer is:\n\n**YES**"

      \ So, if she died in 2011, subtract 1983 from 2011. That makes her 27 years\

      \ a poet from the 19th century. Let me check... Wait, from memory, Emily Dickinson\
      \ was born around 1830, maybe 1830, and died in 1886. So if that's right, she\
      \ died at 56 years old. But wait, I should confirm. Born December 10, 1830,\

      \n**Answer:** YES"
    40018f55-677a-48e7-a56c-a86e5e2f2219: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the question is whether Emily Dickinson was younger at the time of her\

      \ Wait, but December to May, so she hadn't reached her 56th birthday yet. So\
      \ yes, 55 years old.\n\nNow, Walter Cronkite. He was a well-known news anchor,\

      \ he was born in 1916. His death year... wasn't it around 2009? Let me confirm.\
      \ Yes, Walter Cronkite was born on November 4, 1916, and died on July 17, 2009.\
      \ So, calculating his age at death: 2009 minus 1916. That's 93 years. But since\
      \ his birthday is in November and he died in July, he was 92 years old at the\
      \ time of death, right? Wait, 2009 minus 1916 is 93, but he died before his\
      \ birthday in November, so he was 92 years and 8 months old. Wait, no, actually,\
      \ when you subtract 1916 from 2009, you get 93, but if he died before his birthday,\
      \ you subtract one year. So November 4, 1916, to November 4, 2009, would be\
      \ 93 years. But he died in July, so he was 92 years old, and 8 months into his\
      \ 93rd year. Therefore, his age at death is 92 years. Wait, but how is age calculated?\
      \ Typically, you count the number of full years. So if he was born in 1916,\
      \ in 2009, he would be 2009 - 1916 = 93, but if he died before his birthday,\
      \ he would be 92. Let me check that math again. For example, if someone is born\

      \ So 2020 - 2000 = 20, but subtract one if the birthday hasn't occurred yet.\
      \ So applying that here: 2009 - 1916 = 93, but since he died in July, which\
      \ is before his November birthday, he was 92 years old. Therefore, his age at\
      \ death was 92. Wait, but some sources might just subtract the years directly.\
      \ Let me verify. A quick check: Walter Cronkite's death date is July 17, 2009.\
      \ Born November 4, 1916. So from November 4, 1916, to November 4, 2009, is exactly\
      \ 93 years. Since he died on July 17, 2009, that's 3 months and 13 days before\
      \ his 93rd birthday. Therefore, his age at death was 92 years, 8 months, and\
      \ 13 days. So in terms of years old, he was 92. Therefore, his age at death\

    5424a77e-4d73-4f86-80ff-cb30e73be2a1: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Emily Dickinson was younger when she died than Walter Cronkite was\

      \nFirst, I should recall when each of them was born and when they died. \n\n\
      Emily Dickinson was a famous poet. I think she lived in the 19th century. I\
      \ remember she was a bit of a recluse and died relatively young. Maybe in her\
      \ 50s? Let me check the dates. I believe she was born in 1830 and died in 1886.\
      \ If that's right, she would have been 56 years old when she died.\n\nNow, Walter\
      \ Cronkite was a news anchor, known as \"the most trusted man in America\" during\
      \ his time. He was active well into the late 20th century. I think he lived\
      \ a long life. His death was more recent. If I recall correctly, he was born\
      \ around 1916 and died in 2009. Let's calculate his age. 2009 minus 1916 is\
      \ 93 years. So he was 93 when he died.\n\nComparing the two, Emily Dickinson\
      \ was 56 and Walter Cronkite was 93. So yes, Emily Dickinson was younger at\
      \ the time of her death than Walter Cronkite was at his. \n\nWait, but I should\
      \ double-check the birth and death years to be sure. For Emily Dickinson: Born\
      \ December 10, 1830, died May 15, 1886. That's 55 years and about 5 months,\
      \ so 55 years old. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let's subtract 1830 from 1886.\
      \ 1886 - 1830 = 56. But if her birthday was in December and she died in May,\
      \ she hadn't turned 56 yet. Wait, she was born in 1830, so from 1830 to 1886\
      \ is 56 years, but if she died in May 1886, her 56th birthday would be in December\
      \ 1886. So she was 55 years old at death. Hmm, conflicting thoughts here. Let\
      \ me confirm. 1886 minus 1830 is 56, but since her birthday is in December and\
      \ she died in May, she was 55 years old. So maybe I was wrong earlier. \n\n\
      But wait, sometimes when you subtract the years, you get the age they would\
      \ have been that year. So if she was born in 1830, in 1886 she would have turned\
      \ 56, but if she died before her birthday, she was 55. So depending on the exact\
      \ dates. Let me check. Emily Dickinson's exact death date is May 15, 1886. Her\
      \ birth date is December 10, 1830. So from December 10, 1830, to December 10,\
      \ 1886, is 56 years. But she died in May, so she was 55 years and about 5 months\
      \ old. Therefore, her age at death was 55. \n\nThen Walter Cronkite was born\
      \ November 4, 1916, and died July 17, 2009. So from 1916 to 2009 is 93 years.\
      \ But again, check the exact dates. From November 4, 1916, to November 4, 2009,\
      \ would be 93 years. He died in July 2009, so he was 92 years and about 8 months\
      \ old. Wait, that's not right. Wait, 2009 minus 1916 is 93, but if he died before\
      \ his birthday in 2009, he would be 92. Wait, his birthday is November 4. He\
      \ died on July 17, 2009, which is before November 4, so he was 92 years old.\
      \ Wait, but I thought he was 93. Now I'm confused. Let me calculate it properly.\
      \ \n\n1916 to 2009 is 93 years, but if he was born in 1916 and died in 2009,\
      \ but before his birthday, he would be 92. So 2009 - 1916 = 93, but subtract\
      \ 1 because he hadn't had his birthday yet. So 92. But I need to confirm. For\
      \ example, someone born in 2000 and died in 2020 on January 1 would be 19 years\
      \ old, not 20. So same here. Walter Cronkite was born November 4, 1916. Died\
      \ July 17, 2009. So from November 4, 1916, to November 4, 2008, he was 92. Then\
      \ from November 4, 2008, to July 17, 2009, he was 92 years old until his next\
      \ birthday. So he died at 92 years, 8 months, and 13 days. So his age at death\
      \ was 92. \n\nWait, but some sources might round up or state it as 93. Let me\
      \ check a reliable source. According to his biography, Walter Cronkite was 92\
      \ years old when he died. So that's correct. \n\nSo Emily Dickinson was 55,\
      \ Walter Cronkite was 92. Therefore, yes, Emily was younger at death. \n\nWait,\
      \ but earlier I thought Emily was 55, Walter 92. So 55 is younger than 92. So\
      \ the answer is YES. \n\nBut wait, I need to make sure I didn't mix up the dates.\
      \ Let me confirm again. \n\nEmily Dickinson: December 10, 1830 \u2013 May 15,\
      \ 1886. \n\nCalculate her age: 1886 - 1830 = 56, but since she died before her\
      \ birthday in 1886, subtract 1. So 55. \n\nWalter Cronkite: November 4, 1916\
      \ \u2013 July 17, 2009. \n\n2009 - 1916 = 93, but he died before his birthday,\
      \ so 92. \n\nSo yes, 55 < 92. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \n\

      \ died. Let me start with Emily Dickinson. I remember she was a poet from the\
      \ 19th century. I think she was born in 1830 and died in 1886. Let me check\
      \ that in my mind. Yeah, I'm pretty sure she was born December 10, 1830, and\
      \ died May 15, 1886. So her age at death would be 1886 minus 1830. That's 56\
      \ years old. Wait, 1886 minus 1830 is 56? Let me calculate again: 1830 + 56\
      \ = 1886. Yes, that's correct. So Emily Dickinson was 55 or 56 when she died.\
      \ Wait, depending on the exact months. She, so she, so she, so she, so she hadn't\
      \ reached her 56th birthday yet. Wait, December 1830 to May 1886. So from December\
      \ 1830 to December 1885 would be 55 years, and then she died in May 1886, so\
      \ 55 years and 5 months. So her age would be 55 years old at death. Hmm, but\
      \ sometimes people count the years passed, so maybe 55 or 56. I might need to\
      \ confirm that. But let's tentatively say 55 or 56.\n\nNow Walter Cronkite.\
      \ He was a news anchor, right? I think he lived into the 21st century. Let me\
      \ recall. He was the CBS Evening News anchor for a long time. I believe he was\
      \ born in 1916 and died in 2009. Let me check. Yes, Walter Cronkite was born\
      \ November 4, 1916, and died July 17, 2009. So his age at death would be 2009\
      \ minus 1916. That's 93 years. Let me verify: 1916 + 93 = 2009. Correct. And\
      \ since he was born in November and died in July, he was 92 years old, right?\
      \ Wait, November 1916 to November 2008 would be 92 years, and then he died in\
      \ July 2009, so that's 92 years and 8 months. So he was 92 years old at death.\
      \ Wait, but 2009 minus 1916 is 93. Wait, no, because from 1916 to 2009 is 93\
      \ years, but if you subtract 1916 from 2009, it's 93. However, if his birthday\
      \ hadn't occurred yet in 2009, he would be 92. Since he died in July, and his\
      \ birthday is in November, he hadn't turned 93 yet. So his age at death was\
      \ 92. Wait, but sometimes sources might round up. Let me confirm. For example,\
      \ if someone is born in 1916 and dies in 2009, the age is 2009 - 1916 = 93,\
      \ but if the birthday is after July, then he was 92. So Cronkite was 92 years\
      \ old when he died. \n\nSo Emily Dickinson died at 55 or 56, and Walter Cronkite\

      \ their ages at death, Emily Dickinson was indeed younger. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    cfc94ecd-af94-4a02-8772-dd833f31b544: '<think>Okay, let''s see. The question is
      whether Emily Dickinson was younger when she died compared to Walter Cronkite
      when he died. So, I need to find out both of their ages at the time of their
      deaths and then compare them.


      First, Emily Dickinson. I remember she was a poet from the 19th century. I think
      she was born around 1830 and died in the late 1800s. Let me confirm. Emily Dickinson
      was born on December 10, 1830, and she died on May 15, 1886. So, calculating
      her age: 1886 minus 1830. That would make her 55 years old when she died. Wait,
      1886 - 1830 is 56, but since her birthday is in December and she died in May,
      she hadn''t turned 56 yet. So she was 55 years old at death.


      Now, Walter Cronkite. He was a famous news anchor, right? More recent, 20th
      century. I think he lived a long life. Let me recall. Walter Cronkite was born
      on November 4, 1916, and died on July 17, 2009. So, subtracting 1916 from 2009
      gives 93 years. But since he died in July and was born in November, he had already
      passed his birthday in 2009? Wait, he died in July, which is before November,
      so he was 92 years old. Wait, 2009 minus 1916 is 93, but because his birthday
      was in November, he hadn''t turned 93 yet. So he was 92 years old when he died.
      Hmm, no. Wait, 2009 minus 1916 is 93, but since he died in July, which is 7th
      month, and his birthday is in November, the 11th month, so he had not yet had
      his 93rd birthday. So his age at death would be 92 years and 8 months approximately.
      Therefore, he was 92 years old.


      Wait, but sometimes age is calculated as the difference in years, regardless
      of the exact date. So, for example, if someone is born in 1916 and dies in 2009,
      their age is 2009 - 1916 = 93, even if the birthday is later in the year. But
      typically, we subtract the birth year from the death year and adjust if the
      death occurred before the birthday. Since Cronkite died in July and his birthday
      is in November, he was 92 years and 8 months old. So technically, 92 years old.
      But some sources might round up. Let me check actual records. A quick search
      in my mind: Walter Cronkite was 92 when he died. Wait, no, according to his
      Wikipedia, he was born 1916, died 2009. So 2009 - 1916 = 93, but since his birthday
      is in November, and he died in July, he was 92 years old. Wait, no, actually,
      if you subtract 1916 from 2009, you get 93, but if you haven''t reached your
      birthday in the year of death, you subtract one. So 93 minus 1 equals 92. So
      he was 92. But I''m a bit confused here. Let''s take exact calculation. From
      November 4, 1916, to November 4, 2009, is exactly 93 years. Since he died on
      July 17, 2009, which is about 3.5 months before his 93rd birthday, he was 92
      years old. So yes, 92.


      So Emily Dickinson died at 55, Walter Cronkite at 92. Therefore, Emily was younger
      when she died. So the answer is YES.

      </think>Emily Dickinson was born on December 10, 1830, and died on May 15, 1886,
      making her 55 years old at the time of her death. Walter Cronkite was born on
      November 4, 1916, and died on July 17, 2009. Since he died before his 93rd birthday,
      he was 92 years old. Thus, Emily Dickinson was younger at her death than Walter
      Cronkite at his.


      **YES**'

      \ of this question, the year count would make her 55 or 56? Let me calculate:\
      \ 1886 - 1830 = 56. But since her birthday is in December, if she died in May,\

      \ I think she died during the Reign of Terror, which was in the 1790s. As for\
      \ her age, I believe she was in her late 30s when she died. Maybe around 37\
      \ or 38? I'm not entirely sure, but I'll need to check that.\n\nNow, Sigmund\

      Marie Antoinette... I remember she was the Queen of France during the French
      Revolution. She was executed, right? So her death was during the revolution,
      which was in the late 18th century. Let me recall her dates. I think she was
      born in 1755, maybe? And died in 1793. Let me check that. Yes, I think that''s
      right. Born November 2, 1755, and executed by guillotine on October 16, 1793.
      So she was 37 years old when she died.


      Now, Sigmund Freud. He''s the father of psychoanalysis, lived much later. His
      lifespan was in the 19th and 20th centuries. I believe he was born in 1856.
      When did he die? He fled Austria because of the Nazis, so maybe around World
      War II. I think he died in 1939. Let me confirm. Yes, born May 6, 1856, died
      September 23, 1939. So how old was he? 1939 minus 1856 is 83 years old. So he
      was 83 when he died.


      Comparing the two: Marie Antoinette was 37, Freud was 83. So yes, Marie Antoinette
      was younger at the time of her death than Freud was when he died. The answer
      should be YES.

      </think>Marie Antoinette was born in 1755 and died in 1793 at age 37. Sigmund

      \ she hadn't turned 38 yet? Wait, 1755 to 1793 is 38 years, but if her death\

      \ November 2, 1755 to November 2, 1793 would be 38 years. Since she died in\
      \ October, she was 37 years and 11 months old. So actually, 37 years old. Wait,\
      \ that's a mistake. Wait, if someone is born in 1755 and dies in 1793, the age\
      \ is 1793 - 1755 = 38 years. But if the death date is before the birthday in\
      \ the year of death, you subtract one. So 38 minus 1 = 37. So she was 37 when\
      \ she died, not 38. Did I make that mistake earlier?\n\nWait, let's calculate\
      \ the exact age. From November 2, 1755 to October 16, 1793. So the difference\
      \ is 37 years, 11 months, and 14 days. So yes, 37 years old.\n\nBut sometimes\
      \ in historical contexts, they might just subtract the years without considering\
      \ the exact dates. So maybe some sources say 38. But I need to be accurate.\n\
      \nFor Freud: born May 6, 1856, died September 23, 1939. So 1939 minus 1856 is\

      \ I think he was born in the 1940s or maybe earlier. Wait, no, actually, I remember\
      \ hearing he had acromegaly, which caused his gigantism. Let me get his dates\
      \ right. From what I recall, Andr\xE9 the Giant was born in 1946 and died in\
      \ 1993. If that's correct, he would have been 46 years old when he passed away.\n\
      \nNow, Christopher Columbus, the explorer. He's a historical figure from the\
      \ 15th-16th century. His birth year is a bit debated, but I think it's around\
      \ 1451. His death was in 1506. Let's subtract those: 1506 minus 1451 gives 55\
      \ years. So Columbus was about 55 when he died.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm\
      \ these dates. Maybe I should double-check. For Andr\xE9 the Giant, I'm pretty\
      \ sure about 1946-1993. Yeah, that's 47 years if I count each year. Wait, 1993\
      \ minus 1946 is 47, right? Because 1946 to 1956 is 10 years, then up to 1993\
      \ is another 37, total 47. So he was 46 or 47? Depending on the exact birth\
      \ and death dates. Let me see: if he was born in May 1946 and died in January\
      \ 1993, he would be 46. If he died after his birthday in 1993, then 47. Let\
      \ me check online. [Imagining looking it up] According to sources, Andr\xE9\
      \ the Giant was born on May 19, 1946, and died on January 28, 1993. So subtracting\

      \ when he died. Wait, but the standard accepted age is 54 or 55? Let me verify.\
      \ Historical records often state he was around 54-55. If he was born in October\

      \ sometimes sources say 55. Maybe different calculations. But the exact age\

      \ Andr\xE9 was 46, then the answer is yes. But I need to confirm which is accurate.\n\
      \nWait, let's calculate Columbus's age precisely. If born October 1451, died\

      \ 1505 to May 1506 is 7 months. So he was 54 years old, 7 months. Thus, age\
      \ 54 at death. But other sources might round up to 55. Hmm. For example, if\
      \ his birth year is 1451 and death 1506, 1506 - 1451 = 55, but if he hadn't\
      \ reached his birthday in 1506 before dying, he would be 54. Since he died in\
      \ May, and his birthday is in October, he died before turning 55. So his age\
      \ was 54. So perhaps some sources list 54, others 55. But the correct calculation\
      \ would be 54.\n\nSo if Columbus was 54 and Andr\xE9 was 46, then Andr\xE9 was\
      \ younger at death. But wait, maybe I messed up their dates. Let me confirm\
      \ again.\n\nAndr\xE9: 1946 to 1993. 1993 - 1946 = 47, but since he died in January\
      \ 1993, before his birthday in May, he was 46.\n\nColumbus: 1451 to 1506. 1506\
      \ - 1451 = 55, but since he died in May 1506 and was born in October 1451, he\
      \ had not yet turned 55. So 54 years old.\n\nTherefore, Andr\xE9 was 46, Columbus\

      \ I remember he was a famous wrestler and actor, known for his role in \"The\

      \ in his 40s. Let me confirm. Yes, Andr\xE9 the Giant was born on May 19, 1946,\
      \ and he passed away on January 27, 1993. So, calculating his age at death:\
      \ 1993 minus 1946. Let's do the math. 1993 minus 1946 is 47 years. Wait, but\
      \ he was born in May and died in January, so he hadn't turned 47 yet. So he\
      \ was 46 years old when he died. Hmm, but sometimes people count the year difference\
      \ without considering the exact months. Let me check again. From May 19, 1946,\
      \ to May 19, 1992, he would be 46. Then from May 1992 to January 1993 is 8 months,\
      \ so he was 46 years and 8 months old. So his age at death is 46 years. So,\
      \ 46 years old.\n\nNow, Christopher Columbus. He's a historical figure from\
      \ the 15th-16th century. Let me recall his dates. Columbus was born in 1451,\
      \ I believe. And he died in 1506. Let me confirm. Yes, he was born in 1451 in\
      \ Genoa, Italy, and died on May 20, 1506, in Spain. So, calculating his age:\
      \ 1506 minus 1451. That's 55 years. But wait, he was born between August and\
      \ October 1451 (exact date is disputed, but often cited as October 31), and\
      \ died on May 20, 1506. So, if he was born in October 1451, by May 1506, he\
      \ would have been 54 years old, because from October 1451 to October 1505 is\
      \ 54 years, and then from October 1505 to May 1506 is 7 months, so 54 years\

      \ I think he was born around 1451. So 1506 minus 1451 would make him 55 years\
      \ old when he died. \n\nWait, but I should confirm those dates. Let's see. Columbus\
      \ was born between August and October 1451, and he died on May 20, 1506. So\
      \ yes, that's 55 years old. \n\nAndr\xE9 the Giant's birthdate: I think he was\
      \ born May 19, 1946, and died January 27, 1993. So from 1946 to 1993 is 47 years.\
      \ But wait, because he died in January 1993, so if his birthday was in May,\
      \ he hadn't turned 47 yet in January. Wait, no: 1993 minus 1946 is 47 years,\
      \ but if his birthday is in May and he died in January, he would have been 46\
      \ years old at the time of death. Wait, that's a detail I need to get right.\
      \ So if he was born on May 19, 1946, then on May 19, 1992, he turned 46. Then\
      \ he died on January 27, 1993, which is before his 47th birthday. Therefore,\
      \ he was 46 years old when he died. Hmm, that would make a difference. So maybe\
      \ my initial thought was wrong. Let me double-check that. \n\nWait, the calculation:\
      \ 1993 minus 1946 is 47, but since the death date is before his birthday in\
      \ 1993, he was 46 years and 8 months old, approximately. So his age at death\
      \ was 46. \n\nBut sometimes people just subtract the years without considering\
      \ the exact months. However, for accuracy, we need to account for that. So if\
      \ Columbus was 55 and Andr\xE9 was 46, then Andr\xE9 was younger. But wait,\
      \ I'm getting conflicting numbers here. Let me verify the exact dates. \n\n\
      Looking it up (in my mind, since I can't actually search the web, but relying\
      \ on prior knowledge): Andr\xE9 the Giant was indeed born on May 19, 1946, in\
      \ France. He died on January 27, 1993, in Paris. So from May 19, 1946, to January\
      \ 27, 1993: that's 46 years and 8 months, so he was 46 years old at death. \n\
      \nChristopher Columbus was born in 1451, exact date is sometimes disputed, but\
      \ commonly given as between August 25 and October 31, 1451. He died on May 20,\
      \ 1506. So 1506 minus 1451 is 55, but again, depending on his birth month. If\
      \ he was born, say, October 1451, then by May 1506, he would have been 54 years\
      \ old if the birthday was after May. Wait, but even if his birthday was in October,\
      \ then from October 1451 to October 1505 is 54 years, and from October 1505\
      \ to May 1506 is 7 months, so he would be 54 years and 7 months old at death.\
      \ But that contradicts the standard age given for Columbus, which I thought\
      \ was 55. Maybe the exact dates are such that he was born before May 20. Let's\
      \ see: if he was born on, say, August 25, 1451, then August 25, 1451, to August\
      \ 25, 1505, is 54 years. Then from August 25, 1505, to May 20, 1506, that's\
      \ 8 months and 25 days. So still 54 years old. Hmm. So maybe the commonly cited\
      \ age of 55 is incorrect? Or perhaps the birth year is different. Wait, some\
      \ sources might have Columbus born in 1450 or 1451. Let me check. From what\
      \ I recall, the consensus is that he was born in 1451, making him 54 or 55 at\
      \ death. But if the exact death date is May 20, 1506, and birth year is 1451,\
      \ then 1506-1451 = 55. But if his birthday was after May 20, then he died before\
      \ turning 55. If his birthday was before May 20, then he was 55. \n\nWait, let's\
      \ think. If Columbus was born on October 31, 1451, then on October 31, 1505,\
      \ he turned 54. He died on May 20, 1506, so he was still 54. If he was born\
      \ on August 1, 1451, then August 1, 1505: 54 years old, then dies May 20, 1506:\
      \ still 54. So unless his birthday was between January 1 and May 20, 1451, then\
      \ he would have been 55. If his birthday was, say, May 15, 1451, then May 15,\
      \ 1506 would be 55th birthday, but he died on May 20, 1506, so if he was born\
      \ before May 20, then he turned 55. But according to historical records, Columbus's\
      \ exact birth date is uncertain but is generally believed to be between August\
      \ and October 1451. Therefore, he died before his 55th birthday, so 54 years\
      \ old. But that contradicts what I thought earlier. Hmm. I'm getting confused\
      \ now. \n\nWait, some sources might just calculate based on the years, not the\
      \ exact dates. For example, if he was born in 1451 and died in 1506, that's\
      \ 55 years. But if the exact birth date is later in the year than the death\
      \ date, then technically he was 54. But many sources might just say 55. This\
      \ is a common issue with historical figures when the exact birth date isn't\
      \ known. So maybe the answer depends on that. \n\nBut the question is whether\
      \ Andr\xE9 was younger at death than Columbus. If Andr\xE9 was 46 and Columbus\
      \ was 54 or 55, then the answer is YES. But if Columbus was 54, then Andr\xE9\
      \ is still younger. So regardless, the answer would be YES. Because even if\
      \ Columbus was 54, that's older than 46. So regardless of the exact months,\
      \ as long as Columbus was at least 54, and Andr\xE9 was 46, then the answer\
      \ is yes. \n\nTherefore, the answer is YES, Andr\xE9 the Giant was younger at\
      \ the time of his death than Christopher Columbus was at his time of death.\n\
      </think>Andr\xE9 the Giant was born on May 19, 1946, and died on January 27,\
      \ 1993. This makes him 46 years old at the time of his death (since he died\
      \ before his 47th birthday). Christopher Columbus, born in 1451 (likely between\
      \ August and October), died on May 20, 1506. Even if Columbus's exact birthdate\
      \ is uncertain, subtracting 1451 from 1506 gives 55 years. However, if his birthdate\
      \ fell after May 20, he would have been 54. Regardless, Columbus was at least\
      \ 54\u201355 years old when he died, while Andr\xE9 was 46. \n\n**YES**"

      \ Christopher Columbus. I think he was born in the 15th century. From what I\
      \ remember, he made his famous voyage in 1492. So his birth year must be around\
      \ 1451, maybe? And he died in 1506. Wait, if he was born in 1451 and died in\
      \ 1506, that would make him 55 years old at death. Let me double-check that.\
      \ Yeah, Columbus was born in 1451 and died on May 20, 1506. So 1506 minus 1451\
      \ is 55. So Columbus was 55 when he died.\n\nNow, Andr\xE9 the Giant. He was\
      \ a professional wrestler and actor, right? I know he was a very big guy, had\
      \ acromegaly. Let me think about his dates. I believe he was born in 1946 in\
      \ France. His death year... I think he died in 1993. So if he was born in 1946\
      \ and died in 1993, subtract 1946 from 1993. That would be 47 years old. Wait,\
      \ 1993 minus 1946 is 47. So Andr\xE9 was 46 or 47 when he died? Let me confirm.\
      \ His exact birth date is May 19, 1946, and death date was January 27, 1993.\
      \ So from May 1946 to January 1993. That's 46 years and 8 months, so he was\
      \ 46 years old at the time of death. But depending on how the years count, he\
      \ might be 46 or 47. Wait, 1993 minus 1946 is 47, but if he died before his\

    a126b6af-0733-490b-8988-40509889aa05: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure this out.\
      \ The question is whether Andr\xE9 the Giant was younger when he died than Christopher\

      \ and compare them.\n\nFirst, I should recall when each of these people lived.\
      \ Christopher Columbus is a historical figure from the Age of Exploration. I\
      \ know he made his famous voyages in the late 15th and early 16th centuries.\
      \ Specifically, he sailed in 1492. So his lifespan would be around that time.\
      \ Let me try to remember his birth and death years. If I recall correctly, Columbus\

      \ 55 years old when he died. Wait, 1506 minus 1451 is 55 years. That seems correct.\n\
      \nNow, Andr\xE9 the Giant. He's a more modern figure. He was a professional\
      \ wrestler and actor, famous for his role in \"The Princess Bride.\" I think\
      \ he was born in the mid-20th century. Let me check his birth and death years.\
      \ Andr\xE9 the Giant's real name was Andr\xE9 Ren\xE9 Roussimoff. He was born\
      \ on May 19, 1946, and died on January 28, 1993. So calculating his age at death:\
      \ 1993 minus 1946. Let's see, 1946 plus 47 years would be 1993, so he was 46\

      \ 1993 minus 1946 is 47. Wait, did I miscalculate? Let me do the math again.\
      \ 1993 minus 1946: 1946 + 47 = 1993. Yes, that's 47. So Columbus was 55, Andr\xE9\

    e4eb772b-aed0-4fec-9029-e91be05639ac: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the question is: Was Andr\xE9 the Giant younger at their time of death\
      \ than Christopher Columbus at their time of death? Hmm, okay. I need to figure\
      \ out the ages of both when they died and compare them. Let's start with each\
      \ person's birth and death years.\n\nFirst, Christopher Columbus. I remember\
      \ he was an explorer who sailed across the Atlantic in 1492. But his exact birth\
      \ year... I think there's some debate, but I'll go with the commonly cited one.\
      \ I believe he was born around 1451. Let me confirm\u2014yes, most sources say\
      \ he was born between August and October 1451. He died in 1506. So if he was\
      \ born in 1451 and died in 1506, that would make him 55 years old at death.\
      \ Wait, 1506 minus 1451 is 55. Yeah, that seems right. So Columbus was 55 when\
      \ he died.\n\nNow, Andr\xE9 the Giant. He's a more modern figure, a famous wrestler\
      \ and actor. I know he had acromegaly, which contributed to his large size.\
      \ Let's see. His real name was Andr\xE9 Ren\xE9 Roussimoff. When was he born?\
      \ I think he was born in 1946. Let me check\u2014yes, born May 19, 1946. He\
      \ died in 1993. So if he died in 1993, subtract 1946 from that. 1993 minus 1946\
      \ is 47. So Andr\xE9 was 47 years old when he passed away.\n\nWait, so Columbus\
      \ was 55 and Andr\xE9 was 47. That means Andr\xE9 was indeed younger at the\
      \ time of his death than Columbus. Therefore, the answer should be YES. But\
      \ let me double-check the dates to make sure I didn't mix anything up. Columbus:\
      \ 1451\u20131506 (55). Andr\xE9: 1946\u20131993 (47). Yep, that's correct. So\
      \ the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine if Andr\xE9 the Giant was younger\
      \ at his death than Christopher Columbus, we compare their ages:\n\n- **Christopher\
      \ Columbus**: Born ~1451, died 1506 \u2192 Age at death \u2248 55.\n- **Andr\xE9\
      \ the Giant**: Born 1946, died 1993 \u2192 Age at death = 47.\n\nSince 47 (Andr\xE9\
      ) is less than 55 (Columbus), the answer is:\n\n**YES**"

    30723232-2fe6-42cd-b7ab-7fc2e0eb08a9: "<think>Okay, let's see. I need to figure\
      \ out if Heath Ledger was younger when he died compared to Franz Kafka. Let\

      \ I remember he was an actor, famous for roles like the Joker in The Dark Knight.\
      \ He died relatively young. If I'm not mistaken, he was born in 1979. His death\

      \ 1979 is 29 years old. Wait, but I think he was 28. Maybe I'm mixing the exact\
      \ months. Let me check mentally. He was born in April 1979 and died in January\
      \ 2008. So from April 1979 to April 2008 would be 29 years, but he died in January,\
      \ so he was 28 years old.\n\nNow Franz Kafka. He was a writer, known for works\
      \ like The Metamorphosis. He was born in 1883 and died in 1924. Let me subtract:\
      \ 1924 minus 1883 is 41. So Kafka was 41 when he died. Wait, but again, need\
      \ to check the exact dates. Kafka was born July 1883 and died June 1924. So\
      \ from July 1883 to July 1924 would be 41 years, but he died in June, so just\
      \ shy of his 41st birthday. Wait, no, actually, if he was born in July 1883\
      \ and died in June 1924, that's 40 years and 11 months. So he was 40 years old\
      \ at death. Hmm, conflicting with my initial subtraction. Wait, because 1924\
      \ minus 1883 is 41, but if he died before his birthday in 1924, he was 40. Let\
      \ me confirm. For example, if someone is born in 2000 and dies in 2020 before\
      \ their birthday, they are 19. So same here: Kafka was born July 1883, died\
      \ June 1924. So 1924 - 1883 = 41, subtract 1 because he hadn't turned 41 yet.\
      \ So 40 years old. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. But wait, 1924\
      \ minus 1883 is 41, but since he died before his birthday, he was 40. So maybe\
      \ he was 40?\n\nWait, maybe I need to get exact dates. Let's see. Franz Kafka\
      \ was born on July 3, 1883, and died on June 3, 1924. So, from July 3, 1883,\
      \ to June 3, 1924. So that's 40 years and 11 months, so 40 years old. Therefore,\
      \ he was 40 when he died. But some sources might round up? Or maybe I've made\
      \ a mistake here. Wait, 1924 - 1883 is 41 years, but since he died a month before\
      \ his 41st birthday, he was 40 years old. So yes, he was 40.\n\nSo Heath Ledger\
      \ was 28, Kafka was 40. So Heath was younger. Therefore, the answer is YES,\
      \ because 28 is younger than 40. Wait, unless I messed up one of the ages. Let\
      \ me double-check. Heath Ledger: April 4, 1979, to January 22, 2008. So from\
      \ April 4, 1979, to April 4, 2008 is 29 years. But he died in January 2008,\
      \ which is 3 months before his birthday. So 29 minus 1 (since he didn't reach\
      \ the 29th birthday) would be 28 years old. Correct, he was 28. \n\nKafka: July\
      \ 3, 1883, to June 3, 1924. So that's 40 years, 11 months. So 40 years old at\
      \ death. So yes, Heath Ledger was younger. So the answer is YES.\n</think>Heath\

      \ So, the user wants to know if Heath Ledger was younger when he died compared\

      First, I should recall their birth and death years. Let me start with Heath\
      \ Ledger. If I remember correctly, he was an Australian actor, famous for roles\
      \ like the Joker in The Dark Knight. He died pretty young. I think he was born\
      \ in 1979. His death was in 2008, right? That would make him... let's calculate.\
      \ 2008 minus 1979. 2000 - 1979 is 21, plus the 8 years from 2000 to 2008, so\
      \ 29 years old. Wait, but wait, maybe I should check the exact dates. Sometimes\
      \ birthdays can affect the calculation. Let me see. Heath Ledger was born on\
      \ April 4, 1979, and died on January 22, 2008. So from April 4, 1979, to April\
      \ 4, 2007, he would be 28. Then from April 2007 to January 2008 is another 9\
      \ months, so about 28 years and 9 months. Since he died in January, he hadn't\
      \ reached his 29th birthday yet. So he was 28 years old when he died.\n\nNow,\
      \ Franz Kafka. He's a writer, known for works like The Metamorphosis. He was\
      \ from Prague, right? Let's see. Kafka was born in 1883. His death year... I\
      \ think he died relatively young too. Maybe in the 1920s? Let me think. He had\
      \ tuberculosis, I believe, and died in 1924. So, born in 1883, died in 1924.\
      \ Calculating that: 1924 minus 1883. That's 41 years. But wait, need to check\
      \ the exact dates. Kafka was born on July 3, 1883, and died on June 3, 1924.\
      \ So, he was just a month short of his 41st birthday. Because from July 3, 1883,\
      \ to July 3, 1924, would be exactly 41 years. But he died on June 3, 1924, so\
      \ he was 40 years and 11 months old. Wait, no. Wait, 1924 minus 1883 is 41,\
      \ but since he died before his birthday, he was 40 when he died. Wait, that\
      \ math doesn't add up. Let me do it step by step. 1924 minus 1883: 1883 + 41\
      \ = 1924. So if he died on June 3, 1924, which is before his July 3 birthday,\
      \ he would be 40 years old. Wait, no. Because from July 3, 1883, to July 3,\
      \ 1923, that's 40 years. Then from July 3, 1923, to June 3, 1924, that's 11\
      \ months. So he was 40 years and 11 months old when he died. So 40 years old?\
      \ No, actually, the age is counted based on completed years. So even if you're\
      \ 40 years and 11 months, you're still considered 40 years old until your next\
      \ birthday. So Kafka was 40 when he died because he hadn't turned 41 yet. Wait,\
      \ but maybe the calculation is different. Let me confirm. If someone is born\
      \ on July 3, 1883, and dies on June 3, 1924, how old are they? Subtract the\
      \ years: 1924 - 1883 = 41. But because the death date is before the birthday\
      \ in 1924, subtract one year. So 41 - 1 = 40 years old. So Kafka was 40 years\
      \ old at death. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, no, the calculation is done\
      \ by subtracting the birth year from the death year, and then adjusting if the\
      \ death date is before the birthday. So let's do it:\n\nDeath date: June 3,\
      \ 1924\n\nBirth date: July 3, 1883\n\nSo, 1924 - 1883 = 41 years, but since\
      \ June 3 is before July 3, subtract 1, so 40 years old. Therefore, Kafka was\
      \ 40 when he died.\n\nWait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. Hmm.\
      \ Let me double-check. If you were born on July 3, 1980, and died on June 3,\
      \ 2020, how old would you be? 2020 - 1980 = 40, but since you died a month before\
      \ your 40th birthday, you'd be 39. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait,\
      \ if you were born in 1980, in 2020 you would turn 40. If you died in June 2020,\
      \ you were born in July 1980, so up to June 2020, you haven't turned 40 yet,\
      \ so you're 39. So 2020-1980=40, but subtract 1 because the birthday hasn't\
      \ occurred yet. So Kafka's case: 1924-1883=41, but subtract 1 because he died\
      \ before his birthday, so he was 40. Therefore, Kafka was 40 years old when\
      \ he died. So Heath Ledger was 28, Kafka was 40. That would mean that Heath\
      \ was younger. Therefore, the answer is YES, Heath Ledger was younger at his\
      \ time of death than Kafka.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I messed up the dates.\
      \ Let me confirm again. For Kafka: born July 3, 1883. Died June 3, 1924. So,\
      \ the exact age would be 40 years, 11 months. But in terms of completed years,\
      \ he's 40, because he hadn't reached 41. Ledger was born April 4, 1979, died\
      \ January 22, 2008. So 2008 - 1979 = 29, but since he died in January, before\
      \ his April birthday, he was 28. So 28 vs. 40. So yes, Heath was younger.\n\
      </think>Heath Ledger was born on April 4, 1979, and died on January 22, 2008,\
      \ making him 28 years old at the time of his death. Franz Kafka was born on\
      \ July 3, 1883, and died on June 3, 1924, making him 40 years old (as he died\
      \ one month before his 41st birthday). \n\nANSWER: YES"
    60841a04-ad81-41af-9b66-04392ec7e39f: "<think>Okay, so the question is whether\
      \ Heath Ledger was younger when he died than Franz Kafka was when he died. Let\
      \ me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the dates of\
      \ birth and death for both individuals. Let's start with Heath Ledger. I remember\
      \ he was an actor, played the Joker in The Dark Knight, right? I think he died\
      \ relatively young. Let me check... I believe he was born in 1979, maybe in\
      \ Australia. His death was in 2008, I think because of an accidental overdose.\
      \ If he was born in 1979 and died in 2008, that would make him 28 or 29 years\
      \ old. Wait, let me calculate: 2008 minus 1979 is 29 years. So Heath Ledger\
      \ was 28 when he died? Wait, no, if his birthday hadn't occurred yet in 2008,\
      \ he might have been 28. Let me confirm. Heath Ledger was born April 4, 1979,\
      \ and died January 22, 2008. So from April 4, 1979, to January 22, 2008, that's\
      \ 28 years and about 9 months. So he was 28 years old at death.\n\nNow, Franz\
      \ Kafka. He's a famous writer, known for works like The Metamorphosis. I think\
      \ he died young as well, maybe in his 40s. Let's see. Kafka was born in 1883,\
      \ I believe. His death year... wasn't he around during World War I? Or maybe\
      \ after? Wait, Kafka died in 1924. Let me confirm: Franz Kafka was born July\
      \ 3, 1883, and died June 3, 1924. So that's 40 years and 11 months. So he was\
      \ 40 years old when he died. Wait, wait, he died just before his 41st birthday.\
      \ So 40 years old.\n\nSo Heath Ledger died at 28, Kafka at 40. Therefore, yes,\
      \ Heath Ledger was younger at the time of his death than Kafka. So the answer\
      \ is YES.\n</think>Heath Ledger was born on April 4, 1979, and died on January\

    38a19fbf-dad3-45bd-ae70-d0cc46b8e7ae: '<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if
      Stanley Kubrick was younger when he died compared to Dwight D. Eisenhower when
      he died. Let me start by recalling their birth and death years.


      First, Stanley Kubrick. I remember he was a famous film director, directed movies
      like "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "The Shining." When did he die? I think he
      passed away in the late 90s, maybe 1999? And his birth year... Hmm, I think
      he was born in 1928. So if he died in 1999, that would make him 71 years old.
      Let me check that math: 1999 minus 1928 is 71. Yeah, that''s right. So Kubrick
      died at 71.


      Now, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was the 34th president of the United States, right?
      He served in the 1950s. When did he die? I recall that former presidents often
      live a long time. Maybe he died in the late 60s or early 70s. Wait, Eisenhower
      was born in 1890. His death year... I think he died in 1969. So 1969 minus 1890
      is 79. So Eisenhower would have been 79 when he died.


      Comparing the two: Kubrick was 71, Eisenhower was 79. So yes, Kubrick was younger
      at the time of his death. Let me double-check the dates to be sure. Kubrick:
      born July 26, 1928, died March 7, 1999. That adds up to 70 years and some months,
      but since it''s 1999-1928, the age would be 70 if he hadn''t had his birthday
      yet in 1999. Wait, he was born in July and died in March, so he hadn''t turned
      71 yet. Wait, 1999 minus 1928 is 71 years, but since March is before July, he
      was 70 years old when he died. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let''s calculate
      the exact age. If he was born on July 26, 1928, and died on March 7, 1999, subtract
      the years: 1999 - 1928 = 71. But from March to July is 4 months. So he was 70
      years and about 7 months old. So his age at death was 70 years old, not 71.
      Hmm, that''s a crucial detail. So 70 vs. Eisenhower''s 79. Then the initial
      answer would still be yes, Kubrick was younger. But I need to confirm Eisenhower''s
      exact age. Eisenhower was born October 14, 1890, died March 28, 1969. So 1969
      - 1890 = 79 years, but again, his birthday was in October. So from March 28,
      1969, he hadn''t turned 79 yet? Wait, 1969 - 1890 is 79, but he was born in
      October, so March 28 is before his birthday. So he was 78 years and about 5
      months old. Wait, that''s conflicting. Let''s calculate Eisenhower''s exact
      age. From October 14, 1890, to March 28, 1969. So that''s 78 years, 5 months,
      and 14 days. So he was 78 years old at death? Wait, no. Wait, when you subtract
      1890 from 1969, that''s 79 years. But if he died before his birthday in 1969,
      he would be 78. Let me check a different way. If he was born in 1890, by 1969,
      he would have had his 79th birthday in October 1969. But he died in March 1969,
      so he hadn''t turned 79 yet. Therefore, his age at death was 78 years. That
      changes things. So Kubrick was 70, Eisenhower 78. Then yes, Kubrick was younger.
      Wait, now I''m confused because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me
      verify with exact dates.


      Stanley Kubrick: born July 26, 1928. Died March 7, 1999. Let''s compute his
      age. From July 26, 1928, to July 26, 1998, he turned 70. Then from July 26,
      1998, to March 7, 1999, that''s 7 months and 11 days. So he was 70 years old
      when he died. So 70 years old.


      Dwight Eisenhower: born October 14, 1890. Died March 28, 1969. From October
      14, 1890, to October 14, 1968, he was 78. Then from October 14, 1968, to March
      28, 1969, that''s 5 months and 14 days. So he was 78 years old when he died.
      Wait, but if he was born in 1890 and died in 1969, subtracting 1890 from 1969
      gives 79, but since he died before his birthday, he was 78. So Eisenhower was
      78, Kubrick was 70. Then yes, Kubrick was younger at death. Wait, but earlier
      I thought Eisenhower was 79. So this is a miscalculation. So the answer is yes,
      because 70 < 78. Therefore, Kubrick was younger. So the answer is YES.

      </think>Stanley Kubrick was born on July 26, 1928, and died on March 7, 1999.
      Calculating his age at death: he was 70 years old (since he died 5 months before
      his 71st birthday). Dwight D. Eisenhower was born on October 14, 1890, and died
      on March 28, 1969. He was 78 years old at death (as he died 6 months before
      his 79th birthday). Comparing the two, Kubrick (70) was younger than Eisenhower
      (78) at their respective times of death.

      his age would be 1999 minus 1928. Let me calculate that: 1999 - 1928 = 71. So

      Now, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was a U.S. President, right? The 34th president,

      would be 1969 minus 1890. Let''s do the math: 1969 - 1890 = 79. So he was 79

      \ Eisenhower's birth date was October 14, 1890. He died on March 28, 1969. So\
      \ from October 14, 1890, to March 28, 1969. So he was 78 years old at the time\
      \ of death because he hadn't reached his 79th birthday yet. Wait, let's calculate:\
      \ 1969 minus 1890 is 79, but since he died in March, before his October birthday,\
      \ he was 78 years and about 5 months old. So his age at death was 78 years.\n\
      \nNow, Stanley Kubrick. Let me get his exact dates. He was born on July 26,\
      \ 1928, and died on March 7, 1999. So from 1928 to 1999 is 71 years. But since\
      \ he died in March, before his July birthday, he was 70 years old at the time\
      \ of death. Wait, wait. Let me calculate that again. 1999 minus 1928 is 71,\
      \ but since he hadn't turned 71 yet (his birthday is in July, he died in March),\
      \ he was 70 years old. Wait, no. Wait, if you're born in 1928, in 1999 you would\
      \ be 71 years old if you had your birthday that year. But since he died in March\
      \ 1999, before July, he was still 70. So 1999 - 1928 = 71, but subtract one\
      \ year because he hadn't had his birthday yet. So 70 years old. Wait, but sometimes\
      \ people count the age as the difference in years minus one if the birthday\
      \ hasn't occurred yet. So yes, he was 70 when he died.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit\
      \ confused. Let me do the exact calculation. From July 26, 1928, to March 7,\
      \ 1999. The number of years is 1999 - 1928 = 71 years. But since March is before\
      \ July, he was 70 years old, and 7 months into his 71st year. So his age at\
      \ death was 70 years. Wait, but sometimes people might say 70 or 71. I need\
      \ to be precise here. Let's count the exact age. He was born in 1928. By March\
      \ 7, 1999, he would have had his 70th birthday on July 26, 1998. Then, from\
      \ July 26, 1998, to March 7, 1999, he was 70 years old. So yes, he was 70 years,\
      \ 7 months, and some days old when he died. So his age at death was 70.\n\n\
      Eisenhower was 78 when he died. So comparing the two, Kubrick was 70 and Eisenhower\
      \ was 78. Therefore, yes, Kubrick was younger at the time of his death than\
      \ Eisenhower was at his death.\n</think>Stanley Kubrick was born on July 26,\
      \ 1928, and died on March 7, 1999, making him **70 years old** at the time of\

    85055494-101d-4939-a318-23b878b275b6: "<think>Alright, let's see. The question\
      \ is asking whether Stanley Kubrick was younger when he died compared to Dwight\
      \ D. Eisenhower at the time of his death. So I need to figure out both of their\
      \ ages at death and then compare them.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basic info\
      \ about both people. Stanley Kubrick was a famous film director, known for movies\
      \ like 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining. Dwight D. Eisenhower was a U.S.\
      \ president and a five-star general during WWII. \n\nOkay, next step: find their\
      \ birth years and death years. For Stanley Kubrick, I think he died in the late\
      \ 90s or early 2000s. Wait, wasn't his last film Eyes Wide Shut released in\
      \ 1999? And he died around that time. So maybe he died in 1999. His birth year...\
      \ I think he was born in 1928. Let me verify that in my mind. Yes, Kubrick was\
      \ born on July 26, 1928, and he died on March 7, 1999. So to calculate his age\
      \ at death: 1999 minus 1928. That would be 70 years old, but since his birthday\
      \ is in July and he died in March, he was still 70? Wait, 1999 minus 1928 is\
      \ 71, but since he died before his birthday in July, he would be 70 years old.\
      \ Hmm, let's check: 1928 + 70 = 1998, so by July 1998 he would be 70. Then from\
      \ July 1998 to March 1999, he would be 70 years old until his next birthday.\
      \ Wait, no, if he was born in 1928, then in March 1999, he hadn't turned 71\
      \ yet because his birthday is in July. So his age at death would be 70 years\
      \ old. Wait, maybe I should do the exact calculation. From July 26, 1928, to\
      \ March 7, 1999. So that's 70 years, 7 months, and some days. So in terms of\
      \ years, he was 70 years old at death.\n\nNow, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was\
      \ the 34th president, served from 1953 to 1961. His birth year... he was born\
      \ in 1890, I think. October 14, 1890. And he died in 1969. Let me confirm, yes,\
      \ Eisenhower died on March 28, 1969. So his age at death would be 1969 minus\
      \ 1890. That's 79 years. But again, checking the exact dates: born October 14,\
      \ 1890, died March 28, 1969. So from October 14, 1890, to October 14, 1968,\
      \ he was 78. Then from October 14, 1968, to March 28, 1969, he was 79, but he\
      \ died before his next birthday in October. Wait, no. Wait, if he was born in\
      \ 1890, then by 1969, he would have been 79 years old. Let me calculate: 1969\
      \ minus 1890 equals 79. But since he died in March, which is before October,\
      \ he was 78 years old at death. Wait, that's conflicting. Let's do the exact\
      \ math. If he was born on October 14, 1890, then on October 14, 1968, he turned\
      \ 78. Then from October 14, 1968, to March 28, 1969, that's 5 months and 14\
      \ days. So he was 78 years old, and died before reaching 79. So his age at death\
      \ would be 78? Wait, no, because when someone is born in 1890, and dies in 1969,\
      \ their age is 1969 - 1890 = 79 years, but if the death is before the birthday,\
      \ you subtract 1. So 79 minus 1 is 78. So he was 78 years old when he died.\
      \ Wait, but sometimes people calculate it as the age reached on the last birthday.\
      \ So if he hadn't turned 79 yet, he's 78. So Eisenhower was 78, Kubrick was\
      \ 70. Therefore, yes, Kubrick was younger at death than Eisenhower. Wait, but\
      \ wait, I think I might have gotten their ages wrong. Let me double-check.\n\
      \nStanley Kubrick: born 1928, died 1999. 1999 - 1928 = 71. But he died in March\
      \ 1928 + 71 = 1999. Wait, that's confusing. If he was born in 1928, then in\
      \ 1999 he would have turned 71 only if his birthday had passed. Since he died\
      \ in March 1999 and his birthday is in July, he was 70 years old. Because from\
      \ July 26, 1928, to July 26, 1998, he was 70. Then from July 26, 1998, to March\
      \ 7, 1999, he was still 70. So 70 years old at death.\n\nEisenhower: born 1890,\
      \ died 1969. 1969 - 1890 = 79. But his birthday is in October. So he died in\
      \ March 1969, which is before October 14, 1969. So he was 78 years old when\
      \ he died. Because from October 14, 1890, to October 14, 1968, he was 78. Then\
      \ he died in March 1969, which is 5 months before his 79th birthday, so he was\
      \ 78. Wait, but some sources might just subtract the years, leading to 79, but\
      \ the correct way is to count the completed years. So if he was 78 years and\
      \ 5 months old, then his age at death is 78. However, sometimes in obituaries,\
      \ they might say 78, but official records might sometimes list it as 79 if they\
      \ count the years without considering the exact date. But I think the accurate\
      \ way is 78. Let me check: For example, if someone is born in October 1890 and\
      \ dies in March 1969, they have not had their 79th birthday yet. So their age\
      \ is 78. So Eisenhower was 78, Kubrick was 70. Therefore, yes, Kubrick was younger\
      \ at death than Eisenhower. So the answer is YES.\n</think>Stanley Kubrick was\
      \ born on July 26, 1928, and died on March 7, 1999. At his death, he was 70\

      \ 14, 1890, and died on March 28, 1969. At his death, he was 78 years old (not\
      \ yet having turned 79). Since 70 is younger than 78, **YES**, Kubrick was younger\
      \ at his time of death than Eisenhower. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    8b8915ad-f6f7-4f0b-8ca1-f097aaa99251: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Stanley Kubrick was younger when he died compared to Dwight D. Eisenhower\

      \ I should recall when each of them died. Stanley Kubrick was a film director,\
      \ known for movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining. I think he died\
      \ in the late 90s or early 2000s. Wait, wasn't it 1999? Yeah, I remember he\
      \ passed away just before the release of Eyes Wide Shut. So his death year is\
      \ 1999. Now, his birth year... He was born in 1928, I believe. So if he died\
      \ in 1999, subtracting 1928 from 1999 gives 71 years old.\n\nNow, Dwight D.\
      \ Eisenhower was the 34th U.S. President, right? He was a general in WWII and\
      \ president during the 1950s. His death year... I think he died in the late\

      \ he lived for some years. I recall he died in 1969. His birth year was 1890.\
      \ So 1969 minus 1890 is 79 years old.\n\nSo Kubrick was 71, Eisenhower was 79.\
      \ Therefore, yes, Kubrick was younger at the time of his death than Eisenhower.\
      \ Wait, but I need to make sure I have the correct dates. Let me double-check.\
      \ \n\nStanley Kubrick: Born July 26, 1928, died March 7, 1999. So 1999 - 1928\

      \ March 28, 1969. 1969 - 1890 = 79 years. \n\nYes, that's right. So 71 vs. 79.\
      \ Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>Stanley Kubrick was born in 1928 and\

    9b98d5f8-45de-46f1-85ea-29bddc82fa0e: "<think>Alright, let's see. The question\
      \ is whether Stanley Kubrick was younger at the time of his death than Dwight\
      \ D. Eisenhower when he died. Hmm, okay, step by step. First, I need to find\
      \ out the birth and death years of both individuals, then calculate their ages\
      \ at death, and compare them.\n\nStarting with Stanley Kubrick. I remember he\
      \ was a filmmaker, directed movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining.\
      \ His death... I think he died in the late 90s. Was it 1999? Yeah, March 1999.\
      \ His birth year? I think he was born in 1928. Let me confirm that. Yes, Kubrick\
      \ was born July 26, 1928, and died March 7, 1999. So to calculate his age: 1999\
      \ minus 1928. Let's subtract: 1999 - 1928 = 71 years. But wait, since his birthday\
      \ is in July and he died in March, he hadn't turned 71 yet. So he would have\
      \ been 70 years old when he died. Wait, no\u2014calculating age can be tricky.\
      \ From July 26, 1928, to March 7, 1999. Let's see: from July 1928 to July 1998\
      \ is 70 years. Then from July 1998 to March 1999 is 7 months. So he was 70 years\
      \ and about 7 months old. But in terms of age at death, he was 70 years old,\
      \ because he hadn't reached his 71st birthday yet. So Kubrick's age at death\
      \ was 70 years old.\n\nNow Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was a U.S. president, the\
      \ 34th president, served from 1953 to 1961. His death... I think he died in\
      \ 1969. Let me check his birth and death dates. Eisenhower was born on October\
      \ 14, 1890, and died on March 28, 1969. So his age at death would be 1969 minus\
      \ 1890. 1969 - 1890 = 79 years. But again, check the exact dates. From October\
      \ 14, 1890, to October 14, 1968, he would have been 78. Then from October 1968\
      \ to March 1969 is 5 months. So he was 78 years and 5 months old when he died.\
      \ Wait, but the subtraction gives 79 years? Wait, 1969 minus 1890 is 79. Because\
      \ 1890 + 79 = 1969. So regardless of the exact months, the age at death would\
      \ be 78 years if he died before his birthday in 1969. Wait, he died in March\
      \ 1969, and his birthday is in October. So he hadn't turned 79 yet. Therefore,\
      \ his age at death was 78 years and 5 months, so 78 years old. Wait, no\u2014\
      age is calculated as the number of completed years. So if he was born October\
      \ 14, 1890, then on October 14, 1968, he turned 78. He died on March 28, 1969,\
      \ which is before his 79th birthday. So his age at death is 78 years old. But\
      \ wait, wait, 1969 minus 1890 is 79. But because he died before his birthday,\
      \ he was still 78. So that's a common confusion. So his actual age was 78 years,\
      \ 5 months, and 14 days. Therefore, he was 78 when he died.\n\nSo Kubrick was\
      \ 70, Eisenhower was 78. Therefore, yes, Kubrick was younger at his time of\

      \ I might have messed up.\n\nStanley Kubrick: born July 26, 1928. Died March\
      \ 7, 1999. So from 1928 to 1999 is 71 years, but since he died in March, before\
      \ his birthday in July, he was 70 years old. Correct.\n\nEisenhower: born October\
      \ 14, 1890. Died March 28, 1969. So from 1890 to 1969 is 79 years, but he died\

      First, I should recall when each of them was born and when they died. Let''s
      start with Stanley Kubrick. I think he was a film director, known for movies
      like 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining. I remember he died in 1999, maybe
      March? As for his birth year, I think he was born in 1928. Let me check that

      he was 71 when he died.


      Now, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was a U.S. President, right? The 34th president,
      served two terms in the 1950s. He was also a general in World War II. His death
      year... I think he died in 1969. Wait, no, maybe later? Wait, he was president

      would be 1969 minus 1890. Let''s do the math: 1969 - 1890 = 79. So he was 79
      when he died.

      \ out. The question is whether John the Baptist was younger when he died than\
      \ Woodrow Wilson was when he died. I need to compare their ages at the time\
      \ of their deaths. \n\nFirst, let's start with John the Baptist. He's a biblical\
      \ figure, so getting exact dates might be tricky. From what I remember, he was\
      \ a contemporary of Jesus Christ. Since Jesus was born around 4-6 BCE (because\
      \ of the calendar mix-up), John the Baptist was probably born a little earlier,\
      \ maybe around 5-1 BCE. He was known for baptizing Jesus, which would have happened\
      \ when Jesus was about 30, so around 26-30 CE. John was executed by Herod Antipas.\
      \ The Bible doesn't give an exact age, but according to some traditions, he\
      \ was around the same age as Jesus or a bit older. If Jesus died in his early\
      \ 30s, John might have been in his early to mid-30s when he was killed. However,\
      \ some sources suggest he was older, but I think the common belief is that he\
      \ was in his 30s.\n\nNow, Woodrow Wilson. He was the 28th President of the United\
      \ States, serving from 1913 to 1921. He was born on December 28, 1856, and died\
      \ on February 3, 1924. To find his age at death, subtract 1856 from 1924. Let\
      \ me do the math: 1924 minus 1856. 1856 + 68 = 1924, so he was 67 years old\
      \ when he died. Wait, 1924 minus 1856 is 68 years, because from December 1856\
      \ to December 1924 is exactly 68 years, and he died in February, so he was 67\
      \ years and about a month old.\n\nSo, John the Baptist is estimated to have\
      \ died in his 30s, maybe around 30-35 years old. Woodrow Wilson was 67 when\
      \ he died. Therefore, John the Baptist was definitely younger at the time of\
      \ his death than Woodrow Wilson. Unless there's some historical record I'm missing\
      \ that says John lived much longer, but most accounts I know suggest his ministry\
      \ was brief and ended in his early death. So the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES.\
      \ John the Baptist is traditionally believed to have been executed in his early\
      \ to mid-30s (around 28-36 CE), while Woodrow Wilson died at age 67 in 1924.\
      \ Since 30s < 67, John the Baptist was younger at death. \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    6643a497-685c-4360-8f52-20e7093aa382: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The question is whether John the Baptist was younger at the\
      \ time of his death than Woodrow Wilson was when he died. I need to find out\
      \ the ages of both historical figures when they died and compare them.\n\nFirst,\
      \ let's start with John the Baptist. From what I remember, he's a significant\
      \ religious figure in Christianity, known for baptizing Jesus. The Bible mentions\
      \ that he was executed by Herod Antipas. To determine his age, I need to look\
      \ at historical and biblical sources. The Gospel of Luke states that John was\
      \ about six months older than Jesus. Since Jesus is traditionally believed to\
      \ have been around 30 when he began his ministry, and John started his ministry\
      \ a bit earlier, maybe John was also in his early 30s when he died. However,\
      \ the exact age isn't clearly stated in the Bible. Some traditions suggest he\
      \ was in his early 30s, possibly around the same age as Jesus, who was crucified\
      \ in his early 30s. But I might need to check more sources here.\n\nNext, Woodrow\
      \ Wilson. He was the 28th President of the United States, serving from 1913\
      \ to 1921. He was born on December 28, 1856, and died on February 3, 1924. Calculating\
      \ his age at death: 1924 minus 1856 gives 68 years. Let me confirm that. 1856\
      \ + 68 = 1924. Yes, so he was 68 when he died.\n\nNow, comparing the two. If\
      \ John the Baptist was in his early 30s, say around 30-35, and Wilson was 68,\
      \ then John was indeed younger at death. But I need to make sure about John's\
      \ age. Historical records from that time are scarce. The Bible doesn't give\
      \ exact dates, but some scholars estimate based on the timeline of Herod Antipas'\
      \ reign. Herod Antipas ruled from 4 BCE to 39 CE. John's execution is mentioned\
      \ in the Gospels, around the time of Jesus' ministry, which is generally placed\
      \ around 27-30 CE. If John was born around 5-1 BCE, he would have been in his\
      \ early 30s when he died. So approximately 30-35 years old.\n\nTherefore, John\
      \ the Baptist died around age 30-35, while Woodrow Wilson was 68. So the answer\
      \ is YES, John was younger at death.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\
      \  \n1. **John the Baptist's Age at Death:**  \n   - Biblical references suggest\
      \ he was about six months older than Jesus.  \n   - Jesus began his ministry\
      \ around age 30 (Luke 3:23), and John's ministry started slightly earlier. \
      \ \n   - John was executed during Herod Antipas' reign (4 BCE\u201339 CE), likely\
      \ around 28\u201330 CE.  \n   - Estimated birth year: ~5\u20131 BCE, making\
      \ him approximately **30\u201335 years old** at death.  \n\n2. **Woodrow Wilson's\
      \ Age at Death:**  \n   - Born December 28, 1856; died February 3, 1924.  \n\
      \   - Calculation: 1924 \u2013 1856 = **68 years old** at death.  \n\n3. **Comparison:**\
      \  \n   - John the Baptist (~30\u201335) was younger than Woodrow Wilson (68)\
      \ at their respective deaths.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"

      \ step by step. The question is whether John the Baptist was younger at the\

      \ with John the Baptist. From what I remember, he's a significant religious\
      \ figure, known for baptizing Jesus in the Jordan River. His death is described\
      \ in the Bible, specifically in the New Testament. The story goes that he was\
      \ executed by Herod Antipas, probably around 28-36 AD. But his exact birth date\
      \ isn't recorded. However, there's some context. The Gospel of Luke mentions\
      \ that John was born six months before Jesus. If Jesus was born around 4-6 BCE\
      \ (since Herod the Great, who was alive at Jesus' birth, died in 4 BCE), then\
      \ John would have been born roughly in 5-7 BCE. If John died around 30 AD, that\
      \ would make him approximately 35-37 years old. Wait, but I need to check if\
      \ that timeline adds up. If he was born in 5 BCE and died in 30 AD, that's 35\
      \ years (since there's no year 0, so from 5 BCE to 1 CE is 5 years, then 1 CE\
      \ to 30 CE is 30 years, totaling 35 years). So about mid-30s.\n\nNow, Woodrow\
      \ Wilson. He was the 28th President of the United States, serving from 1913\
      \ to 1921. He was born on December 28, 1856, and died on February 3, 1924. Let\
      \ me calculate his age at death. From 1856 to 1924 is 68 years. But since he\
      \ died in February, he had already had his birthday in December 1923. So 1924\
      \ minus 1856 is 68 years. So he was 68 when he died.\n\nComparing the two: John\
      \ the Baptist around 35 and Woodrow Wilson at 68. So YES, John the Baptist was\
      \ younger at his death than Wilson. But wait, is the timeline for John accurate?\
      \ Sometimes historical figures' dates are uncertain. John's execution is traditionally\
      \ placed around 30 AD, but some sources might say a bit earlier or later. Also,\
      \ Jesus' ministry started around when John was active, and Jesus was about 30\
      \ when he began preaching. If Jesus was born around 4 BCE, he'd be about 30\
      \ in 26-27 AD. John was born six months earlier, so maybe 6 months older. If\
      \ Jesus died around 30-33 AD, John's death would be a bit before that. Herod\
      \ Antipas ruled until 39 AD, but the execution of John is linked to the Gospels'\
      \ accounts. So even if John died in, say, 32 AD, he'd still be around 36-38\
      \ years old. Still way younger than Wilson's 68. Therefore, the answer should\
      \ be YES.\n</think>YES  \nJohn the Baptist is traditionally believed to have\
      \ been executed around 28\u201336 CE, with estimated birth around 5\u20137 BCE,\
      \ making him approximately 35\u201337 years old at death. Woodrow Wilson died\
      \ at age 68 in 1924. Since 35\u201337 is younger than 68, John the Baptist was\
      \ indeed younger at his death than Woodrow Wilson."

      \ with John the Baptist. From what I remember, he was a religious figure in\
      \ the New Testament, baptizing Jesus. His death is mentioned in the Bible, where\
      \ Herod Antipas had him executed. I think the story says that Herodias' daughter\
      \ Salome danced for Herod, who promised her anything, and at her mother's urging,\
      \ she asked for John's head on a platter. So, when did this happen? \n\nJohn\
      \ was a contemporary of Jesus, right? Jesus started his ministry around age\
      \ 30, and John was already active before that. The Bible doesn't give exact\
      \ birth dates, but traditionally, John is considered to be about six months\
      \ older than Jesus. If Jesus was around 33 when he was crucified, then John\
      \ would have been around 33 or 34 when he died. But wait, John was executed\
      \ before Jesus. The Gospels mention that John was imprisoned and then beheaded\
      \ during Jesus' ministry. So if Jesus was preaching for about three years, John's\
      \ death would have been a couple of years before Jesus' crucifixion. That would\
      \ make John's age at death maybe around 30-33 years old. But I'm not entirely\
      \ sure; maybe some sources have different estimates.\n\nNow, Woodrow Wilson.\
      \ He was the 28th President of the United States, serving from 1913 to 1921.\
      \ Let's check his birth and death dates. Woodrow Wilson was born on December\
      \ 28, 1856, and died on February 3, 1924. So to calculate his age at death:\
      \ 1924 minus 1856. Let's do the math. 1924 - 1856 = 68 years. So Wilson was\
      \ 68 years old when he died.\n\nComparing the two: John the Baptist is estimated\
      \ to have died in his early 30s, maybe up to mid-30s. Wilson was 68. So unless\
      \ there's some historical record that John was older, which I don't recall,\
      \ the answer should be yes, John was younger at death than Wilson.\n\nWait,\
      \ but is the estimate for John the Baptist's age reliable? Since there's no\
      \ exact records, some scholars might have different opinions. But the general\
      \ consensus is that he was executed in his early 30s. So I think the answer\

      \ The question is whether John the Baptist was younger when he died than Woodrow\

      First, I should find out when each of them died and their birth years. Let's\
      \ start with John the Baptist. He's a biblical figure, so exact dates might\
      \ be tricky. From what I remember, he was a contemporary of Jesus, and Jesus\
      \ was born around 4-6 BCE. John the Baptist is said to be a few months older\
      \ than Jesus. So if Jesus was about 30 when he started his ministry, John would\
      \ have been around the same age. But when did John die? The Bible says he was\
      \ executed by Herod Antipas. Herod Antipas ruled from 4 BCE to 39 CE. The execution\
      \ is mentioned in the Gospels, around the time of Jesus' ministry. So maybe\
      \ John died around 30-33 CE. If he was born around 5 BCE, that would make him\

      \ Some sources might say different, but I think that's the general consensus.\n\
      \nNow, Woodrow Wilson. He was a US president. Let me recall his dates. He was\

      \ was born December 28, 1856, and died February 3, 1924. So to calculate his\
      \ age at death: 1924 minus 1856 is 68 years. So he was 68 when he died.\n\n\
      Comparing the two: John the Baptist, if he died around 30 CE and was born around\
      \ 5 BCE, that's 35 years (since from 5 BCE to 1 CE is 5 years, then 30 CE is\
      \ another 30, totaling 35). So 35 vs. 68. That would mean John was younger.\

    0c9bf55a-fba0-460c-80b6-55ae547bf06a: '<think>Alright, let''s tackle this question.
      So, the question is whether Andy Warhol was younger at his time of death than
      Fidel Castro at his time of death. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure out the
      birth and death years of both individuals and then calculate their ages at death
      to compare.


      Let me start with Andy Warhol. I remember he was a prominent figure in the pop
      art movement. I think he died in the late 80s. Wait, wasn''t there something
      about him passing away in 1987? Yeah, that sounds right. As for his birth year,
      I believe he was born in the late 1920s. Let me confirm: Andy Warhol was born
      on August 6, 1928. So if he died in 1987, his age at death would be 1987 minus
      1928. Let me do that math: 1987 - 1928 = 59. So he was 59 years old when he
      died.


      Now, Fidel Castro. He was the Cuban revolutionary leader and president. I know
      he lived a long life. He died more recently, right? I think he passed away in
      2016. Let me check: Fidel Castro died on November 25, 2016. His birth date was
      August 13, 1926. So calculating his age at death: 2016 minus 1926. That would
      be 90 years old. Wait, 2016 - 1926 is 90. So he was 90 when he died.


      Comparing the two: Andy Warhol was 59, Fidel Castro was 90. So yes, Warhol was
      younger at the time of his death than Castro. Therefore, the answer should be
      YES.

      </think>Andy Warhol was born on August 6, 1928, and died on February 22, 1987,
      at age 58. Fidel Castro was born on August 13, 1926, and died on November 25,
      2016, at age 90. Since 58 (Warhol) is less than 90 (Castro), the answer is YES.

      wasn't there a documentary mentioning he died in 1987? Yeah, I think that's\
      \ right. So Andy Warhol was born in 1928 and died in 1987. That would make him\
      \ 59 years old when he died. Let me check that math: 1987 minus 1928 is 59.\

      \ took place in 1959. If he was born in 1926, then he would have been around\
      \ 33 when he came to power. Now, when did he die? I remember hearing that Fidel\
      \ Castro died in 2016. So if he was born in 1926 and died in 2016, his age at\
      \ death would be 2016 minus 1926. Let's do the calculation: 2016 minus 1926\

    bff4a84c-0bf1-4da8-a8fc-cda593418b13: '<think>Alright, let''s tackle this question
      step by step. So, the question is whether Andy Warhol was younger at the time
      of his death than Fidel Castro was at his own death. To figure this out, I need
      to find out both of their birth years and death years, calculate their ages
      at the time of death, and then compare them.


      First, I''ll start with Andy Warhol. I remember that he was a prominent artist
      in the pop art movement. I think he died in the late 80s or early 90s. Let me
      confirm that. If I recall correctly, Andy Warhol was born in 1928. Wait, was
      it 1930? No, I think it''s 1928. Let me check mentally. He was part of the 60s
      pop art scene, so being born in the late 20s would make him in his 30s then.
      His death, I believe, was in 1987. So if he was born in 1928 and died in 1987,
      that would make him 59 years old. Wait, 1987 minus 1928 is 59. Yes, that''s
      right. So Andy Warhol died at age 59.


      Now, Fidel Castro. He was the Cuban revolutionary leader. He lived a long time,
      I think. When did he die? I remember it was in the 2010s, maybe 2016? Let''s
      see. Fidel Castro was born in 1926, I believe. So if he was born in 1926 and
      died in 2016, that would make him 90 years old. 2016 minus 1926 is 90. So Fidel
      Castro died at age 90.


      Comparing the two: Andy Warhol was 59 at death, Fidel Castro was 90. So yes,
      Andy Warhol was younger when he died than Fidel Castro was when he died. Therefore,
      the answer should be YES.


      Wait, let me just double-check the birth and death years to make sure I didn''t
      mix anything up. For Andy Warhol: born August 6, 1928, died February 22, 1987.
      So that''s indeed 1987 - 1928 = 59 years old. For Fidel Castro: born August
      13, 1926, died November 25, 2016. 2016 - 1926 = 90 years old. Yes, that''s correct.
      So the comparison holds. Therefore, the answer is YES.

      </think>YES. Andy Warhol was born in 1928 and died in 1987 at age 59. Fidel
      Castro was born in 1926 and died in 2016 at age 90. Since 59 is younger than
      90, the answer is YES.'

      \ step by step. The user wants to know if Andy Warhol was younger at the time\
      \ of his death than Fidel Castro was when he died. So, first, I need to find\
      \ out the birth and death years of both individuals and then calculate their\
      \ ages at death to compare them.\n\nStarting with Andy Warhol. I remember he\
      \ was a prominent figure in the pop art movement. I think he died in the late\
      \ 80s. Let me recall... Yes, Andy Warhol died in 1987. His birth year was 1928,\
      \ I believe. So if he was born in 1928 and died in 1987, subtracting 1928 from\
      \ 1987 gives his age. Let's do that math: 1987 minus 1928. 1987 - 1928 equals\
      \ 59 years old. Wait, actually, 1928 + 59 would be 1987. So yes, he was 58 or\
      \ 59? Wait, depending on the exact birth and death dates. For example, if his\
      \ birthday was in August and he died in February, he might have been 58. But\
      \ generally, sources say he was 58 when he died. Wait, let me double-check.\
      \ Andy Warhol was born on August 6, 1928, and died on February 22, 1987. So\
      \ from August 6, 1928, to February 22, 1987. Let's calculate his age. From August\
      \ 1928 to August 1986 would be 58 years. Then from August 1986 to February 1987\
      \ is 6 months. So he was 58 years and 6 months old, which would make him 58\
      \ at the time of death, not having reached 59 yet. So his age at death was 58\
      \ years.\n\nNow, Fidel Castro. He was the Cuban revolutionary leader. He lived\
      \ a long time. I think he died in 2016. Let me confirm that. Yes, Fidel Castro\

      \ his age at death: 2016 minus 1926. That's 90 years. Wait, but let's check\
      \ the exact dates. If he was born on August 13, 1926, and died on November 25,\
      \ 2016, then he would have turned 90 in August 2016. So from August 13, 2016,\
      \ to November 25, 2016, is about 3 months and 12 days. So he was 90 years and\

      \ out the answer by comparing their ages when they died.\n\nFirst off, I should\
      \ probably start by finding out when each of them was born and when they died.\
      \ That way, I can calculate their ages at the time of death and then compare\
      \ the two.\n\nStarting with Andy Warhol. From what I remember, Andy Warhol was\

      \ birth name) was born on August 6, 1928, and died on February 22, 1987. So,\
      \ to calculate his age at death, I subtract his birth year from his death year:\
      \ 1987 - 1928. That would make him 59 years old when he died. Wait, but wait\u2014\
      since his birthday is in August and he died in February, he was actually 58\
      \ years old, right? Because from August 1928 to August 1986 would be 58 years,\
      \ and then from August 1986 to February 1987 is about 6 months, so he hadn't\
      \ turned 59 yet. So he was 58 years old at the time of his death. Hmm, that's\
      \ a detail I need to get right. So 1987 minus 1928 is 59, but since he died\

      Dante Alighieri is the famous Italian poet who wrote "The Divine Comedy." I

      confirm that. Yes, Dante was born in 1265 in Florence. Now, when did he die?
      I recall he died in 1321. So that would make his age at death 56 years old,
      right? Because 1321 minus 1265 is 56. Let me check the math: 1265 + 56 = 1321.
      Yep, that adds up.


      Now, Alexandre Dumas. He''s the French writer known for "The Three Musketeers"

      1802 + 68 = 1870. Correct.


      So Dante died at 56, and Dumas at 68. Therefore, Dante was indeed younger at
      the time of his death than Dumas. So the answer should be YES. But wait, let
      me double-check the dates to be sure I didn''t mix anything up. Dante: 1265-1321

      \ I need to recall the birth and death years of both Dante and Dumas. Let's\
      \ start with Dante Alighieri. If I remember correctly, Dante was an Italian\
      \ poet from the late Middle Ages, famous for \"The Divine Comedy.\" I think\
      \ he was born around the mid-13th century. Maybe 1265? And he died in 1321.\
      \ Let me confirm that. Yes, Dante was born in 1265 and died in 1321. To calculate\

      \ Dante Alighieri was younger when he died compared to Alexandre Dumas. Let\
      \ me start by recalling their birth and death years. \n\nFirst, Dante Alighieri.\
      \ I think he was from the medieval period. I remember he wrote the Divine Comedy.\
      \ His dates... wasn't he born around 1265 and died in 1321? Let me check that.\
      \ If he was born in 1265 and died in 1321, then his age at death would be 1321\
      \ minus 1265. Let me calculate that: 1321 minus 1260 is 61, so minus another\
      \ 5 would make him 56? Wait, no. Wait, 1265 plus 56 would be 1321? Let me do\

      \ I think he was born in 1802 and died in 1870. Let me confirm those dates.\

      \ Matisse was younger. So the answer is still YES. But wait, some sources might\
      \ just take the year difference. Let me check a reliable source. \n\nAccording\
      \ to my knowledge, Matisse was born in 1869 and died in 1954. So 1954 minus\
      \ 1869 is 85. However, if his birthday is late in the year and he died before\
      \ it, he would be 84. But I need to confirm the exact age. Let me think. December\
      \ 31, 1869, to November 3, 1954. So that is 84 years, 10 months, and 3 days.\
      \ So he was 84. So perhaps the correct age is 84. But sometimes, when people\
      \ state the age at death, they might count the years as the difference minus\
      \ one if the birthday hadn't occurred yet. However, historically, most sources\
      \ I remember state that Matisse died at 84, or 85. Wait, maybe I should verify.\
      \ \n\nLooking it up mentally, I think some sources say Matisse died at 84. For\
      \ instance, he was born in 1869, died in 1954. 1954 - 1869 is 85, but since\
      \ his birthday is December 31, he died in November, so he hadn't turned 85 yet.\
      \ Therefore, he was 84. So if that's the case, then he was 84. Nelson Mandela\
      \ was born in 1918, died 2013. 2013 - 1918 = 95. So 84 vs. 95. Therefore, Matisse\
      \ was younger. So yes, the answer is YES. \n\nWait, but if the question is phrased\
      \ as \"younger at their time of death\", then even if Matisse was 85, which\
      \ is less than 95, the answer is still YES. But perhaps there's confusion about\
      \ their exact ages. Let me make sure. Wait, another way: if Matisse was born\
      \ 1869, died 1954, his age is 85 if he lived past his birthday in 1954. But\
      \ he died in November 1954, and his birthday was December 31. Therefore, he\
      \ would not have turned 85 yet. So his exact age was 84. So perhaps the correct\
      \ age is 84. But I need to confirm this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the standard\
      \ cited age is 85. For example, sometimes in biographies, the age is calculated\
      \ as the year of death minus the year of birth, which would give 85. However,\
      \ technically, if the person hasn't had their birthday yet in the year of death,\
      \ it's one less. So it's 84. The answer might hinge on that. But given that\
      \ the question is probably expecting the standard answer, assuming that the\
      \ age is calculated as death year minus birth year, even if the birthday hadn't\
      \ occurred yet. But that's not accurate. \n\nBut in reality, calculating a person's\
      \ age requires the exact dates. So, let's confirm. Henri Matisse was born on\
      \ December 31, 1869, and died on November 3, 1954. So from December 31, 1869,\
      \ to November 3, 1954. Let's compute the exact age. \n\nHe lived from 1869 to\
      \ 1954: that's 85 years, but he died two months before his 85th birthday. So\
      \ he was 84 years old. Therefore, his age at death was 84. \n\nNelson Mandela\
      \ was born on July 18, 1918, and died on December 5, 2013. So from July 18,\
      \ 1918, to December 5, 2013. 2013 - 1918 = 95 years. But since his death was\
      \ in December, after his birthday in July, he had already turned 95. So his\
      \ exact age was 95 years, 4 months, and 17 days. So he was 95. \n\nTherefore,\
      \ Matisse was 84, Mandela 95. So Matisse was younger when he died. Hence, the\
      \ answer is YES.\n</think>Henri Matisse was born on December 31, 1869, and died\
      \ on November 3, 1954, making him **84 years old** at his death (as he died\

      \ on December 5, 2013, at **95 years old** (having already celebrated his birthday\

      \ artist, famous for his use of color and his role in the Fauvism movement.\
      \ I think he lived in the late 19th and early to mid-20th century. If I remember\

      \ contemporary of Picasso, who lived much longer, but Matisse's death was in\
      \ the mid-50s. Let me verify that mentally. Yes, 1869-1954 would make him 85\
      \ when he died. Wait, 1954 minus 1869 is 85 years old. Okay, so if that's correct,\
      \ Matisse was 85 at death.\n\nNow, Nelson Mandela. He's more modern. He was\
      \ a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary and politician who became president.\
      \ I know he was imprisoned for a long time, 27 years, and was released in 1990.\
      \ He became president in 1994 and served until 1999. His death was more recent.\
      \ I think he died in 2013. Let me recall his birth year. Mandela was born in\
      \ 1918, I believe. So if he died in 2013, that would make him 95 years old.\
      \ 2013 minus 1918 is 95. Wait, that seems right. I remember he had a long life,\
      \ passing away at 95.\n\nSo comparing the two: Matisse died at 85, Mandela at\
      \ 95. Therefore, Matisse was younger at the time of his death than Mandela.\
      \ So the answer would be YES, Matisse was younger when he died compared to Mandela.\n\
      \nBut wait, let me double-check the birth and death years to make sure I didn't\
      \ mix up anything. For Henri Matisse: Born December 31, 1869, died November\
      \ 3, 1954. That's correct. 1954 - 1869 = 85 years. Nelson Mandela: Born July\

      \ a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary and politician who served as\
      \ President. He was born on July 18, 1918, and died on December 5, 2013. Let's\

      \ Let me start with C.S. Lewis. I think he was born in 1898. Wait, wasn't he\
      \ a contemporary of J.R.R. Tolkien? Tolkien was born in 1892, and I believe\

      \ When did he die? I remember he died the same day as Aldous Huxley and JFK\

      \ step by step. The question is asking whether C.S. Lewis was younger at the\
      \ time of his death than Carl Jung was when he died. To answer this, I need\
      \ to find out the birth and death years of both individuals and then calculate\
      \ their ages at death. \n\nFirst, I need to recall or look up the dates for\
      \ C.S. Lewis. From what I remember, C.S. Lewis was a British writer and scholar,\
      \ known for works like \"The Chronicles of Narnia.\" I think he died in the\
      \ 1960s. Wait, wasn't he a contemporary of J.R.R. Tolkien? Yes, and I believe\
      \ he passed away on the same day as Aldous Huxley and John F. Kennedy, which\
      \ was November 22, 1963. So his death year is 1963. Now, his birth year... I\
      \ think he was born in 1898. Let me verify that. If he died in 1963 at, say,\
      \ 64 years old, then 1963 minus 64 would be 1899, but maybe I'm mixing up the\
      \ exact age. Alternatively, I might recall that he was born on November 29,\
      \ 1898. So if he died in 1963, that would make him 64 years old (since 1963\
      \ - 1898 = 65, but since his birthday is in November and he died in November,\
      \ if he died before his birthday, he would be 64. Wait, November 22 is before\
      \ November 29, so he died 7 days before his 65th birthday. Therefore, he was\
      \ 64 years old at death.\n\nNext, Carl Jung. He was a Swiss psychiatrist and\
      \ psychoanalyst, founder of analytical psychology. I think he lived longer than\
      \ Lewis. His death year might be in the 1960s as well. Wait, Jung died in 1961,\
      \ I believe. Let me check. Yes, Carl Jung died on June 6, 1961. His birth year\
      \ was 1875. So calculating his age: 1961 minus 1875 equals 86 years old. So\
      \ he was 86 when he died.\n\nNow, comparing the two: C.S. Lewis was 64, Carl\

      \ The question is whether C.S. Lewis was younger at his time of death than Carl\

      \ for both of them, calculate their ages at death, and then compare.\n\nFirst,\
      \ I'll start with C.S. Lewis. From what I remember, he was a British writer,\
      \ known for the Narnia books. I think he died in the 1960s. Let me recall, maybe\
      \ around 1963? His birth year... I think he was born in 1898. So if he died\
      \ in 1963, subtracting 1898 from 1963 gives 65 years old. Wait, but I'm not\
      \ 100% sure about those dates. Maybe I should double-check mentally. Let me\
      \ think, J.R.R. Tolkien was a contemporary, and Lewis was a bit younger than\
      \ Tolkien, who was born in 1892. So if Lewis was born in 1898, that makes sense.\
      \ And his death was around the same time as JFK's assassination, which was in\

      \ 1961, 1961 minus 1875 equals 86 years old. That seems plausible because Jung\
      \ lived a long life. Let me verify: Jung was a contemporary of Freud, who was\
      \ born in 1856, so Jung being born in 1875 makes sense as Freud was older. Jung's\
      \ death year, yes, 1961. So 86 years old at death.\n\nComparing the two: C.S.\

      \ old? Wait, wait, because his birthday is in November. If he died in November\

      \ 1900, so 63 + 2 = 65. But because he died before his birthday, he was 64.\

    f77896e1-f5e4-46bc-8b23-ae218c9e0abe: '<think>Alright, let''s see. The question
      is whether C.S. Lewis was younger at the time of his death than Carl Jung was
      when he died. Hmm, okay, I need to figure out the birth and death years for
      both of them and then compare their ages.


      First, I should recall some basic facts about these two. C.S. Lewis is the author
      of the Narnia books, right? And Carl Jung was a famous psychologist, a contemporary
      of Freud but later split from him. Let me think about their lifespans.


      Starting with C.S. Lewis. I think he died in the 1960s. Was it 1963? And he
      was born around the late 1800s. Wait, maybe 1898? Let me confirm. Yes, I remember
      that C.S. Lewis was born on November 29, 1898, and he died on November 22, 1963.
      So that would make him 65 years old when he died, because 1963 minus 1898 is
      65. Wait, but wait, he died just a week before his 65th birthday. So his exact
      age would be 64 years old at death, right? Because he died in November 1963,
      and his birthday is also in November. So 1963 minus 1898 is 65, but since he
      hadn''t reached his birthday in 1963 yet (he died on the 22nd, his birthday
      is the 29th), then he was 64 years, 11 months, and some days old. But typically,
      when calculating age, if the death occurs before the birthday in that year,
      you subtract one. So his age at death would be 64.


      Now, Carl Jung. I know he lived longer. He was born in 1875, I believe. Let
      me check. Carl Gustav Jung was born on July 26, 1875, and died on June 6, 1961.
      So, calculating his age at death: 1961 minus 1875 is 86 years. But again, his
      birthday is in July, and he died in June 1961, so he hadn''t turned 86 yet.
      So his age would be 85 years old at death. Wait, 1961 minus 1875 equals 86,
      but since he died before his birthday in 1961, he was 85 years old. Wait, wait,
      no. Let me recalculate. If he was born in 1875, then from 1875 to 1961 is 86
      years. But he died on June 6, 1961, and his birthday is July 26. So as of June
      6, 1961, he was 85 years and however many months. So his age at death would
      be 85 years. But sometimes people might round up, but technically, he was 85
      years old.


      So, comparing the two: C.S. Lewis was 64 when he died in 1963, and Carl Jung
      was 85 when he died in 1961. Therefore, C.S. Lewis was younger at his time of
      death than Jung. Wait, but wait, Jung died in 1961, two years before Lewis.
      So, even though Lewis died later, his age was 64, and Jung was 85. So yes, Lewis
      was younger when he died. Therefore, the answer is YES.

      </think>C.S. Lewis was born on November 29, 1898, and died on November 22, 1963,
      at age 64 (just shy of his 65th birthday). Carl Jung was born on July 26, 1875,
      and died on June 6, 1961, at age 85 (before his 86th birthday). Since 64 is
      younger than 85, **YES**, C.S. Lewis was younger at his time of death than Carl
      Jung.'

      \ and when they died. Let me start with Ferdinand Marcos. From what I remember,\
      \ he was a former president of the Philippines. I think he was in power for\
      \ a long time, maybe during the 70s and 80s. His death... wasn't that in the\
      \ late 80s? I'm not too sure. Oh wait, Marcos died in 1989. Now, his birth year.\
      \ Let me think. I recall him being born in 1917. So if he died in 1989, subtract\
      \ 1917 from 1989. That would make him 72 years old when he died. Wait, 1989\

      \ right.\n\nNow for Robert Kennedy. He's one of the Kennedy brothers, right?\
      \ The younger brother of JFK. He was a senator and was assassinated. When did\
      \ he die? I think it was in 1968, after JFK's assassination in 1963. Robert\

      \ he hadn't turned 43 yet. Wait, no: November 20, 1925 to June 6, 1968. So from\

      \ From November 20, 1925, to November 20, 1967, he was 42. Then from November\

    6b38eb1a-172b-4e6f-b05d-bf6387093f3c: '<think>Okay, let me try to figure this
      out. The question is whether Ferdinand Marcos was younger when he died compared
      to Robert Kennedy when he died. Hmm, I need to find out their birth years and
      their death years, calculate their ages at death, and then compare them.


      First, Ferdinand Marcos. I remember he was a president of the Philippines. Let
      me recall: he was in power for a long time, up until the 1980s. When did he
      die? I think he died in exile, maybe in the late 80s. I think he was born in
      the early 20th century. Wait, maybe 1917? And died in 1989. Let me check that.
      If he was born in 1917 and died in 1989, then his age at death would be 1989
      - 1917 = 72 years.


      Now, Robert Kennedy. He was a U.S. senator and attorney general, brother of
      JFK. He was assassinated, right? That was in 1968. When was he born? I think
      he was born in 1925. So if he was born in 1925 and died in 1968, that would
      make him 43 years old at the time of his death. Wait, 1968 minus 1925 is 43.


      So, comparing the two: Ferdinand Marcos would be 72, Robert Kennedy 43. So the
      question is, was Marcos younger than Kennedy when he died? No, because 72 is
      older than 43. So the answer should be NO. But wait, am I remembering the dates
      correctly? Let me double-check.


      Another way: Marcos was president until 1986 when he was ousted. If he died
      in 1989, that''s three years later. If he was born in 1917, then yes, 1989 -
      1917 is 72. Robert Kennedy was born November 20, 1925, died June 6, 1968. So
      1968 - 1925 is indeed 43. So 43 is younger than 72. Therefore, Marcos was OLDER
      when he died. So the answer is NO, he was not younger. The answer is NO.

      </think>NO. Ferdinand Marcos was born on September 11, 1917, and died on September
      28, 1989, making him 72 at his death. Robert F. Kennedy was born on November
      20, 1925, and died on June 6, 1968, at age 42. Marcos was older than Kennedy

      \ is in November and he died in June, he hadn't turned 43 yet. So from November\
      \ 20, 1925 to November 20, 1967 is 42 years. Then from November 1967 to June\
      \ 1968 is about 6 months and 14 days (counting from November 20 to June 6).\
      \ So he was 42 years old when he died, and about 6 months into his 43rd year.\
      \ Wait, but the exact calculation might be needed here.\n\nWait, perhaps more\
      \ accurately: subtract the birth year from the death year: 1968 - 1925 = 43.\
      \ But if he hadn't had his birthday yet in 1968, we subtract one year. His birthday\
      \ is November 20. Since he died on June 6, which is before November 20, he was\
      \ 42 years old at the time of death. So 42 years, 6 months, and some days. So\
      \ age 42.\n\nTherefore, Marcos died at 72, Kennedy at 42. Therefore, Marcos\
      \ was older when he died than Kennedy. So the answer would be NO, because the\
      \ question asks if Marcos was younger than Kennedy at their respective times\
      \ of death. But Kennedy was 42, Marcos 72. So Marcos was older. Hence, the answer\
      \ is NO.\n</think>Ferdinand Marcos was born on September 11, 1917, and died\

      \ his 43rd birthday, he was **42 years old** at death. Marcos was older than\
      \ Kennedy at the time of their deaths. \n\n**ANSWER: NO**"

      \ I think in the late 80s. His birth year might be around 1917? Let me check.\
      \ Yes, Marcos was born on September 11, 1917. He died on September 28, 1989.\
      \ So to calculate his age at death: 1989 minus 1917 is 72 years. But since his\

      \ So, the question is whether Sitting Bull was younger at the time of his death\

      \ the birth and death years of both individuals and then calculate their ages\
      \ at death to compare.\n\nStarting with Sitting Bull. I remember he was a Native\
      \ American leader, specifically a Hunkpapa Lakota chief. He's famous for his\
      \ role in the Battle of Little Bighorn. Now, when did he die? I think he was\
      \ killed in 1890. As for his birth year, I'm a bit fuzzy. I believe he was born\
      \ around 1831. Let me confirm that. If he was born in 1831 and died in 1890,\
      \ that would make him 59 years old at death. Wait, 1890 minus 1831 is 59. Yeah,\
      \ that seems right. I think that's correct.\n\nNow, Lewis Carroll. He's the\
      \ author of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\" His real name was Charles\
      \ Lutwidge Dodgson. When did he die? I recall he was a Victorian author, so\
      \ late 19th century. I think he died in 1898. His birth year was 1832. So, 1898\
      \ minus 1832 would be 66 years old. Let me check that math. 1832 plus 66 is\
      \ 1898, yes. So, Lewis Carroll was 66 when he died.\n\nComparing the two: Sitting\

      \ the time of his death than Lewis Carroll. Wait, but I should make sure I have\
      \ the correct dates. Let me double-check. \n\nSitting Bull: Born in 1831, died\
      \ December 15, 1890. So 1890 - 1831 = 59. Correct. Lewis Carroll: Born January\
      \ 27, 1832, died January 14, 1898. So, 1898 - 1832 is 66, but since his birthday\
      \ was in January and he died in January, but before his birthday in 1898 (since\
      \ he died on the 14th and was born on the 27th), he was 65 years and 352 days\
      \ old. Wait, that's almost 66, but technically 65. Hmm, but usually, when calculating\
      \ age at death, it's the year of death minus year of birth, adjusted if the\
      \ birthday hadn't occurred yet. So, since he died in January 1898, and was born\
      \ in January 1832, he would have turned 66 on January 27, 1898, but he died\
      \ on January 14, so he was still 65. Wait, that's a problem. So maybe my initial\
      \ calculation was wrong. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf Lewis Carroll was born in\
      \ 1832, and died in 1898, but before his birthday, then his age would be 1898\
      \ - 1832 - 1 = 65. Because he hadn't turned 66 yet. So, he was 65 when he died.\
      \ But I thought he was 66. Maybe I need to check exact dates. Let's see. His\
      \ date of birth is January 27, 1832. Date of death is January 14, 1898. So from\
      \ January 27, 1832, to January 27, 1898, would be 66 years. But he died 13 days\
      \ before his 66th birthday. Therefore, his age at death was 65 years, 11 months,\
      \ and about 2 weeks. So, in terms of years, he was 65 years old. Therefore,\
      \ if Sitting Bull was 59 and Lewis Carroll was 65, then the answer is still\
      \ yes, Sitting Bull was younger. But wait, maybe some sources round up. Let\
      \ me check a reliable source. \n\nLooking up Lewis Carroll's death, he was born\
      \ in 1832 and died in 1898. The exact age would be 65 years, 11 months, and\
      \ 18 days. So, 65 years old. Therefore, Sitting Bull at 59 is younger. So the\

      \ Let me confirm. Charles Dodgson was born on January 27, 1832, and died on\

      \ of weeks short of his 66th birthday. But still, he was 65 years old at the\

      \ his age at death: 1898 minus 1832. Wait, but he died in January 1898, so he\
      \ was 66 years old? Let's do the math. From January 27, 1832 to January 14,\
      \ 1898. So he was just a few days short of his 66th birthday. So 65 years old.\
      \ Wait, no. Wait, 1898 minus 1832 is 66, but since he died before his birthday\
      \ in 1898, he would be 65 years old. Because he was born in 1832, so in 1898\
      \ he would turn 66, but he died in January before his birthday. So 65 years\
      \ old.\n\nWait, let me check again. If he was born in 1832 and died in 1898,\
      \ the difference is 66 years. But since he died before his birthday in 1898,\
      \ he was 65 years and 11 months or something. So his age at death was 65 years\
      \ old. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's do exact calculation. From January\
      \ 27, 1832 to January 14, 1898. So that's 65 years and 363 days. So 65 years\
      \ old. So Lewis Carroll was 65 when he died, and Sitting Bull was 59. So Sitting\
      \ Bull was younger at the time of death. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>Sitting\
      \ Bull was born in 1831 and died in 1890 at age 59. Lewis Carroll (born 1832)\

    babbe8b4-3ea0-4251-b31f-d9c761452e1e: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the question is whether Sitting Bull was younger at the time of his death\
      \ than Lewis Carroll was when he died. Hmm, okay, so I need to find out both\
      \ their birth and death years and then calculate their ages at death to compare\
      \ them.\n\nFirst, I should recall who these people were. Sitting Bull was a\
      \ Native American leader, specifically a Hunkpapa Lakota chief who was involved\
      \ in the resistance against U.S. policies. Lewis Carroll, on the other hand,\
      \ was the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, the English writer famous for\
      \ \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\" \n\nNow, let's get their birth and death\
      \ dates. I think Sitting Bull died in the late 19th century. Maybe during the\
      \ 1890s? There was the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876, and he was a prominent\
      \ figure then. I believe he died in 1890. As for his birth year, I'm not exactly\
      \ sure, but I recall that he was born around 1831. Let me check that\u2014yes,\
      \ I think he was born in 1831. So if he died in 1890, he would be 59 years old\
      \ (1890 - 1831 = 59).\n\nNow, Lewis Carroll. He's a bit later, right? He was\
      \ a Victorian author. His most famous work was published in 1865. So he was\
      \ alive in the mid-19th century. Let me think about his dates. I think he was\
      \ born in 1832 and died in 1898. So if he was born in 1832 and died in 1898,\
      \ his age at death would be 1898 - 1832 = 66 years old.\n\nWait, but wait. Let\
      \ me make sure I have the correct years. Sitting Bull: born 1831, died December\
      \ 15, 1890. So 1890 - 1831 is indeed 59. Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) was\
      \ born January 27, 1832, died January 14, 1898. So subtracting 1832 from 1898\
      \ gives 66 years, but since he died in January 1898, just shy of his 66th birthday,\
      \ so he was 65 years old? Wait, no: 1832 to 1898 is 66 years, but since he died\
      \ before his birthday in 1898 (which is in January), he was 65 when he died.\
      \ Wait, let's calculate it properly. From January 27, 1832, to January 14, 1898:\
      \ that's 65 years and 353 days, so 65 years old. So maybe I was wrong earlier.\
      \ Let me check exact dates.\n\nSitting Bull: born c. 1831, died December 15,\
      \ 1890. If he was born in March 1831 (exact birthdate is uncertain, but often\
      \ cited as around March 1831), then in 1890, he would be 59 years old. Lewis\
      \ Carroll: born January 27, 1832, died January 14, 1898. So from 1832 to 1898\
      \ is 66 years, but since he died in January 1898 before his birthday, he was\
      \ 65 years old. Wait, no: 1832 to 1898 is 66 years, but since he hadn't reached\
      \ his birthday in 1898, he was 65. So age is 65.\n\nWait, this might be a point\
      \ of confusion. Let's compute the exact age. If someone is born on January 27,\
      \ 1832, and dies on January 14, 1898, how old are they? The difference in years\
      \ is 1898 - 1832 = 66 years. But because the death date is 13 days before the\
      \ birthday, they would be 65 years and 352 days old. So technically, 65 years\
      \ old. So Lewis Carroll was 65 when he died. Sitting Bull was 59. Therefore,\
      \ Sitting Bull was younger at the time of his death than Lewis Carroll. So the\
      \ answer is YES.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm the exact birth and death years\
      \ again. Sitting Bull's birth is often listed as 1831, and he died in 1890.\
      \ So 59. Carroll's death in 1898 at age 65. So yes, 59 vs. 65, so Sitting Bull\
      \ was younger. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>Sitting Bull was born\
      \ around 1831 and died in 1890, making him approximately **59 years old** at\
      \ his death. Lewis Carroll (born 1832) died in 1898, and since he passed away\
      \ just before his 66th birthday, he was **65 years old** at death. \n\n**ANSWER:\

    47551e7b-90b0-4099-940c-ea6780ebe551: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the question is asking if Manfred von Richthofen was younger at the time\
      \ of his death than Audrey Hepburn when she died. The answer needs to be a simple\
      \ YES or NO, but I need to work through the steps to figure it out.\n\nFirst,\
      \ I need to recall the birth and death years for both individuals. Let's start\
      \ with Manfred von Richthofen, also known as the Red Baron. I remember he was\
      \ a famous World War I fighter pilot. From what I've learned before, he was\
      \ born in 1892. He died during the war, I think in 1918. Let me confirm that.\
      \ Yes, he was born on May 2, 1892, and died on April 21, 1918. So, calculating\
      \ his age at death: 1918 minus 1892 gives 26 years. But wait, he died in April,\
      \ and his birthday is in May, so he was actually 25 years old when he died,\
      \ right? Because he hadn't turned 26 yet. So his age would be 25 years and 11\
      \ months or so. So approximately 25 years old at death.\n\nNow, Audrey Hepburn.\
      \ She was a famous actress, I believe from the mid-20th century. I think she\
      \ died in the 1990s. Let me recall. Audrey Hepburn was born on May 4, 1929,\
      \ and she passed away on January 20, 1993. Calculating her age at death: 1993\
      \ minus 1929 is 64. But she died in January, and her birthday is in May, so\
      \ she was 63 years old at the time of her death, right? Because she hadn't turned\
      \ 64 yet. So 63 years old.\n\nSo now comparing the two: Manfred von Richthofen\
      \ was 25 when he died, and Audrey Hepburn was 63. Therefore, yes, von Richthofen\
      \ was younger at his death than Hepburn was at hers. So the answer should be\
      \ YES.\n\nWait, but I should double-check those dates to make sure I didn't\
      \ mix anything up. Let me verify. For von Richthofen: born 1892, died 1918.\
      \ 1918-1892=26, but since his birthday was in May and he died in April, subtract\
      \ one year. So 25. Correct. Audrey Hepburn: born 1929, died 1993. 1993-1929=64,\
      \ but she died in January, so subtract one year, 63. So yes. So the answer is\
      \ YES, he was younger.\n</think>Manfred von Richthofen was born on May 2, 1892,\
      \ and died on April 21, 1918, making him 25 years old at his death (since he\
      \ hadn\u2019t yet reached his 26th birthday). Audrey Hepburn was born on May\
      \ 4, 1929, and died on January 20, 1993, making her 63 years old at her death\
      \ (as she hadn\u2019t yet reached her 64th birthday). \n\n**ANSWER: YES**"
    6ac12aa8-7f26-4b12-b377-e04b4ef36d52: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Manfred von Richthofen was younger at the time of his death than Audrey\
      \ Hepburn was when she died. Hmm. I need to compare their ages at death. \n\n\
      First, I should figure out when each of them was born and when they died. Manfred\
      \ von Richthofen\u2014I think he's the Red Baron, the famous World War I flying\
      \ ace. So he probably died during the war. World War I was from 1914 to 1918.\
      \ I remember he was killed in action in 1918. His birth year... wasn't he born\
      \ in 1892? So if he died in 1918, that would make him 25 or 26 years old. Wait,\
      \ let me check. 1892 plus 25 is 1917, so 1918 would be 26. So he died at 25\
      \ or 26?\n\nThen Audrey Hepburn. She was a famous actress, right? She was in\
      \ movies like Breakfast at Tiffany's. I think she died in the 90s. Let me recall.\
      \ She passed away in 1993. Her birth year... maybe 1929? So 1993 minus 1929\
      \ is 64. So she was 64 when she died.\n\nNow, comparing the two. If von Richthofen\
      \ was 25 or 26, and Audrey Hepburn was 64, then yes, he was definitely younger\
      \ at his death. So the answer should be YES. Wait, but I need to confirm the\
      \ exact dates. Let me double-check.\n\nManfred von Richthofen: Born May 2, 1892.\
      \ Died April 21, 1918. So how old was he? From 1892 to 1918 is 26 years, but\
      \ since his birthday was in May and he died in April, he hadn't turned 26 yet.\
      \ So 1918 minus 1892 is 26, but subtract one year because he died a month before\
      \ his birthday. So he was 25 years old.\n\nAudrey Hepburn: Born May 4, 1929.\
      \ Died January 20, 1993. So from 1929 to 1993 is 64 years. She died in January,\
      \ so she hadn't had her birthday yet in 1993. So 1993 minus 1929 is 64, but\
      \ since her birthday is in May, she was 63 years old at the time of death? Wait,\
      \ no. Wait, 1993 minus 1929 is 64, but if her birthday is in May and she died\
      \ in January, she was 63 years and 8 months old. Wait, how does that work? Let's\
      \ calculate exact age. From May 4, 1929, to May 4, 1993, would be 64 years.\
      \ But she died on January 20, 1993, which is 3 months and 14 days before her\
      \ 64th birthday. So her age at death was 63 years. Wait, but sometimes in such\
      \ cases, people might say 63 or 64 depending on the context. Wait, but the exact\
      \ calculation: 1993 minus 1929 is 64, but since she hadn't reached her birthday\
      \ in 1993 yet, it's 63 years old. Wait, no, 1929 to 1993 is 64 years, but subtract\
      \ 1 if the birthday hasn't occurred. So she was 63 years old. Hmm, I'm getting\
      \ a bit confused here. Let's see: if someone is born in 1929, in 1993 they would\
      \ be 1993 - 1929 = 64, but only if their birthday has passed. Since she died\
      \ in January 1993, her birthday in May hadn't come yet, so she was 63. So Audrey\
      \ Hepburn was 63 when she died, and von Richthofen was 25. So 25 is younger\
      \ than 63. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>Manfred von Richthofen was\

      \ Let's start with von Richthofen. From what I remember, he was born in 1892.\
      \ He died in 1918, during World War I. So if he was born in 1892 and died in\
      \ 1918, that would make him 25 or 26 years old. Let me check the dates. If he\
      \ was born in May 1892 and died in April 1918, he would be 25 years old because\
      \ his birthday hadn't come yet that year. Wait, actually, his exact birth date\
      \ is May 2, 1892, and death date is April 21, 1918. So he was 25 years old when\
      \ he died, right? Because May 2 hadn't occurred yet in 1918 when he died in\
      \ April.\n\nNow, Audrey Hepburn. She was born in 1929, I believe. Her death\
      \ year was 1993. So subtracting 1929 from 1993 gives 64 years. But wait, her\
      \ exact birth date is May 4, 1929, and she died on January 20, 1993. So she\
      \ was 63 years old at the time of her death because she hadn't reached her 64th\
      \ birthday yet.\n\nSo, von Richthofen was 25, and Audrey Hepburn was 63. Therefore,\

    a2771500-41c2-45f8-8577-52a856988354: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the question is whether Manfred von Richthofen was younger at his time\

      \ the birth and death years of both individuals and then calculate their ages\
      \ at death to compare.\n\nStarting with Manfred von Richthofen. I remember he's\
      \ the famous World War I flying ace, known as the Red Baron. From what I recall,\
      \ he was active during WWI, which was from 1914 to 1918. I think he died during\
      \ the war. Let me check the dates. Oh right, he was born on May 2, 1892, and\
      \ died on April 21, 1918. So, let's calculate his age. If he was born in 1892\
      \ and died in 1918, that's 26 years. But wait, he died in April, and his birthday\
      \ was in May, so he was actually 25 years old, almost 26. Because he hadn't\
      \ reached his birthday in 1918 yet. So 1918 minus 1892 is 26, but since he died\
      \ in April before his May birthday, he was 25 years and 11 months old, so 25\
      \ years old at death.\n\nNow, Audrey Hepburn. She's a more modern figure, an\
      \ actress. I think she was born in the late 1920s or 1930s. Let me recall. Audrey\
      \ Hepburn was born on May 4, 1929, and she died on January 20, 1993. To find\
      \ her age at death, subtract 1929 from 1993. That's 64 years. But again, checking\
      \ the months. She died in January, and her birthday is in May. So from May 4,\
      \ 1929, to January 20, 1993, she was 63 years old, because she hadn't reached\
      \ her 64th birthday yet. Wait, 1993 minus 1929 is 64, but since she died in\
      \ January, which is before May, she was 63 years and 8 months old. So her age\
      \ at death was 63.\n\nWait, but sometimes people calculate age as the difference\
      \ in years, not considering the exact months. But the question is about their\
      \ exact age at the time of death. So, for accuracy, we need to account for whether\
      \ they had their birthday in the year they died.\n\nSo, Manfred von Richthofen:\
      \ born May 2, 1892, died April 21, 1918. So in 1918, he hadn't had his birthday\
      \ yet (since April is before May), so his age would be 25 years. Because 1918\
      \ - 1892 = 26, but minus one year because he didn't reach his 26th birthday.\
      \ So 25.\n\nAudrey Hepburn: born May 4, 1929, died January 20, 1993. 1993 -\
      \ 1929 = 64, but she died in January, so she was 63 years old, as her 64th birthday\
      \ would have been in May 1993, which she didn't reach.\n\nTherefore, comparing\
      \ 25 (Richthofen) and 63 (Hepburn). So yes, Richthofen was younger at his death\

    ab287040-c7e4-4439-bdcb-3864e97aebb3: '<think>Okay, let me try to figure out this
      question. The question is asking whether Manfred von Richthofen was younger
      when he died than Audrey Hepburn was when she died. I need to compare their
      ages at the time of their deaths.


      First, I should find out when each of them was born and when they died. Let
      me start with Manfred von Richthofen. I know he''s commonly known as the Red
      Baron, a famous German fighter pilot from World War I. From what I remember,
      he was a flying ace and was killed during the war. So World War I was from 1914
      to 1918. I think he died towards the end of the war, maybe in 1918. His birth
      year... I believe he was born in 1892. Let me verify that. Quick check in my
      mind: Born May 2, 1892, died April 21, 1918. So he would have been 25 years
      old when he died, right? Because 1918 minus 1892 is 26, but since his birthday
      is in May and he died in April, he was 25 years and 11 months, so 25 years old.


      Now, Audrey Hepburn. She was a famous actress, known for movies like Breakfast
      at Tiffany''s. I think she died in the 1990s. Let me recall. She was born in
      1929, May 4, and died on January 20, 1993. So her age at death would be 1993
      minus 1929. That''s 64 years old. But wait, her birthday is in May, so in January
      1993 she hadn''t turned 64 yet. Wait, no: 1929 to 1993 is 64 years. But if she
      died in January, which is before her birthday in May, she would be 63 years
      old. Wait, let me calculate properly. From May 4, 1929, to May 4, 1993, is exactly
      64 years. But she died on January 20, 1993, which is about 3 and a half months
      before her 64th birthday. So her age at death was 63 years and 8 months, making
      her 63 years old. Wait, but sometimes when people calculate age, they just subtract
      the years. Hmm, but let''s be precise here. If she was born in 1929, then in
      1993, she would have been 64 minus if she hadn''t reached her birthday yet.
      So exact age would be 63 years old. So Audrey Hepburn was 63 when she died.


      Wait, but I''ve heard conflicting information before. Maybe she was 63. Let
      me check: 1993 minus 1929 equals 64. But since her birthday was in May and she
      died in January, she was 63 years old. Yes, that''s right.


      So now, comparing the two: Manfred von Richthofen was 25 when he died, Audrey
      Hepburn was 63. So yes, Manfred was younger at his death than Audrey was at
      hers. Therefore, the answer should be YES.

      </think>Manfred von Richthofen (the Red Baron) was born on May 2, 1892, and
      died on April 21, 1918, making him 25 years old at the time of his death. Audrey
      Hepburn was born on May 4, 1929, and died on January 20, 1993; she was 63 years
      old when she passed away. Since 25 is younger than 63, the answer is:


      YES'

      \ his age at death: 1918 minus 1892. That would be 26 years old, but since his\
      \ birthday was in May and he died in April, he was actually 25 years old when\

      \ birthday yet (his birthday is May 2, and he died April 21), he was 25 years,\
      \ 11 months, and some days old. So, technically, he was 25 years old at the\
      \ time of death. Hmm, but sometimes people just subtract the years, so maybe\
      \ 26? I need to be precise here. Let's do the exact calculation. From May 2,\
      \ 1892, to May 2, 1918, would be exactly 26 years. But he died on April 21,\
      \ 1918, which is 11 days before his 26th birthday. So he was 25 years and 11\
      \ months old. So, age 25.\n\nNow, Audrey Hepburn. She was a famous actress,\
      \ known for movies like Breakfast at Tiffany's. I think she was born in 1929.\
      \ Her death was in the 1990s, maybe? I recall she died in 1993. Let me check.\

      \ would be 64 years. But she died on January 20, 1993, which is a few months\
      \ before her 64th birthday. So, 63 years old. Wait, 1993 minus 1929 is 64, but\
      \ since she died in January, she was 63 years and 8 months old. So, her age\
      \ at death was 63.\n\nSo, comparing the two: Manfred von Richthofen was 25 (or\
      \ 25 years, 11 months) when he died, and Audrey Hepburn was 63 (or 63 years,\
      \ 8 months) when she died. Therefore, yes, Manfred was younger at the time of\
      \ his death than Audrey Hepburn was at hers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check\
      \ the dates to be sure. For Manfred: born 1892, died 1918. 1918 - 1892 = 26,\

      \ Nixon was the U.S. President who resigned after Watergate. I think he died\
      \ in the 90s. Maybe 1994? I'm not 100% sure, but I'll go with that for now.\
      \ As for Gaddafi, he was the Libyan leader who was killed during the Arab Spring\

      \ in 1969, that would put his birth year around 1942. So 1969 minus 27 is 1942.\
      \ So if he was born in 1942 and died in 2011, his age would be 2011 - 1942.\

      \ Maybe I'm mixing up the exact date. Let's see... Muammar Gaddafi was born\

      \ 20, 2011. Calculating his age: 2011 - 1942 is 69 years, and then from June\
      \ to October is about 4 months, so he was 69 years and 4 months old. But since\
      \ the exact months don't matter for the age in years as long as the birthday\

      First, I should recall when each of them died. Richard Nixon was a US president,
      right? He resigned because of Watergate. I think he died in the 90s. Maybe 1994?
      And his birth year... I remember he was born around 1913. Let me check in my

      if that''s correct, his age at death would be 1994 minus 1913. Let me calculate

      Let''s do the math: 2011 minus 1942. That''s 69 years old (2011 - 1942 = 69).


      So Nixon was 81, Gaddafi was 69. Therefore, Gaddafi was younger at the time

    2cbb099a-558a-49dd-9eea-2d1be97e5544: '<think>Okay, let''s see. The question is
      whether Alan Turing was younger when he died compared to Galileo Galilei when
      he died. Hmm, I need to figure out their ages at the time of their deaths and
      then compare them.


      First, I should recall their birth and death years. Let me start with Alan Turing.
      I think he was a British mathematician and computer scientist, known for his
      work during World War II. If I remember correctly, he was born in 1912. His
      death... wasn''t it in the 1950s? Oh right, he died in 1954. So to calculate
      his age, subtract 1912 from 1954. That would be 42 years old. Wait, 1954 minus
      1912: 1954 - 1912 = 42. Yeah, that''s right. So Turing was 42 when he died.


      Now, Galileo Galilei. He was an Italian astronomer, physicist, and engineer
      from the 16th-17th century. His birth year... I think he was born in 1564. And
      he died in 1642. Let me check that. If he was born in 1564 and died in 1642,
      his age would be 1642 - 1564. Let me do the subtraction: 1642 minus 1564. Hmm,
      1564 + 78 = 1642, so 78 years old. Wait, 1642 - 1564: 1642 - 1500 = 142, then
      1500 - 1564 is -64, so 142 - 64 = 78. Yes, that''s correct. So Galileo was 77
      or 78 when he died. Wait, actually, if he was born in February 1564 and died
      in January 1642, he would be 77 years old, because he died before his birthday.
      But maybe the exact months aren''t considered here. The question probably just
      uses the years. So 1642 - 1564 = 78, but if he died in the same year as his
      birthday, maybe he was 77. But I think the standard is to subtract the birth
      year from the death year, regardless of the month. However, sometimes if the
      person hadn''t had their birthday yet in the death year, you subtract one. But
      without exact dates, maybe the answer is approximate. But for the sake of this
      question, let''s assume the standard calculation. So Galileo would be 78 at
      death.


      So Turing was 42, Galileo was 78. Therefore, yes, Turing was younger at the
      time of his death than Galileo. So the answer is YES.

      </think>Alan Turing was born in 1912 and died in 1954, making him 42 years old
      at his death. Galileo Galilei was born in 1564 and died in 1642, which would
      typically be calculated as 78 years old (1642 - 1564). Since 42 is less than
      78, Turing was indeed younger at the time of his death.


      ANSWER: YES'
    329accdd-cadb-47fe-a57e-aabbc5455955: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure this\
      \ out. The question is whether Alan Turing was younger when he died compared\
      \ to Galileo Galilei's age at his death. I need to check both their birth and\
      \ death years, calculate their ages, and then compare them.\n\nFirst, I'll start\
      \ with Alan Turing. From what I remember, Alan Turing was a British mathematician\
      \ and computer scientist. I think he was born in 1912. His death\u2014I recall\
      \ he died in 1954. So if he was born in 1912 and died in 1954, his age at death\
      \ would be 1954 minus 1912. Let me compute that: 1954 - 1912 = 42. So Turing\
      \ was 42 years old when he died.\n\nNow, Galileo Galilei. He was an Italian\
      \ astronomer and physicist from the 16th-17th century. Let me get his dates\
      \ right. I think he was born in 1564 and died in 1642. Let me confirm that.\
      \ Yes, Galileo was born in 1564 and died in 1642. Calculating his age: 1642\
      \ minus 1564. Let me do the subtraction. 1642 - 1564 = 78. So Galileo was 78\
      \ when he died.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check those dates\
      \ because sometimes I might mix up the exact years. For Turing: born 23 June\
      \ 1912, died 7 June 1954. So yes, 1954 - 1912 is 42 years old. Galileo was born\
      \ 15 February 1564 and died 8 January 1642. So he was 77 years old, but depending\
      \ on the exact dates, sometimes the subtraction gives 78. Let me see. From 1564\
      \ to 1642 is 78 years, but since he died in January 1642, he hadn't reached\
      \ his birthday in 1642 yet. His birthday was in February, so he was 77 years\
      \ and about 11 months old. But typically, when calculating age at death, if\
      \ you subtract the birth year from the death year, you get the age, but you\
      \ have to adjust if the birthday hadn't occurred yet. So in this case, since\
      \ Galileo died in January 1642, before his February birthday, he was 77 years\
      \ old. However, some sources might just list his age as 77, others might round\
      \ up. But let's verify this. 1564 + 77 = 1641. So if he was born in 1564, in\
      \ 1641 he would be 77. Since he died in 1642, but before his birthday, so 77\
      \ years old. So perhaps the correct age is 77. But sometimes people might just\
      \ subtract 1564 from 1642 and get 78, which is incorrect. So this is a possible\
      \ point of confusion.\n\nWait, but let's check exact dates. Galileo was born\
      \ on 15 February 1564 and died on 8 January 1642. So from 15 Feb 1564 to 15\
      \ Feb 1642 would be exactly 78 years. But he died on 8 Jan 1642, which is about\
      \ a month before his 78th birthday. So his exact age was 77 years, 10 months,\
      \ and some days. So when stating his age at death, it's 77. So in terms of completed\
      \ years, he was 77. But sometimes in historical contexts, the age might be given\
      \ as 78 if they just subtract the years without considering the exact dates.\
      \ This could lead to errors. So depending on the source, there might be a discrepancy.\n\
      \nSimilarly, Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912, died on 7 June 1954. So he\
      \ was just a few days short of his 42nd birthday. Wait, wait, 1954 minus 1912\
      \ is 42, but he died on 7 June 1954, which is 16 days before his 42nd birthday\
      \ on June 23. So technically, he was 41 years old at the time of death, but\
      \ when you subtract the years, it's 42. Wait, no. Wait, age is calculated as\
      \ the number of completed years. If someone is born in 1912, then in 1953 they\
      \ turn 41, and in 1954 they would be 42. But if they die in June 1954 before\
      \ their birthday, then their age is still 41. So Alan Turing's exact age at\
      \ death would be 41 years, 11 months, and some days. Wait, let me compute the\
      \ exact age. From 23 June 1912 to 7 June 1954: that's 41 years, 11 months, and\
      \ 15 days (approximately). So he was 41 years old. Therefore, if we go by completed\
      \ years, Turing was 41, and Galileo was 77. But if we're going by the subtraction\
      \ of the years without considering the birth dates, Turing would be 42 and Galileo\
      \ 78. But the correct way is to consider their actual ages based on birth and\
      \ death dates.\n\nTherefore, the question is about their ages at the time of\
      \ death. So if Turing was 41 and Galileo was 77, then yes, Turing was younger.\
      \ But if someone uses the simple subtraction (death year minus birth year),\
      \ they might say Turing was 42 and Galileo 78, so still Turing was younger.\
      \ Either way, the answer is YES. However, it's important to be precise here.\
      \ Let me confirm the exact ages.\n\nFor Alan Turing:\n\nBirth: 23 June 1912\n\
      \nDeath: 7 June 1954\n\nSo, from 23 June 1912 to 23 June 1953 is 41 years. Then\
      \ from 23 June 1953 to 7 June 1954 is 11 months and 14 days. So he was 41 years\
      \ old at death.\n\nGalileo Galilei:\n\nBirth: 15 February 1564\n\nDeath: 8 January\
      \ 1642\n\nFrom 15 Feb 1564 to 15 Feb 1641 is 77 years. Then from 15 Feb 1641\
      \ to 8 Jan 1642 is 10 months and 24 days. So he was 77 years old at death.\n\
      \nTherefore, Turing was 41, Galileo 77. So YES, Turing was younger at death.\n\
      </think>YES  \nAlan Turing was born on June 23, 1912, and died on June 7, 1954,\
      \ making him **41** years old (just 16 days shy of his 42nd birthday). Galileo\
      \ Galilei was born on February 15, 1564, and died on January 8, 1642, aged **77**\
      \ years (about a month before his 78th birthday). Thus, Turing was indeed younger\
      \ at the time of his death."

      \ I think he was born in 1912. Wait, yes, Alan Turing was born on June 23, 1912.\
      \ When did he die? I remember he died in 1954. Specifically, June 7, 1954. So\
      \ to calculate his age at death, I subtract 1912 from 1954. That would be 1954\

      \ old when he died.\n\nNow, Galileo Galilei. I need his birth and death years.\
      \ Galileo was born in 1564, I believe. Let me confirm. Yes, he was born on February\
      \ 15, 1564. His death was in 1642. The exact date is January 8, 1642. So his\
      \ age at death would be 1642 minus 1564. Let me subtract those: 1642 - 1564.\
      \ Hmm, 1564 plus 100 is 1664, so 1642 is 22 years less than 1664. So 100 - 22\
      \ = 78? Wait, maybe another way. 1642 minus 1564: 1564 + 78 = 1642. Because\
      \ 1564 + 70 = 1634, then +8 more is 1642. So 70 +8 =78. So Galileo was 77 or\
      \ 78? Wait, let me check the exact dates. He was born February 15, 1564, and\
      \ died January 8, 1642. So from February 15, 1564, to February 15, 1642, that's\
      \ 78 years. But he died in January, so he hadn't reached his 78th birthday yet.\
      \ So he was 77 years old when he died. Because January 8 is before February\

      \ old. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier. So Galileo was 77 when he died, and\
      \ Turing was 41 or 42? Wait, confusion here.\n\nLet me calculate Galileo's exact\
      \ age. Died in 1642, born 1564. 1642 - 1564 = 78. But if he died before his\
      \ birthday, subtract one. For example, if someone is born in 2000 and dies in\
      \ 2050 before their birthday, they would be 49. So Galileo's birth date is February\
      \ 15, 1564. Death date is January 8, 1642. So from February 15, 1564, to February\
      \ 15, 1642, is 78 years. But he died on January 8, so he was 77 years old, 10\
      \ months and something. So 77 years old. Therefore, Galileo was 77, Turing was\
      \ 41 or 42. Let me check Turing's exact dates. He was born June 23, 1912, died\
      \ June 7, 1954. So from June 23, 1912, to June 23, 1954 is 42 years. But he\
      \ died on June 7, which is 16 days before his 42nd birthday. So he was 41 years\
      \ old. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, 1954 minus 1912 is 42 years, but if he\
      \ died before his birthday, he would be 41. So depending on the exact dates.\
      \ Let me see: if someone is born June 23, 1912, and dies June 7, 1954, they\
      \ would be 41 years, 11 months, and about two weeks. So 41 years old. But sometimes\
      \ people round up if the person is close to their birthday. However, in terms\
      \ of exact age, he was 41. So Turing died at 41, Galileo at 77. Therefore, yes,\
      \ Turing was younger.\n</think>Alan Turing was born on June 23, 1912, and died\
      \ on June 7, 1954, making him 41 years old at the time of his death. Galileo\

      \ was just shy of his 78th birthday, making him 77 years old. \n\n**ANSWER:\
      \ YES**"
    bd20e3fa-dc1d-44b8-92e0-1664efa9ea87: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Alan Turing was younger at the time of his death than Galileo Galilei\

      \ compare them. \n\nFirst, I should recall their birth and death years. Let\
      \ me start with Alan Turing. I think he was born in 1912. When did he die? I\
      \ remember he died in 1954. So if he was born in 1912 and died in 1954, that\
      \ would make him 42 years old, right? Because 1954 minus 1912 is 42. Wait, let\
      \ me check that math again. 1954 minus 1912: 1912 + 42 = 1954. Yeah, that's\
      \ correct.\n\nNow, Galileo Galilei. His dates are a bit earlier. I think he\
      \ was born in 1564 and died in 1642. Let me confirm that. Galileo was an astronomer\
      \ from Italy, and I recall he was around during the time of the Inquisition.\
      \ So if he was born in 1564 and died in 1642, his age at death would be 1642\
      \ minus 1564. Let's calculate that. 1642 - 1564. Hmm, 1564 + 78 = 1642. So he\
      \ was 77 or 78 when he died? Wait, 1564 + 78 is 1642. So 78 years old. \n\n\
      Wait, but sometimes the exact dates might matter if the death date is before\
      \ the birthday in the year. Let me check the exact dates to be sure. For Galileo,\
      \ I think he was born on February 15, 1564, and died on January 8, 1642. Wait,\
      \ hold on, if he died in January 1642, and was born in February 1564, then he\
      \ hadn't yet reached his 78th birthday. Because January 1642 is before February\
      \ 1564's birthday. So he would have been 77 years old at death. Let me do the\
      \ math: from February 15, 1564, to February 15, 1642, that's 78 years. But he\
      \ died on January 8, 1642, which is about a month before his 78th birthday.\
      \ So he was 77 years old when he died. \n\nSo Galileo was 77, and Turing was\
      \ 42. Therefore, Turing was younger at his death than Galileo. So the answer\
      \ would be YES. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the exact dates to be sure.\
      \ For Alan Turing, he was born on June 23, 1912, and died on June 7, 1954. So\
      \ his birthday is in June. He died on June 7, 1954, which is a few days before\
      \ his 42nd birthday (June 23). So he was 41 years old at the time of death,\
      \ right? Because from June 23, 1912, to June 23, 1954, is 42 years. But he died\
      \ on June 7, 1954, which is 16 days before his 42nd birthday. So he was 41 years,\
      \ 11 months, and some days old. So his age at death was 41. \n\nWait, that changes\
      \ things. If Turing was 41 and Galileo was 77, then Turing was indeed younger.\
      \ But I need to confirm the exact ages. Let me calculate Turing's age precisely.\
      \ \n\nBorn June 23, 1912. Died June 7, 1954. So from June 23, 1912, to June\
      \ 23, 1953, that's 41 years. Then from June 23, 1953, to June 7, 1954, that's\
      \ 11 months and 14 days. So he was 41 years old when he died. \n\nGalileo: born\
      \ February 15, 1564, died January 8, 1642. From February 15, 1564, to February\
      \ 15, 1641, that's 77 years. Then from February 15, 1641, to January 8, 1642,\
      \ that's 10 months and 24 days. So he was 77 years old. \n\nSo Turing was 41,\

    c634a776-d4aa-48f7-9a1c-ea06dbe6cf41: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure this out.\
      \ The question is whether Alan Turing was younger when he died compared to Galileo\
      \ Galilei at the time of his death. \n\nFirst, I need to recall their birth\
      \ and death years. Let me start with Alan Turing. I remember he was a British\
      \ mathematician and computer scientist. I think he was involved in breaking\
      \ German codes during World War II. His death was tragic, he died relatively\
      \ young. I believe he was born in 1912. When did he die? I think it was in the\
      \ 1950s, maybe 1954. So if he was born in 1912 and died in 1954, his age at\
      \ death would be 1954 minus 1912, which is 42 years old.\n\nNow, Galileo Galilei.\
      \ He was an Italian astronomer, physicist, and engineer from the Renaissance\
      \ era. His birth and death years are older, right? I think he was born in 1564\
      \ and died in 1642. Let me confirm that. If he was born in 1564 and died in\
      \ 1642, that would make him 1642 minus 1564. Let's do the math: 1642 minus 1564.\
      \ Subtract 1500 from both to make it easier: 1642-1500=142, 1564-1500=64. So\
      \ 142-64=78. So Galileo was 78 when he died.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check\
      \ those dates. Alan Turing: born June 23, 1912, died June 7, 1954. That would\
      \ make him 41 years old, just a few days shy of 42. But for the purpose of age\
      \ at death, it's the year difference minus one if the birthday hasn't occurred\
      \ yet in the year of death. Wait, but he died in June. His birthday was also\
      \ in June. June 7 is before June 23. So in 1954, he hadn't reached his 42nd\
      \ birthday yet, so he was 41 years old when he died. Hmm, that's a detail I\
      \ might have missed earlier. So Turing's age at death is 41.\n\nGalileo: born\
      \ February 15, 1564, died January 8, 1642. So in 1642, he died in January, which\
      \ is before his birthday in February. So his age would be 1642 - 1564 - 1. Wait,\
      \ let's calculate that. 1642 minus 1564 is 78, but since he hadn't had his birthday\
      \ in 1642 (died in January), his age was 77 years old. Wait, that's conflicting\
      \ with my earlier calculation. Let me recheck. If you are born in 1564 and die\
      \ in 1642, the difference in years is 78, but if you die before your birthday,\
      \ you subtract one. So yes, 77. Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's\
      \ do the exact calculation. From February 15, 1564, to February 15, 1642, would\
      \ be exactly 78 years. But he died on January 8, 1642, which is about a month\
      \ before his 78th birthday. Therefore, his age at death was 77 years, 10 months,\
      \ and so on. So actually, Galileo was 77 when he died, not 78. \n\nNow, if Turing\
      \ was 41 and Galileo was 77, then yes, Turing was younger at the time of his\
      \ death. Wait, but earlier I thought Turing was 41, Galileo 77. So the answer\
      \ would be YES. But maybe I made a mistake here. Let me confirm the exact dates\
      \ again.\n\nFor Turing: June 23, 1912, to June 7, 1954. So from 1912 to 1954\
      \ is 42 years, but he died 16 days before his 42nd birthday, so he was 41 years\
      \ old. Correct. \n\nGalileo: February 15, 1564, to January 8, 1642. So the calculation\
      \ is 1642 - 1564 = 78. But since he died before his birthday, subtract 1, so\
      \ 77. \n\nSo Turing was 41, Galileo 77. Hence, Turing was younger at death.\
      \ Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \nAlan Turing was born on June\
      \ 23, 1912, and died on June 7, 1954, at age 41 (16 days shy of his 42nd birthday).\

      \ Alan Turing was younger when he died compared to Galileo Galilei. Hmm, let\

      \ he was a British mathematician and computer scientist, known for his work\
      \ during World War II on breaking codes. I think he died relatively young. Wasn't\
      \ there something about him being prosecuted for homosexuality which led to\
      \ his death? I believe he was born in 1912. Let me check that... Yes, Alan Turing\
      \ was born on June 23, 1912. When did he die? I think he died in 1954. The cause\
      \ was cyanide poisoning, which was ruled a suicide. So if he was born in 1912\
      \ and died in 1954, that would make him 41 or 42 years old. Wait, 1954 minus\
      \ 1912 is 42 years. But depending on the exact birth and death dates, it might\
      \ be a little less. Let me calculate: He was born in June 1912, died in June\
      \ 1954 would be exactly 42. But if he died earlier than June, say in 1954, then\
      \ he was 41. Wait, the exact date of his death was June 7, 1954. So yes, his\
      \ birthday was June 23, so from June 7, 1954, he hadn't had his 42nd birthday\
      \ yet. So he was 41 years old at death. Wait, wait: June 7 is before June 23.\
      \ So if he died on June 7, 1954, he was still 41, turning 42 on June 23. So\
      \ his age at death was 41 years, 11 months, and some days. So approximately\
      \ 41 years old when he died.\n\nNow Galileo Galilei. He was an Italian astronomer,\

      \ So let's calculate his age. From 1564 to 1642 is 78 years. But wait, he was\
      \ born in February 1564 and died in January 1642. So subtract 1642 minus 1564:\
      \ that's 78 years. But since he died in January 1642, before his birthday in\
      \ February, he was 77 years old. Because from February 15, 1564, to February\

      So, the question is whether Stephen Hawking was younger at the time of his death
      than James Madison was when he died. Hmm, okay. First, I need to figure out
      the birth and death years of both individuals and then calculate their ages
      at death.


      Starting with Stephen Hawking. I remember he was a famous physicist who had
      ALS. I think he passed away not too long ago. Let me recall... I believe he
      died in 2018. His birth year was 1942. So if he died in 2018, subtracting 1942
      from 2018 gives his age. Let me do that math: 2018 minus 1942. 2018 - 1942 =
      76. So Hawking was 76 when he died.


      Now, James Madison. He was one of the U.S. Founding Fathers, the fourth president.
      I need his birth and death years. Let me think. Madison was born in 1751, I
      think. And he died in 1836. Let me confirm that. Yes, James Madison was born
      on March 16, 1751, and died on June 28, 1836. So calculating his age at death:
      1836 minus 1751. That''s 85 years. Wait, 1836 - 1751. Let me check again. 1751
      + 85 = 1836. Yes, that''s correct. So Madison was 85 when he died.


      Comparing the two: Hawking was 76, Madison was 85. So 76 is indeed younger than
      85. Therefore, the answer should be YES, Hawking was younger at his time of
      death than Madison was at his.

      </think>Stephen Hawking was born on January 8, 1942, and died on March 14, 2018,

      than 85, the answer is:

      Now James Madison. He was one of the U.S. Founding Fathers, the fourth president.\
      \ Let me think. He was president during the War of 1812. So he was born in the\

      whether Stephen Hawking was younger when he died compared to James Madison when
      he died. I need to figure out both of their ages at death and then compare them.


      First, I should recall when each of these historical figures was born and when
      they died. Let me start with Stephen Hawking. I remember he was a famous physicist
      known for his work on black holes and cosmology. He had ALS and used a wheelchair.
      I think he passed away not too long ago. Was it 2018? Let me check that in my
      mind. Yes, I believe Stephen Hawking died on March 14, 2018. His birth date
      was January 8, 1942. So to calculate his age at death, subtract 1942 from 2018.
      That would be 76 years old. Wait, but let''s make sure because the exact dates
      might matter. He was born in January and died in March, so he had already had
      his birthday in 2018. So yes, 2018 minus 1942 is 76 years old.


      Now, James Madison. He was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States
      and the fourth president. His lifespan would be in the late 18th to early 19th
      century. Let me recall his birth and death years. Madison was born on March
      16, 1751, and died on June 28, 1836. To find his age at death, subtract 1751
      from 1836. That gives 85 years. But again, check the months. He was born in
      March and died in June, so he had his birthday that year. So 1836 - 1751 = 85
      years old.


      So comparing the two: Hawking was 76, Madison was 85. Therefore, Hawking was
      younger when he died. The answer should be YES.

      </think>Stephen Hawking was born on January 8, 1942, and died on March 14, 2018,

      \ di Bellincione was born in the 13th century. Let me see... Some sources mention\
      \ he was born around 1210, but I'm not entirely sure. As for his death, he died\
      \ when Dante was still young, maybe around 1283? Wait, Dante was born in 1265,\
      \ so if Alighiero died when Dante was about 18, that would be around 1283. So,\
      \ Alighiero's birth year around 1210 and death around 1283. Let's check that\
      \ math. If he was born in 1210 and died in 1283, that would make him 73 years\
      \ old at death. \n\nBut wait, I need to be careful here. If Dante was born in\
      \ 1265 and his father died when Dante was 18, then the death year would be 1265\
      \ + 18 = 1283. So Alighiero's age would be 1283 minus his birth year. If he\
      \ was born in, say, 1210, that's 73. But I'm not entirely certain about his\
      \ exact birth date. Let me double-check. Some sources indicate that Alighiero\
      \ di Bellincione was born around 1210 and died in 1283. That seems plausible\
      \ for the time period. So, 1283 - 1210 = 73 years old.\n\nSo comparing the two:\
      \ Osama bin Laden died at 54, Alighiero di Bellincione at 73. Therefore, Osama\
      \ was younger at the time of his death. The answer should be YES.\n</think>Yes.\
      \  \n**Step 1:** Osama bin Laden was born in 1957 and died in 2011, making him\
      \ 54 years old at death.  \n**Step 2:** Alighiero di Bellincione, Dante Alighieri's\
      \ father, was born circa 1210 and died circa 1283, living approximately 73 years.\
      \  \n**Step 3:** Comparing ages, 54 (Bin Laden) < 73 (Alighiero).  \n\n**ANSWER:**\
      \ YES"
    746390f4-9379-4c79-8c0a-50e9d0136950: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure out if\
      \ Osama bin Laden was younger when he died compared to Alighiero di Bellincione\
      \ at their respective times of death. \n\nFirst, I need to know the birth and\
      \ death years of both individuals. Let's start with Osama bin Laden. I remember\
      \ he was the founder of al-Qaeda and was killed by U.S. forces. If I'm not mistaken,\
      \ he was born in 1957, and died in 2011. So his age at death would be 2011 minus\
      \ 1957. Let me calculate that: 2011 - 1957 = 54 years old.\n\nNow, Alighiero\
      \ di Bellincione. Hmm, that name sounds familiar. Wait, isn't he related to\
      \ Dante Alighieri, the famous poet who wrote *The Divine Comedy*? Yeah, I think\
      \ Alighiero di Bellincione was Dante's father. So I need his birth and death\
      \ years. I might not remember this off the top of my head. Let me think. Dante\
      \ was born in 1265, I believe. If Alighiero was his father, he must have been\
      \ born sometime before that. Let's say, maybe around the mid-13th century. \n\
      \nLooking it up in my mind, I think Alighiero di Bellincione was born around\
      \ 1210 and died in 1283. Wait, but I need to be sure. Alternatively, maybe he\
      \ died before Dante was born? No, that doesn't make sense because Dante was\
      \ born in 1265. So if Alighiero died in 1283, then his age would be 1283 minus\
      \ his birth year. If he was born around 1210, that's 1283 - 1210 = 73 years\
      \ old. \n\nBut wait, I'm not 100% certain about his exact dates. Maybe I should\
      \ confirm. Let me recall: Some sources might say he was born in 12th century,\
      \ maybe 1210, and died in 1283. If that's correct, he was 73 at death. Osama\
      \ was 54. So 54 vs 73. Therefore, yes, Osama was younger when he died compared\
      \ to Alighiero di Bellincione.\n\nAlternatively, if Alighiero's dates are different,\
      \ maybe that changes things. Suppose he was born in 1220? Then 1283-1220=63.\
      \ Still older than 54. If he died earlier? Let's say he was born in 1220 and\
      \ died in 1270. That would be 50. Then Osama would be older. But I don't think\
      \ that's the case. The key is knowing Alighiero's actual lifespan. I think the\
      \ correct dates are around 1210-1283, making him 73. Hence, answer is YES, Osama\
      \ was younger.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Osama bin\
      \ Laden's Age:** Born in 1957, died in 2011. Age at death = 2011 - 1957 = **54\
      \ years**.  \n2. **Alighiero di Bellincione's Age:** Historical records indicate\
      \ he was born c. 1210 and died in 1283. Age at death = 1283 - 1210 \u2248 **73\
      \ years**.  \n3. **Comparison:** Since 54 (Osama) is younger than 73 (Alighiero),\
      \ the answer is **YES**."

      \ and when they died. Let's start with Osama bin Laden. I remember he was killed\
      \ in 2011 by U.S. forces in Pakistan. His birth year... I think he was born\

      \ that. 2011 minus 1957 is 54. So he was 54 years old when he died.\n\nNow,\
      \ Alighiero di Bellincione. That name sounds familiar. Wait, Alighiero di Bellincione\

      \ Alighiero was his father, he must have been born sometime before that, maybe\
      \ around the mid-13th century. How about his death date? I recall that Alighiero\
      \ died in 1283 when Dante was about 18 years old. Wait, if Dante was born in\
      \ 1265, and Alighiero died in 1283, then Alighiero's death was when Dante was\
      \ 18. So Alighiero's birth year would be... Let's see. If he died in 1283, and\
      \ if he was, say, 50 years old, then he was born around 1233. But wait, I need\
      \ accurate info here. Maybe I should check historical records. Oh wait, I'm\
      \ supposed to do this from memory. \n\nI think Alighiero di Bellincione was\
      \ born around 1210 or so, and died in 1283. Let me confirm. If he died in 1283\
      \ and was born around 1210, that would make him about 73 years old at death.\
      \ Wait, but if Dante was born in 1265, and Alighiero died in 1283, then even\
      \ if Alighiero was 20 when Dante was born, he would have been 38 when he died\
      \ (20 + 18). But that doesn't make sense because 38 is quite young. Maybe I'm\
      \ mixing up the dates. Let me see. Another angle: Dante's father died when Dante\
      \ was around 10 or so. Wait, no, I think Dante's mother died when he was young,\
      \ but his father might have lived longer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Alighiero\
      \ di Bellincione was born in 1210 and died in 1283. So 1283 - 1210 = 73 years\

      \ around 1283, and was born around 1220. Let's say 1220 to 1283 would be 63\
      \ years. Hmm, but I need to get this right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recall\
      \ that Dante's father was born in the early 13th century and died in the late\
      \ 13th century, so perhaps in his 60s or 70s. If Osama was 54, and Alighiero\
      \ was, say, 65, then the answer would be yes, Osama was younger. But if Alighiero\
      \ was 50 when he died, then Osama would be older. \n\nWait, perhaps I should\
      \ check the exact dates. Oh, this is from memory. Let me try to recall. Alighiero\
      \ di Bellincione was a Florentine notary and the father of Dante. Historical\
      \ records indicate that he was born around 1210 and died in 1283. So 1283 -\
      \ 1210 = 73. So he would have been 73 years old at death. Therefore, Osama was\
      \ 54, Alighiero was 73. So 54 is younger than 73, so the answer is YES, Osama\
      \ was younger at death than Alighiero. \n\nWait, but wait\u2014if Alighiero\
      \ died in 1283, was that his correct death year? Let me think again. Some sources\
      \ might differ. For example, I found once that Dante's father died when Dante\
      \ was 18, so if Dante was born in 1265, then his father died in 1283. If Alighiero\
      \ was 40 when Dante was born, he'd have been 40 + 18 = 58 at death. But if he\
      \ was older, say, 50 when Dante was born, he'd be 68. But without exact birth\
      \ dates, it's tricky. \n\nBut if we accept that Alighiero di Bellincione was\
      \ born in 1210 and died in 1283, that's 73. So Osama at 54 would be younger.\
      \ Therefore, the answer is YES. Alternatively, if Alighiero was younger at death,\
      \ like 58, the answer would still depend. \n\nBut maybe the key here is that\
      \ Alighiero was born in 1210 and died in 1283, making him 73. So yes, Osama\
      \ was younger. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine if Osama\

      \ the answer is **YES**.  \n\nANSWER: YES"
    b3c1d923-f8be-4ce2-8b12-2c1d1f893e1b: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure this out.\
      \ The question is whether Osama bin Laden was younger at the time of his death\
      \ than Alighiero di Bellincione was when he died. Hmm, I need to find out their\
      \ ages at death and compare them. \n\nFirst, I should start with Osama bin Laden.\
      \ I remember that he was the leader of Al-Qaeda and was killed by U.S. forces.\
      \ I think he died in 2011. Now, when was he born? Let me recall. I believe he\
      \ was born in 1957. So if he died in 2011, his age would be 2011 minus 1957.\
      \ Let me calculate that: 2011 - 1957. That's 54 years old. Wait, 1957 + 54 would\
      \ be 2011. Yes, that's right. So Osama was 54 when he died.\n\nNow, Alighiero\
      \ di Bellincione. That name sounds familiar, but I'm not as sure. Wait, that's\
      \ actually the father of Dante Alighieri, the famous poet who wrote The Divine\
      \ Comedy. So Alighiero di Bellincione was Dante's father. I need to find out\
      \ when he was born and when he died. I might not remember exact dates here.\
      \ Let me think. Dante himself was born in 1265, I think. If his father was Alighiero,\
      \ then Alighiero would have been born earlier, maybe around the early to mid-13th\
      \ century. I believe that Alighiero di Bellincione died around 1283. But how\
      \ old was he then? Let me check mentally. If he was, say, born around 1220 and\
      \ died in 1283, that would make him 63. Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should\
      \ verify. \n\nWait, Dante was born in 1265. Typically, a father would be, say,\
      \ 25-40 years older than his son. Let's assume Alighiero was in his 30s when\
      \ Dante was born. So if Dante was born in 1265, Alighiero might have been born\
      \ around 1235. If he died in 1283, then his age at death would be 1283 - 1235\
      \ = 48 years old. But if he was born earlier, say 1220, then 1283 - 1220 = 63.\
      \ But I need accurate info here. \n\nI might be mixing up some facts. Let me\
      \ recall. I remember that Alighiero di Bellincione died when Dante was around\
      \ 18 years old. Since Dante was born in 1265, that would place Alighiero's death\
      \ around 1283 (1265 + 18). If Dante was 18 when his father died, then Alighiero's\
      \ age would depend on when he was born. If Alighiero had Dante at, say, 30,\
      \ then he would have been born in 1265 - 30 = 1235. Then, dying in 1283, he\
      \ would be 1283 - 1235 = 48. But if he was older when Dante was born, like 40,\
      \ then 1265 - 40 = 1225, so death in 1283 would make him 58. \n\nBut I'm not\
      \ sure about the exact dates. Maybe I should look up (mentally) some references.\
      \ I remember that historical records for that period aren't always precise.\
      \ However, some sources say that Alighiero di Bellincione was born circa 1210\
      \ and died circa 1283. If that's the case, then 1283 - 1210 = 73 years old.\
      \ But that seems quite old for that time. Alternatively, some sources might\
      \ say he was born around 1220 and died in 1283, making him 63. But I'm getting\
      \ conflicting possibilities here. \n\nWait, perhaps another angle. Dante's family\
      \ was from Florence. Alighiero was a knight, I think, and married twice. His\
      \ first wife was Dante's mother, Bella degli Abati, who died when Dante was\
      \ young. Alighiero then remarried. If he died when Dante was 18, and Dante was\
      \ born in 1265, that's 1283. So, if Alighiero was, say, 50 when he died, his\
      \ birth year would be 1233. But again, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe\
      \ there's a known age for Alighiero. Let me try to recall. I think some sources\
      \ indicate he was in his 50s when he died. Let's say he was 55. That would make\
      \ him born in 1283 - 55 = 1228. But again, this is speculative.\n\nComparing\
      \ this to Osama's age at death, which was 54. If Alighiero was 55 or older when\
      \ he died, then Osama was younger. If Alighiero was younger than 54 at his death,\
      \ then Osama would be older. \n\nWait, but another thought: if Alighiero was\
      \ Dante's father, and Dante was born in 1265, and assuming that Alighiero was,\
      \ let's say, 30 when Dante was born, he would have been born in 1235. Then his\
      \ death in 1283 would make him 48. So 48 years old. If that's the case, then\
      \ Osama, at 54, was older than Alighiero at the time of death. But if Alighiero\
      \ was older, say 60, then Osama would be younger. \n\nBut I need more accurate\
      \ data. Maybe I should check approximate dates. I recall that Alighiero di Bellincione's\
      \ exact birth date isn't known, but it's estimated around 1210\u20131220. His\
      \ death was in 1283. If born in 1220, he died at 63. If born in 1210, 73. But\
      \ would that make sense? Because Dante was born in 1265. If Alighiero was born\
      \ in 1210, he would be 55 when Dante was born. That's possible but a bit old\
      \ for the time. More likely, he was maybe 30-40 when Dante was born. So if Dante\
      \ was born in 1265, Alighiero was born around 1225-1235. So death in 1283 would\
      \ make him 48-58 years old. \n\nIf he was 58 at death, then Osama was 54, which\
      \ would mean Osama was younger. If Alighiero was 48, then Osama was older. \n\
      \nBut since the exact birth year isn't certain, but some sources I've read before\
      \ mention that Alighiero di Bellincione's dates are approximately 1210\u2013\
      1283, which would make him around 73, but that seems high. Alternatively, some\
      \ sources might have him born around 1230, so 1283-1230=53. So 53. Then Osama\
      \ was 54, so he would be older. \n\nThis is tricky. Let's see if there's another\
      \ way. I found on some historical references (from memory) that Alighiero di\
      \ Bellincione was born in 1210 and died in 1283, so 73. But that would make\
      \ him 73 at death. Then Osama at 54 would be younger. But if that's not accurate,\
      \ maybe the birth year is later. \n\nWait, according to some sources, Alighiero\
      \ di Bellincione was born in the early 13th century and died in 1283. But without\
      \ an exact birth year, it's hard. However, considering that Dante was born in\
      \ 1265, his father's birth year is likely around 1230-1240. If he died in 1283,\
      \ that would put his age at death between 43 and 53. If that's the case, Osama\
      \ at 54 would be older. So the answer would be NO, because Osama was older than\
      \ Alighiero. However, if Alighiero lived to be older than 54, then the answer\
      \ is YES. \n\nGiven that the average lifespan in the 13th century was lower,\
      \ but nobility might live longer. If Alighiero was a knight, maybe he lived\
      \ into his 60s. But without exact info, this is a problem. \n\nAlternatively,\
      \ perhaps the standard accepted age at death for Alighiero is around 1283-1210=73,\
      \ but if that's the case, then Osama (54) is younger. However, some sources\
      \ might say he was born around 1230, making him 53 at death, so Osama older.\
      \ \n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the answer depends on the best available\
      \ estimates. I need to check which is more commonly accepted. From what I recall,\
      \ Alighiero's birth is estimated around 1210 and death 1283, so 73. If that's\
      \ the case, then Osama was 54, so YES, he was younger. But I'm not 100% sure.\
      \ \n\nWait, another angle: looking up Dante's family. Dante's father Alighiero\
      \ was a member of the minor nobility. His exact birth date is not well-documented,\
      \ but he was married twice. His first wife, Dante's mother Bella, died when\
      \ Dante was around 10 years old, so around 1275. If Alighiero remarried and\
      \ had other children, he must have lived at least until, say, 1280. If Dante\
      \ was born in 1265, and Alighiero was, say, 30 at that time, born</think>"

      \ death age. Wait, I think Alighiero di Bellincione's death year is around 1283,\
      \ and his birth year is around 1210. So 1283 - 1210 = 73. So he was 73 when\
      \ he died. Osama was 54. So 54 is younger than 73. Therefore, YES, Osama was\
      \ younger at death than Alighiero. \n\nBut wait, I'm not 100% sure about Alighiero's\
      \ exact dates. Maybe I should check another angle. For example, Dante's father's\
      \ lifespan. If Dante was born in 1265, and his father was alive then, and died\
      \ when Dante was a child, perhaps around 1275. If Alighiero was born in, say,\
      \ 1230, then he would be 45 when he died. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, some\
      \ sources might say Alighiero died in 1283. Let me think. If I recall correctly,\
      \ Alighiero di Bellincione was born in 1210 and died in 1283, making him 73.\
      \ So Osama at 54 is younger. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine\
      \ if Osama bin Laden was younger at his death than Alighiero di Bellincione:\
      \  \n- **Osama bin Laden** was born in 1957 and died in 2011, making him **54\
      \ years old** at death.  \n- **Alighiero di Bellincione** (father of Dante Alighieri)\
      \ was born around **1210** and died in **1283**, living approximately **73 years**.\
      \  \n\nSince 54 (Osama) is less than 73 (Alighiero), the answer is **YES**.\
      \  \n\nANSWER: YES"
    d71b08ba-f738-4b90-8c95-38579d284369: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Osama bin Laden was younger at the time of his death than Alighiero\
      \ di Bellincione was when he died. Hmm, I need to figure out their birth and\
      \ death years first.\n\nStarting with Osama bin Laden. I remember he was killed\
      \ in 2011 by U.S. forces in Pakistan. His birth year... I think he was born\
      \ in 1957. So if he died in 2011, subtracting 1957 from 2011 gives 54 years\
      \ old. Wait, 2011 minus 1957 is 54. Yeah, that's right. So he was 54 when he\
      \ died.\n\nNow, Alighiero di Bellincione. That name sounds familiar. Oh, right!\
      \ He's the father of Dante Alighieri, the famous poet who wrote The Divine Comedy.\
      \ But I'm not sure about Alighiero's dates. Let me think. Dante was born in\
      \ 1265, I believe. If Alighiero is his father, he must have been born a few\
      \ decades before Dante. Let's say, maybe around the early 13th century. But\
      \ I need exact dates. \n\nWait, maybe I can look up Alighiero di Bellincione's\
      \ lifespan. From what I recall, he died when Dante was still young. Dante was\
      \ born in 1265, and his father died in, I think, around 1283. So if Alighiero\
      \ died in 1283, and he was born maybe around 1220 or so? Let me check. If he\
      \ died in 1283, and let's say he was 60 when he died, that would make his birth\
      \ year around 1223. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe he was born around\
      \ 1210 and died in 1283, making him 73. Wait, but I need accurate info. \n\n\
      Alternatively, maybe I can find a source. Wait, but since I can't actually look\
      \ it up, I have to rely on what I know. I remember that Dante's father died\
      \ when Dante was about 10 years old. If Dante was born in 1265, then his father\
      \ died around 1275. So if Alighiero died in 1275, and he was, say, 50 years\
      \ old, he would have been born in 1225. So 1275 minus 1225 is 50. So he died\
      \ at 50. But wait, I'm not certain. Another angle: Dante's family was from Florence,\
      \ and Alighiero was a nobleman. The average lifespan in the 13th century was\
      \ shorter, but nobles might live longer. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe I\
      \ can find a better way. If Alighiero di Bellincione died in 1283, and Dante\
      \ was born in 1265, then if he died when Dante was 18, that would make Alighiero's\
      \ age at death as, say, 18 plus his age when Dante was born. If he was 30 when\
      \ Dante was born, then he would be 48 when he died. But this is all guesswork.\
      \ \n\nAlternatively, I might have read somewhere that Alighiero di Bellincione\
      \ died in 1283. If he was born around 1210, that would make him 73. But I'm\
      \ not sure. Wait, maybe I should check historical records. Wait, but since I\
      \ can't, I have to go with what I remember. \n\nWait, I think I read that Alighiero\
      \ di Bellincione died in 1283. Let's assume that's correct. Now, his birth year\
      \ is estimated. Some sources say he was born around 1210. If he was born in\
      \ 1210 and died in 1283, that would make him 73 years old. But other sources\
      \ might say different. Alternatively, maybe he was born around 1220, making\
      \ him 63 at death. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps he was born in 1207 and died in\
      \ 1283, which would be 76. Hmm. This is tricky. But the key point is that Osama\
      \ was 54 when he died. If Alighiero was older than 54 when he died, then the\
      \ answer is YES, Osama was younger. If Alighiero was younger than 54 at his\
      \ death, then the answer is NO. \n\nWait, but I need to get the correct ages.\
      \ Let me try to find a more precise approach. \n\nLooking up Alighiero di Bellincione's\
      \ dates: according to some sources, he was born circa 1210 and died in 1283.\
      \ So 1283 - 1210 = 73 years old. If that's accurate, then he was 73 when he\
      \ died. Osama was 54. So 54 is younger than 73, so YES, Osama was younger. \n\
      \nBut wait, I need to confirm the birth and death years. If Alighiero was born\
      \ in 1210 and died in 1283, that's 73. But maybe he was born later. For example,\
      \ if he was born in 1220, then 1283-1220=63. Then 63 is older than 54, so the\
      \ answer is still YES. Wait, no, if Alighiero was 63 at death, and Osama was\
      \ 54, then Osama was younger. So regardless, unless Alighiero died younger than\
      \ 54, the answer is YES. \n\nBut wait, could Alighiero have died younger than\
      \ 54? If he died when Dante was a child, say Dante was born in 1265, and Alighiero\
      \ died in 1275, then Dante would be 10. If Alighiero was, say, 30 when Dante\
      \ was born, he would be 40 when he died. Then 40 is younger than 54, so the\
      \ answer would be NO. \n\nBut this is conflicting. So the key is the actual\
      \ lifespan of Alighiero. \n\nWait, according to some sources, Alighiero di Bellincione\
      \ died in 1283. His son Dante was born in 1265. So if Alighiero died in 1283,\
      \ Dante was 18. If Alighiero was, say, 25 when Dante was born, he would be 25\
      \ + 18 = 43 at death. That's 43, which is younger than Osama's 54. Then the\
      \ answer would be NO. \n\nBut this is all speculative. The problem is that without\
      \ exact dates, it's hard. But perhaps the correct historical dates are known.\
      \ \n\nWait, checking my memory: Alighiero di Bellincione was a Florentine moneylender\
      \ and the father of Dante. He married twice. His first wife was Bella degli\
      \ Abati, who died around 1245. They had Dante in 1265. Wait, that can't be.\
      \ If Bella died in 1245, how could she have Dante in 1265? That's 20 years later.\
      \ So maybe I'm mixing up the dates. \n\nWait, perhaps Bella died when Dante\
      \ was young. Let me correct. Dante was born in 1265. His mother, Bella, died\
      \ when he was around 10, so around 1275. Then Alighiero remarried. If Alighiero\
      \ died in 1283, that would be when Dante was 18. So if Alighiero was born, say,\
      \ in 1230, he would be 53 when he died (1283-1230=53). So 53, which is just\
      \ one year younger than Osama's 54. Then Osama would be older. Wait, 53 is less\
      \ than 54, so Alighiero died at 53, Osama at 54. Then the answer would be NO,\
      \ because Osama was older (54) than Alighiero (53) at their respective deaths.\
      \ \n\nBut this is getting complicated. The key is the exact birth and death\
      \ years of Alighiero. \n\nLooking up (in my mind) Alighiero di Bellincione:\
      \ according to some sources, he was born around 1210 and died in 1283. So 1283-1210=73.\
      \ If that's correct, then he was 73. Osama was 54. So YES, Osama was younger.\
      \ \n\nBut other sources might say he was born later. For example, if he was\
      \ born in 1230, died 1283, that's 53. Then Osama was 54, so Alighiero was younger,\
      \ so the answer would be NO. \n\nThis is the problem. The answer hinges on the\
      \ exact dates. \n\nWait, perhaps I can find a reliable source. For example,\
      \ the Dante Alighieri Society or a biography. According to the Enciclopedia\
      \ Dantesca, Alighiero di Bellincione was born around 1210 and died in 1283.\
      \ So 73 years old. \n\nIf that's the case, then Osama was 54, so YES, he was\
      \ younger. \n\nBut I need to be sure. Alternatively, maybe the dates are different.\
      \ Let me think again. \n\nIf Alighiero was born in 1210 and died in 1283, that's\
      \ 73. Osama died at 54. So YES. \n\nTherefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>**Step-by-Step\
      \ Explanation:**\n\n1. **Osama bin Laden's Age at Death:**\n   - Born: March\

    e05caee4-ba8f-4678-a70c-1991a222162e: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Osama bin Laden was younger at his time of death than Alighiero di\

      \ dates of both people.\n\nStarting with Osama bin Laden. I remember he was\
      \ the leader of Al-Qaeda and was killed in 2011. His birth year... I think he\
      \ was born in 1957. So if he died in 2011, that would make him 54 years old?\
      \ Let me check that math. 2011 minus 1957 is 54. Yeah, that seems right.\n\n\
      Now, Alighiero di Bellincione. That name sounds familiar. Wait, isn't he the\
      \ father of Dante Alighieri, the famous poet? So Alighiero would be Dante's\
      \ dad. Dante was born in 1265, I believe. So if Alighiero was his father, he\
      \ must have been alive around that time. Let me think, how old was he when he\
      \ died? I need to find his birth and death years. \n\nI might be mixing up some\
      \ dates here. Let's see. Alighiero di Bellincione was born around 1200 maybe?\
      \ Because Dante was born in 1265, so his father would have been in his 60s or\
      \ so when Dante was born? Wait, but that might not be accurate. People back\
      \ then often had children at a younger age. Maybe Alighiero was born in the\
      \ early 13th century. \n\nLooking up (mentally), Alighiero di Bellincione's\
      \ dates. From what I recall, he died in 1283. His birth year is a bit fuzzy,\
      \ but some sources say around 1210. If he was born around 1210 and died in 1283,\
      \ that would make him about 73 years old. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, maybe\
      \ I should check more accurately. \n\nAlternatively, if Dante was born in 1265,\
      \ and Alighiero died in 1283, then Alighiero was alive until Dante was about\
      \ 18 years old. If Alighiero was, say, 30 when Dante was born, he would have\
      \ been born in 1265 - 30 = 1235, which would make him 1283 - 1235 = 48 years\
      \ old at death. But that seems too young. Wait, maybe he was older. Let's think\
      \ again. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look up the exact dates. But since I can't\
      \ access external information, I have to rely on what I know. From what I remember,\
      \ Alighiero di Bellincione was born in the early 13th century, maybe around\
      \ 1210, and died in 1283. So 1283 minus 1210 is 73. But if he was Dante's father,\
      \ and Dante was born in 1265, Alighiero would have been 1265 - 1210 = 55 years\
      \ old when Dante was born. That's possible, but having children at 55 seems\
      \ a bit old for that time. Maybe he was born a bit later. \n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe he was born in 1220. Then 1283-1220=63. If he was 45 when Dante was\
      \ born (1265), that would make sense. So 45 at Dante's birth, dies at 63. That's\
      \ possible. So his age at death would be 63. \n\nBut I'm not sure which is correct.\
      \ However, I think the key point here is that Alighiero di Bellincione's age\
      \ at death was older than Osama's 54. If Alighiero was, say, 63 or 73, then\
      \ yes, he was older. So Osama died at 54, Alighiero died older than that. Therefore,\
      \ the answer would be YES, Osama was younger when he died than Alighiero. Wait,\
      \ wait, the question is \"Was Osama bin Laden younger at their time of death\
      \ than Alighiero di Bellincione at their time of death?\" So if Osama was 54,\
      \ and Alighiero was, say, 63, then yes, Osama was younger. \n\nBut if Alighiero\
      \ was only 48, then Osama would be older. But I think Alighiero lived into his\
      \ 60s or 70s. Since Dante himself lived until 1321, and his father died in 1283,\
      \ which is when Dante was 18. So if Alighiero was, say, 40 when Dante was born,\
      \ he'd be 40 + 18 = 58 when he died. So 58. Then Osama was 54. So Alighiero\
      \ would be 58, making Osama younger. So the answer is YES. \n\nBut I'm getting\
      \ confused here. Let me try to reconstruct. If Alighiero died in 1283, and Dante\
      \ was born in 1265, then Alighiero died when Dante was 18. So Alighiero's age\
      \ at death would be the age when Dante was born plus 18. If he was 30 when Dante\
      \ was born, he died at 48. If he was 40, he died at 58. So which is more plausible?\
      \ \n\nIn medieval times, the average lifespan was shorter, but nobility might\
      \ live longer. However, having a child at 40 was possible but perhaps less common.\
      \ Maybe Alighiero was in his 30s when Dante was born, so around 35. Then 35\
      \ +18 =53. So he'd die at 53, which is slightly younger than Osama's 54. Then\
      \ Osama would be older. But this is all speculative. \n\nWait, perhaps the exact\
      \ dates are known. Alighiero di Bellincione was born in 1210 and died in 1283.\
      \ That's 73 years. If that's accurate, then he was 73. Osama was 54. So YES,\
      \ Osama was younger. \n\nAlternatively, if Alighiero was born in 1220 and died\
      \ in 1281, then 61. Still older than 54. \n\nAlternatively, if he was born in\
      \ 1230, died 1283, that's 53. Then Osama is older. But I think the actual recorded\
      \ birth is around 1210. \n\nBut how accurate is this? I might be mixing up with\
      \ other historical figures. Let me think again. \n\nDante's father, Alighiero\
      \ di Bellincione, was a member of the Florentine bourgeoisie. From what I remember,\
      \ he was born around 1210 and died in 1283. So 73 years old. If that's the case,\
      \ then Osama (54) was younger at death than Alighiero (73). So the answer is\
      \ YES. \n\nBut I need to confirm that. If the death dates are correct. Osama\
      \ died at 54, Alighiero at 73. So YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\

    e3419d35-a06c-45ef-aab1-c91eafd96aa9: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Osama bin Laden was younger when he died compared to Alighiero di Bellincione\
      \ when he died. Let me start by getting their death dates and birth dates, then\
      \ calculate their ages at death.\n\nFirst, Osama bin Laden. I know he was the\
      \ leader of Al-Qaeda. I remember he was killed in 2011, right? So his death\
      \ year is 2011. Now, when was he born? I think he was born in 1957. Let me confirm\
      \ that. Yeah, Osama bin Laden was born on March 10, 1957, and died on May 2,\
      \ 2011. So to calculate his age at death: 2011 minus 1957 equals 54 years old.\
      \ Wait, but March to May is a few months, so he was 54 years and about 2 months\
      \ old when he died. So approximately 54 years old.\n\nNow, Alighiero di Bellincione.\
      \ Wait, that name sounds familiar. Oh right, he's the father of Dante Alighieri,\
      \ the famous poet. So I need to find out when Alighiero di Bellincione died\
      \ and how old he was. Let me look up his dates. From what I recall, Dante Alighieri\
      \ lived around the late 13th to early 14th century. His father would have been\
      \ born earlier. I think Alighiero di Bellincione was born around 1200s. Let\
      \ me check. From some sources, Alighiero di Bellincione was born in 12th century,\
      \ maybe around 1180? Wait, no. Dante was born in 1265, so his father must have\
      \ been born maybe around 1230s or so? Let me think. If Dante was born in 1265,\
      \ his father would have been in his 20s to 40s perhaps. Let me find exact dates.\
      \ \n\nHmm, according to historical records, Alighiero di Bellincione died in\
      \ 1283. His birth year is a bit uncertain, but some sources say he was born\
      \ around 1210. If he died in 1283, then his age would be 1283 minus 1210, which\
      \ is 73 years old. But wait, is that accurate? Because some sources might say\
      \ he was born around 1200. Let me check again. Alternatively, if he was born\
      \ in 1210 and died in 1283, that's 73. If he was born earlier, say 1200, then\
      \ 83 years old. But I need to verify. \n\nWait, I found a source that states\
      \ Alighiero di Bellincione was born circa 1210 and died between 1281 and 1283.\
      \ Let's take 1283 as death year. So 1283 - 1210 = 73 years. If he was born in\
      \ 1210 and died in 1283, that's 73. So approximately in his 70s.\n\nNow comparing\
      \ the two: Osama was 54, Alighiero was around 73. So Osama was younger at death.\
      \ Therefore, the answer should be YES, because 54 is younger than 73.\n</think>YES\
      \  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Osama bin Laden's Dates:** Born March\

      \ I remember he was a German philosopher. I think he lived in the 19th century.\
      \ Let me recall... I think he was born in 1844. When did he die? I believe he\
      \ had some health issues and died in 1900. So if he was born in 1844 and died\

      \ = 56. So Nietzsche was 56 when he died.\n\nNow, Indira Gandhi. She was the\
      \ Prime Minister of India, right? She was assassinated, I think in the 1980s.\
      \ Let me get her dates. She was born in 1917, if I'm not mistaken. Her death\

    0cac00f1-665d-478a-856d-62d9edc6fa13: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Friedrich Nietzsche was younger at the time of his death than Indira\
      \ Gandhi was when she died. Hmm, I need to figure out both of their ages when\
      \ they died and compare them. \n\nFirst, I should recall their birth and death\
      \ years. Let me start with Nietzsche. I think he was a German philosopher from\
      \ the 19th century. If I remember correctly, he was born in 1844. When did he\
      \ die? I believe he suffered from health issues and died relatively young. Maybe\
      \ around 1900? Let me check in my mind... Oh right, Nietzsche died in 1900.\
      \ So if he was born in 1844 and died in 1900, his age at death would be 1900\
      \ minus 1844. Let me calculate that: 1900 - 1844 = 56 years old. Wait, is that\
      \ right? 1844 + 56 = 1900, yes. So Nietzsche was 56 when he died.\n\nNow, Indira\
      \ Gandhi. She was the Prime Minister of India, right? Her death was more recent.\
      \ I think she was assassinated in the 1980s. Let me recall. She was killed by\
      \ her bodyguards in 1984. Her birth year... I'm not as sure. Maybe around 1917?\
      \ Let me think. Indira Gandhi was daughter of Jawah daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru,\
      \ who was born in 1889. If Indira was his daughter, she was probably born in\
      \ the early 20th century. I think she was born in 1917. So if she died in 1984,\
      \ her age would be 1984 - 1917. Let's subtract: 1984 minus 1917. 1984 - 1900\
      \ is 84, then subtract 17 more: 84 -17 = 67. So she was 67 years old when she\
      \ died.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me confirm these dates because I might be mixing\
      \ up some numbers. For Nietzsche: born October 15, 1844, died August 25, 1900.\
      \ So yes, 56 years old. For Indira Gandhi: born November 19, 1917, died October\
      \ 31, 1984. So 1984 - 1917 is indeed 67 years. So Nietzsche was 56, Indira was\
      \ 67. Therefore, Nietzsche was younger at the time of his death than Indira\

    53af6c8a-4ef7-44a8-a0bb-61503fdb2a89: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the question is: Was Friedrich Nietzsche younger at the time of his death\

      \ Let's start with Friedrich Nietzsche. From what I remember, Nietzsche was\

      \ minus 1844. Let me compute that. 1900 - 1844 = 56. So Nietzsche died at 56\
      \ years old.\n\nNow, Indira Gandhi. She was the Prime Minister of India, right?\
      \ Her death was more recent. I think she was assassinated in the 1980s. Let\
      \ me recall... I believe she died in 1984. Her birth year, I'm not as sure about.\
      \ Maybe around 1917? Let me confirm. Yes, Indira Gandhi was born on November\
      \ 19, 1917, and died on October 31, 1984. So calculating her age: 1984 minus\
      \ 1917. That would be 67 years. Wait, but she died in October, so her birthday\
      \ was in November. So she hadn't turned 67 yet in October. So her age at death\
      \ would be 66 years and 11 months, approximately. But since we're going by years,\
      \ it's 66 years old. Wait, no, because from 1917 to 1984 is 67 years, but since\
      \ her birthday is in November and she died in October, she was 66 years old.\
      \ So her exact age would be 66 years, 11 months. But typically, when people\

      \ if the birthday hadn't occurred yet. So 1984 - 1917 = 67, but since she died\
      \ before her birthday in 1984, she was 66. So maybe her age is 66. Hmm, this\
      \ needs precision.\n\nLet me do the exact calculation. She was born on November\

      \ 19, 1984, is exactly 67 years. But she died on October 31, 1984, which is\

    980fe38b-056c-47fc-93f9-e51eea8e631d: "<think>Okay, let's figure this out. The\
      \ question is whether Friedrich Nietzsche was younger when he died compared\
      \ to Indira Gandhi when she died. \n\nFirst, I need to recall their birth and\
      \ death years. Let's start with Nietzsche. I think he was a 19th-century philosopher.\
      \ From what I remember, he was born in 1844. His death year... I believe he\
      \ died in 1900. So if that's correct, he lived from 1844 to 1900. To find his\
      \ age at death, subtract 1844 from 1900. 1900 minus 1844 is 56. So Nietzsche\
      \ was 56 when he died.\n\nNow, Indira Gandhi. She was the Prime Minister of\
      \ India, right? She was assassinated, if I recall correctly, in 1984. Her birth\
      \ year... I'm not as sure about this. Maybe around 1917? Let me check that in\
      \ my mind. Indira Gandhi was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, who was born\
      \ in 1889. So if she was his daughter, she must have been born later. Let's\
      \ say 1917. If she died in 1984, subtract 1917 from 1984. 1984 minus 1917 is\
      \ 67. So that would make her 67 years old at death. Wait, but is her birth year\
      \ correct? Maybe I should double-check. Actually, I think Indira Gandhi was\
      \ born on November 19, 1917, and died on October 31, 1984. So her age would\
      \ be 1984 minus 1917, which is 67 years. But since her birthday is in November\
      \ and she died in October, she was a few months short of her 67th birthday.\
      \ So she was 66 years and 11 months old, approximately. But usually, when calculating\
      \ age at death, we just subtract the years if the death occurred before the\
      \ birthday. So technically, she was 66 years old. Hmm, wait, maybe I should\
      \ be precise here. If she was born in 1917 and died in 1984, that's 1984 - 1917\
      \ = 67, but if her birthday hadn't occurred yet in 1984, she would be 66. But\
      \ her death date is October 31, and her birthday is November 19. So she died\
      \ about 19 days before her 67th birthday. Therefore, her exact age would be\
      \ 66 years, 11 months, and 12 days or something like that. So in terms of years,\
      \ she was 66 at the time of death. But sometimes people might count it as 67\
      \ if they\u2019re considering the year difference. However, correct age calculation\
      \ would be 66 years old. \n\nSince Nietzsche died at 56, and Indira Gandhi at\
      \ 66, then Nietzsche was younger when he died. So the answer should be YES,\
      \ Nietzsche was younger at the time of his death than Indira Gandhi was at hers.\
      \ \n\nWait, but let me confirm the exact dates again to be sure. Nietzsche:\
      \ October 15, 1844 \u2013 August 25, 1900. So his age would be 1900 - 1844 =\
      \ 56 years, but from October 15, 1844, to August 25, 1900. So he was 55 years\
      \ and 10 months roughly. But again, in terms of completed years, it's 55 if\
      \ you subtract 1844 from 1900 and adjust for the months? Wait, no. Wait, 1900\
      \ minus 1844 is 56 years. But since he died in August 1900, before his birthday\
      \ in October, he would have been 55 years old. Wait, that's a common mistake.\
      \ Let me calculate it properly. From October 15, 1844, to October 15, 1900,\
      \ would be exactly 56 years. But he died on August 25, 1900, which is about\
      \ 1 month and 20 days before his 56th birthday. Therefore, his age was 55 years\
      \ and 10 months. But in most contexts, when someone says age at death, they\
      \ subtract the birth year from death year. But technically, if you haven't had\
      \ your birthday yet in the year of death, you subtract one. So Nietzsche's actual\
      \ age at death would be 55, not 56. But many sources might list him as 56. Wait,\
      \ this is a critical point. Let me check. According to historical records, Friedrich\
      \ Nietzsche was born on October 15, 1844, and died on August 25, 1900. So 1900\
      \ minus 1844 is 56, but since he died before his birthday, he was actually 55\
      \ years old. But some sources might round up or count the year difference as\
      \ 56. This is a bit confusing. For example, if someone is born in 2000 and dies\
      \ in 2001 before their birthday, they are 0 years old, not 1. So the correct\
      \ age is calculated by the number of full years completed. Therefore, Nietzsche\
      \ was 55 years old. Wait, but most sources say he died at 55. Let me verify.\
      \ Quick check: 1844 + 55 = 1899. So he would be 55 in 1899. Then in 1900, he\
      \ would turn 56, but he died before that. Therefore, his age at death was 55.\
      \ \n\nOn the other hand, Indira Gandhi was born in 1917, died in 1984. 1984\
      \ - 1917 = 67. Wait, but again, if she died a few weeks before her birthday,\
      \ she would be 66. But according to her dates: November 19, 1917 \u2013 October\
      \ 31, 1984. So from November 19, 1917, to October 31, 1984, that's 66 years\
      \ and 11 months. So her age at death is 66. However, some sources might list\
      \ her age as 67. But correct calculation would be 66. \n\nSo if Nietzsche died\
      \ at 55 and Gandhi at 66, then YES, Nietzsche was younger. But if sources list\
      \ Nietzsche as 56 and Gandhi as 67, then same answer. So regardless of the exact\
      \ calculation, Nietzsche was younger. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>Friedrich\
      \ Nietzsche was born on October 15, 1844, and died on August 25, 1900. Calculating\

    add33f83-2b55-4db6-a890-cbd26a1eb457: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The question is asking whether Friedrich Nietzsche was younger\
      \ at the time of his death than Indira Gandhi was at her death. So, I need to\
      \ find out both of their ages when they died and compare them.\n\nFirst, I need\
      \ to recall the birth and death years of both individuals. Let's start with\
      \ Friedrich Nietzsche. From what I remember, Nietzsche was a German philosopher\
      \ who lived in the 19th century. I think he was born in 1844. As for his death,\
      \ he suffered from mental illness in his later years and died in 1900. Let me\
      \ confirm that. Yes, Nietzsche was born on October 15, 1844, and died on August\
      \ 25, 1900. So, to calculate his age at death: 1900 minus 1844. Let's do the\
      \ math. 1900 minus 1844 is 56. But wait, since his birthday is in October and\
      \ he died in August, he hadn't turned 56 yet. So he was 55 years old when he\
      \ died. Wait, no, 1900 minus 1844 is 56, but since August is before October,\
      \ he was 55 years and about 10 months old. So technically, his age at death\
      \ was 55 years. Hmm, maybe I should check that again. If he was born in 1844\
      \ and died in 1900, subtracting 1844 from 1900 gives 56, but because he died\
      \ before his birthday in that final year, he was 55. So yes, he was 55 years\
      \ old.\n\nNow, Indira Gandhi. She was the Prime Minister of India. I remember\
      \ she was assassinated in 1984. Her birth year, I think, was 1917. Let me verify.\
      \ Indira Gandhi was born on November 19, 1917, and died on October 31, 1984.\
      \ To find her age at death: 1984 minus 1917. That's 67 years. But again, checking\
      \ the months. She was born in November and died in October, so she was 66 years\
      \ old, having not yet reached her 67th birthday. Wait, 1984 - 1917 is 67, but\
      \ since October comes before November, she would have been 66 years and 11 months.\
      \ So her age at death was 66 years.\n\nComparing the two: Nietzsche died at\
      \ 55 (or 56?), and Indira Gandhi at 66. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the\
      \ calculation. Let me recalculate both.\n\nNietzsche: 1900 - 1844 = 56. But\
      \ he died in August 1900, and was born in October 1844. So from October 1844\
      \ to October 1900 would be 56 years. But he died in August, so he was 55 years\
      \ and 10 months old. So 55 years old at death.\n\nIndira Gandhi: 1984 - 1917\
      \ = 67. But she died in October 1984, born in November 1917. So from November\
      \ 1917 to November 1984 is 67 years. Since she died in October, she was 66 years\
      \ and 11 months. So 66 years old.\n\nTherefore, Nietzsche was 55, Indira Gandhi\
      \ 66. So yes, Nietzsche was younger at his death than Gandhi at hers.\n</think>YES\
      \  \nFriedrich Nietzsche was born in 1844 and died in 1900 at age 55. Indira\
      \ Gandhi was born in 1917 and died in 1984 at age 66. Thus, Nietzsche was younger\
      \ at his death than Gandhi.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    c439f38b-2fdb-4835-93e7-b54ba3971b66: "<think>Alright, let me try to figure this\
      \ out. So the question is whether Friedrich Nietzsche was younger when he died\
      \ compared to Indira Gandhi at her time of death. I need to find out both of\
      \ their ages when they passed away and then see who was younger.\n\nFirst, I\
      \ should recall their birth and death years. Let's start with Nietzsche. I think\
      \ he was a German philosopher. From what I remember, he lived in the 19th century.\
      \ Maybe he was born around the mid-1800s. Let me think... wasn't he born in\
      \ 1844? And he died in 1900? If that's right, he would have been 56 years old\
      \ when he died because 1900 minus 1844 is 56. Wait, but sometimes dates can\
      \ be a bit tricky if the months are involved. But since the exact dates aren't\
      \ given, I'll go with the years for approximation.\n\nNow, Indira Gandhi. She\
      \ was the Prime Minister of India, right? She was assassinated in the 1980s,\
      \ I believe. Her birth year... maybe 1917? And her death was in 1984. So 1984\
      \ minus 1917 is 67. So she would have been 67 when she died. \n\nSo comparing\
      \ the two: Nietzsche at 56 and Gandhi at 67. That would mean Nietzsche was indeed\
      \ younger when he died. Therefore, the answer should be YES. \n\nWait, but wait\
      \ a second. Let me verify those dates again to be sure. For Nietzsche: born\
      \ October 15, 1844, died August 25, 1900. So from 1844 to 1900 is 56 years,\
      \ but since his birthday is in October and he died in August, he hadn't turned\
      \ 56 yet in 1900. Wait, 1900 minus 1844 is 56 years, but since he died in August,\
      \ which is before his October birthday, he was actually 55 years old. Hmm, that's\
      \ a detail I might have missed. So if he was born in 1844 and died in 1900 before\
      \ his birthday, he was 55. Let me check that calculation again. If he was born\
      \ in 1844, then in 1900, he would have been 1900 - 1844 = 56, but only if he\
      \ lived past his birthday. Since he died in August and his birthday was in October,\
      \ he didn't reach 56. So his age at death was 55 years, 10 months, and 10 days\
      \ or something like that. So actually, 55 years old.\n\nThen Indira Gandhi:\
      \ born November 19, 1917, died October 31, 1984. So 1984 minus 1917 is 67, but\
      \ her birthday is in November, so she died in October, which is before her birthday.\
      \ So she was 66 years old at death. Wait, that changes things. Let's recalculate.\
      \ From 1917 to 1984 is 67 years, but she died before her 67th birthday. So 1984\
      \ - 1917 = 67, but since her birthday is in November and she died in October,\
      \ she was 66 years old. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me do the exact calculation.\
      \ From November 19, 1917, to November 19, 1984, would be exactly 67 years. But\
      \ she died on October 31, 1984, which is 19 days before her 67th birthday. So\
      \ her age at death was 66 years, 11 months, and 12 days. So approximately 66\
      \ years old.\n\nWait, so now if Nietzsche was 55 and Indira was 66, then the\
      \ answer is still YES, Nietzsche was younger. But maybe I made a mistake here.\
      \ Let me confirm the exact dates.\n\nLooking up (mentally) Nietzsche: born October\
      \ 15, 1844, died August 25, 1900. So from October 15, 1844, to October 15, 1900,\
      \ would be 56 years. But he died on August 25, 1900, which is about 2 months\
      \ before his 56th birthday. So his age was 55 years, 10 months, and 10 days.\
      \ So 55 years old.\n\nIndira Gandhi: born November 19, 1917, died October 31,\
      \ 1984. From November 19, 1917, to November 19, 1984, is 67 years. She died\
      \ on October 31, 1984, which is 19 days before her 67th birthday. So her age\
      \ at death was 66 years, 11 months, and 12 days. So 66 years old.\n\nWait wait,\
      \ now the problem is that if we calculate 1984 - 1917, that's 67, but since\
      \ she died before her birthday, it's 66. So Nietzsche died at 55, and Indira\
      \ at 66. So 55 vs. 66: Nietzsche was younger when he died. Therefore, the answer\
      \ is YES.\n\nBut I need to make sure I didn't mix up their birth and death dates.\
      \ Let me cross-verify. Nietzsche's death year is 1900, which is correct. Born\
      \ 1844. Indira was born 1917, died 1984. Yes. So the calculation stands. Therefore,\
      \ YES, Nietzsche was younger at the time of his death than Indira Gandhi was\
      \ at hers.\n</think>YES  \nFriedrich Nietzsche was born on October 15, 1844,\
      \ and died on August 25, 1900, making him 55 years old at his death (as he died\

      \ died on October 31, 1984, making her 66 years old at her death (as she died\
      \ just before her 67th birthday). Since 55 is younger than 66, the answer is\
      \ YES."
    cb8b0c7c-afd2-4fea-aa24-490d74c5833e: '<think>Okay, let me try to figure this
      out. The question is whether Friedrich Nietzsche was younger at his time of
      death than Indira Gandhi was at hers. So I need to find out both of their ages
      when they died and compare them.


      First, I should recall the birth and death years of both individuals. Let''s
      start with Friedrich Nietzsche. I remember he was a German philosopher. I think
      he was born in the mid-19th century. Maybe around 1844? And he died in 1900?
      Wait, wasn''t he alive at the turn of the century? I might be mixing up some
      details. Let me double-check. Nietzsche was born on October 15, 1844, and he
      died on August 25, 1900. So if he died in 1900, subtracting his birth year,
      1900 - 1844 gives 56 years old. But wait, he was born in October and died in
      August, so he hadn''t reached his 56th birthday yet. Let me calculate the exact
      age. From October 15, 1844, to October 15, 1900, would be 56 years. But he died
      in August, so two months before his birthday. So he was 55 years and 10 months
      old, approximately. So his age at death was 55 years.


      Now, Indira Gandhi. She was the Prime Minister of India, right? She was assassinated,
      I think in 1984. Her birth year... maybe around 1917? Let me confirm. Indira
      Gandhi was born on November 19, 1917, and she died on October 31, 1984. Calculating
      her age: 1984 minus 1917 is 67 years. But her birthday is in November, and she
      died in October, so she was 66 years and 11 months old. So her age at death
      was 66 years.


      So comparing the two: Nietzsche died at 55, Indira Gandhi at 66. Therefore,
      Nietzsche was younger when he died than Gandhi. Wait, but the question is asking
      if Nietzsche was younger at their time of death than Indira Gandhi was at hers.
      So yes, since 55 is less than 66. Therefore, the answer should be YES.

      </think>Friedrich Nietzsche was born on October 15, 1844, and died on August
      25, 1900, making him 55 years old at his death. Indira Gandhi was born on November
      19, 1917, and died on October 31, 1984, making her 66 years old at her death.
      Since 55 is less than 66, Nietzsche was indeed younger at the time of his death
      than Gandhi was at hers.

      \ the right historical figures. Martin Luther is the Protestant Reformer, right?\
      \ Born in 1483, died in 1546. Then Mark Twain, the American writer, Samuel Clemens,\
      \ born in 1835 and died in 1910.\n\nWait, let me double-check those dates. For\
      \ Martin Luther, yes, he was born on November 10, 1483, and died on February\

      \ would be 1546 - 1483 = 63 years old. But wait, his birth and death dates are\
      \ in different months. He was born in November and died in February. So he hadn't\

      \ is 62 years, 3 months, and a few days. So approximately 62 years old.\n\n\
      Now Mark Twain. He was born on November 30, 1835, and died on April 21, 1910.\
      \ Let's do the same calculation. 1910 - 1835 = 75. But again, check the months.\
      \ From November 30, 1835, to November 30, 1905, that's 70 years. Then from 1905\

      \ now I'm confused. Let's calculate the exact age. Mark Twain was born November\
      \ 30, 1835. On April 21, 1910, how old was he? Subtract 1835 from 1910: 75 years.\
      \ But since his birthday is in November, from November 30, 1835, to November\
      \ 30, 1909, he would be 74 years old. Then from November 30, 1909, to April\
      \ 21, 1910, that's 4 months and 21 days. So he's 74 years old at the time of\
      \ death. So his age is 74.\n\nMartin Luther was 62 when he died, and Mark Twain\
      \ was 74. So the question is: Was Martin Luther younger at his death than Mark\
      \ Twain at his? Yes, because 62 is younger than 74. Therefore, the answer is\
      \ YES.\n</think>YES. Martin Luther was 62 years old when he died in 1546, while\
      \ Mark Twain was 74 years old at his death in 1910. Thus, Martin Luther was\
      \ indeed younger at the time of his death. \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    824fd31a-be08-4d8b-bc0b-51982a3594c8: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the question is whether Martin Luther was younger at the time of his death\

      \ birth and death years of both individuals. \n\nWait, Martin Luther... there's\
      \ Martin Luther King Jr., but the question might be referring to the original\
      \ Martin Luther, the German theologian from the Protestant Reformation. And\
      \ Mark Twain is the American writer, Samuel Clemens. Let me confirm that.\n\n\
      So, Martin Luther (the reformer) was born in 1483. Let me check that. Yes, he\
      \ was born on November 10, 1483. He died on February 18, 1546. So, calculating\
      \ his age at death: 1546 minus 1483. Let's do the math. 1546 - 1483 = 63 years\
      \ old. Wait, but if he was born in November and died in February, he would have\
      \ been 63 years old, right? Because 1483 to 1546 is 63 years, and the months\
      \ would make it 63 years and a few months. So, approximately 63 years old at\
      \ death.\n\nNow, Mark Twain. His real name was Samuel Clemens. He was born on\
      \ November 30, 1835, and died on April 21, 1910. Let's calculate his age. 1910\
      \ minus 1835 is 75. But again, considering the birth and death months. He was\
      \ born in November 1835 and died in April 1910. So from November 30, 1835, to\
      \ November 30, 1909, that's 74 years. Then from November 30, 1909, to April\
      \ 21, 1910, that's about 4 months and 21 days. So he was 74 years old plus those\
      \ months, making him 74 years and about 5 months at death. Wait, but 1910 -\
      \ 1835 is 75 years, but since he died before his birthday in 1910 (November\
      \ 30), he was 74 years old. So his age at death was 74 years, 4 months, and\
      \ 21 days. So approximately 74 years old.\n\nWait, but 1910 minus 1835 is 75,\
      \ but since he hadn't reached his 75th birthday yet, he was 74. So Mark Twain\
      \ was 74 when he died. Martin Luther was 63. So the question is: Was Martin\
      \ Luther younger at his time of death than Mark Twain? So 63 vs. 74. Yes, 63\
      \ is younger than 74. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n\nWait, but let me double-check\

      \ Mark Twain: 1835-1910. 1910 - 1835 = 75, but he died in April, so he was 74.\

      Now Mark Twain. His real name was Samuel Clemens. He was born on November 30,\

      \ 1910 minus 1835 is 75, but since he died before his birthday in 1910, he was\

      \ and death years first, then calculate their ages at death and compare them.\n\
      \nFirst, I should recall who these people are. Duke Ellington was a famous jazz\
      \ musician and composer, right? I think he was active in the 20th century. Leo\
      \ Tolstoy is the Russian author of \"War and Peace\" and \"Anna Karenina,\"\
      \ so he's from the 19th century. That makes me think Tolstoy died earlier than\
      \ Ellington, but I need to check the exact dates.\n\nLet me start with Leo Tolstoy.\
      \ I remember he lived a long life. I think he was born in 1828 and died in 1910.\
      \ Let me confirm that. Yes, Tolstoy was born on September 9, 1828, and died\
      \ on November 20, 1910. So, calculating his age: 1910 minus 1828. That would\
      \ be 82 years old. Wait, 1910 - 1828 is 82. But wait, his birthday is in September\
      \ and he died in November, so he had already turned 82 that year. So yes, he\
      \ was 82 when he died.\n\nNow, Duke Ellington. He was a jazz legend. I believe\
      \ he was born in 1899. Let me check. Yes, Edward Kennedy \"Duke\" Ellington\
      \ was born on April 29, 1899. When did he die? I think he passed away in the\
      \ 1970s. Maybe 1974? Let me confirm. Yes, he died on May 24, 1974. So, calculating\
      \ his age: 1974 minus 1899. That's 75 years. But wait, his birthday is in April\
      \ and he died in May, so he had already turned 75. So he was 75 when he died.\n\
      \nComparing the two: Tolstoy was 82, Ellington was 75. So yes, Duke Ellington\
      \ was younger at the time of his death than Tolstoy. Therefore, the answer should\
      \ be YES.\n</think>To determine if Duke Ellington was younger at his death than\
      \ Leo Tolstoy:\n\n1. **Leo Tolstoy**: Born September 9, 1828; died November\
      \ 20, 1910.  \n   Age at death: \\(1910 - 1828 = 82\\) years (confirmed, as\
      \ he turned 82 in September 1910).\n\n2. **Duke Ellington**: Born April 29,\
      \ 1899; died May 24, 1974.  \n   Age at death: \\(1974 - 1899 = 75\\) years\
      \ (confirmed, as he turned 75 in April 1974).\n\n**Comparison**: Ellington (75)\
      \ was younger at death than Tolstoy (82).  \n\nANSWER: YES"

      \nFirst, I need to recall the key dates for each figure. Let's start with Nicholas\
      \ II. I know that he was the last Tsar of Russia, and he was executed during\
      \ the Russian Revolution. From history lessons, I remember that the Russian\
      \ Revolution happened around 1917-1918. Specifically, Nicholas II and his family\

    26a0f035-7422-4c8b-a141-3740aaf7c7a8: '<think>Okay, let''s see. I need to figure
      out if Nicholas II of Russia was younger when he died than Margaret Thatcher
      was when she died. Hmm.


      First, I should find out when each of them was born and when they died. Then
      calculate their ages at death. Let me start with Nicholas II. I remember that
      he was the last Tsar of Russia, killed during the Russian Revolution. I think
      he died in 1918. His birth year... I think he was born in 1868. Let me check
      that in my mind. Yes, Nicholas II was born on May 18, 1868. He died on July
      17, 1918. So to calculate his age: 1918 minus 1868 is 50 years. Wait, but he
      died in July, and his birthday was in May, so he had already turned 50 that
      year. So he was 50 years old when he died.


      Now Margaret Thatcher. She was the British Prime Minister, known as the Iron
      Lady. I think she died in 2013. Let me confirm. Yes, she died on April 8, 2013.
      Her birth date is October 13, 1925. So, she was born in 1925 and died in 2013.
      Calculating her age: 2013 minus 1925 is 88 years. But wait, her birthday is
      in October, so in April 2013, she hadn''t turned 88 yet. Wait, no. Wait, she
      was born in 1925, so 2013 minus 1925 is 88. She died in April, and her birthday
      is in October, so she was 87 years old at death? Wait, no. Let me do the exact
      calculation. From October 13, 1925, to April 8, 2013. So she would have been
      87 years and about 6 months. Wait, no. Let''s see: 2013 - 1925 = 88 years, but
      since her birthday is in October, she hadn''t reached her 88th birthday yet
      in April. So her age at death would be 87 years old. Wait, but sometimes when
      people calculate age, they count the years passed. So if she was born in 1925,
      then in 2013, she would be 2013 - 1925 = 88, but since her birthday was after
      April, she was 87 years and about 5 months old. So her age at death is 87 years
      old. Wait, maybe I should check that again. For example, if someone is born
      in 1925, on October 13, then in 2013, they would turn 88 in October. So before
      October 13, 2013, they are 87. Since she died on April 8, 2013, that''s before
      her birthday. Therefore, she was 87 when she died. So her age was 87.


      Wait, but I''m confused because sometimes sources might round differently. Let
      me think. For example, if she died in April 2013, born October 1925, then her
      exact age would be 87 years, 5 months, and some days. So yes, she was 87 at
      the time of death. So Nicholas II was 50, Thatcher was 87. So Nicholas was younger.
      Therefore, the answer is YES, because 50 is younger than 87.

      </think>Nicholas II of Russia was born on May 18, 1868, and died at age 50 on
      July 17, 1918. Margaret Thatcher was born on October 13, 1925, and died at age
      87 on April 8, 2013. Since 50 is younger than 87, the answer is YES.

      \ is 88 years. But wait, she was born in October 1925 and died in April 2013.\
      \ So she hadn't reached her 88th birthday yet. Let's calculate her exact age.\
      \ From October 13, 1925, to October 13, 2012, she would be 87. Then from October\
      \ 13, 2012, to April 8, 2013, is about 5 months and 25 days. So she was 87 years\

      First, Nicholas II. I remember he was the last Tsar of Russia, killed during
      the Russian Revolution. I think he died in 1918. Let me confirm. Yeah, Nicholas
      II was executed by the Bolsheviks in July 1918. Now, when was he born? I think
      he was born in 1868. Let me check that. Yes, Nicholas II was born on May 18,
      1868. So if he died in 1918, subtract 1868 from 1918. That would make him 50
      years old at death. Wait, 1918 minus 1868 is 50. So he was 50 when he died.


      Now, Margaret Thatcher. She was the British Prime Minister, known as the Iron

      Let me verify. Yes, she died on April 8, 2013. Her birth date was October 13,
      1925. So to find her age at death, subtract 1925 from 2013. 2013 minus 1925

      Comparing the two: Nicholas II was 50, Thatcher was 88. So yes, Nicholas II

      \ Juan Per\xF3n. I think she died relatively young. From what I remember, she\
      \ died of cancer, maybe in the 1950s? Let me check the dates. Eva Per\xF3n was\
      \ born on May 7, 1919, and she died on July 26, 1952. So, calculating her age\
      \ at death: 1952 minus 1919 is 33 years old. Wait, but she was born in May and\
      \ died in July, so she had already had her birthday that year. So yes, 33 years\
      \ old.\n\nNow, David Bowie. He was a British musician who passed away more recently.\
      \ I think he died in 2016. His birth year was 1947. Let me confirm. David Bowie\
      \ was born on January 8, 1947, and died on January 10, 2016. So, from 1947 to\
      \ 2016 is 69 years. But since he died in January 2016, he had just turned 69\
      \ two days before his death. So he was 69 years old when he died.\n\nComparing\
      \ the two: Eva Per\xF3n was 33, David Bowie was 69. So yes, Eva was younger\
      \ at the time of her death than Bowie. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n\
      </think>Eva Per\xF3n was born on May 7, 1919, and died on July 26, 1952, making\
      \ her 33 years old at her death. David Bowie was born on January 8, 1947, and\
      \ died on January 10, 2016, making him 69 years old at his death. \n\n**ANSWER:\

      \ young, in her early 30s.\n\nNow, David Bowie. He was a musician, right? I\
      \ think he died a few years ago, maybe around 2016. Let's confirm his birth\

      \ who these people are. Miguel de Cervantes was a Spanish writer, famous for\
      \ \"Don Quixote,\" right? And John McCain was a U.S. politician and senator\
      \ who ran for president. Okay, so they're from very different time periods.\
      \ Cervantes was around in the 16th-17th century, and McCain is modern, passing\

      \ Wait, didn't he die on the same date as Shakespeare? Yeah, both died in 1616,\
      \ but Cervantes actually died a few days earlier. Anyway, his lifespan would\

      \ the answer is YES.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the dates again to be\

      \ in 1616. So if he was born in 1547 and died in 1616, his age would be 1616\
      \ minus 1547. Let me do that math: 1616 - 1547. Let's subtract. 1616 minus 1500\

      \ question is whether Miguel de Cervantes was younger when he died compared\
      \ to John McCain's age at his death. I need to find out both of their ages at\
      \ the time of death and compare them.\n\nFirst, I'll start with Miguel de Cervantes.\
      \ I remember he wrote \"Don Quixote,\" which is a classic Spanish novel. When\
      \ was he born and when did he die? From what I recall, he lived during the late\
      \ 16th and early 17th centuries. Let me check the dates. I think he was born\
      \ in 1547. His death year might be 1616. So if that's correct, he died in 1616.\
      \ To find his age, subtract 1547 from 1616. Let me calculate that: 1616 minus\
      \ 1547. That's 69 years old. Wait, 1547 + 69 = 1616, yes, that seems right.\
      \ So Cervantes was 69 when he died.\n\nNow, John McCain. He was a U.S. Senator,\
      \ and I remember he passed away more recently. Let me think. He died in 2018,\
      \ I believe. When was he born? I think it was in 1936. So if he was born in\
      \ 1936 and died in 2018, his age would be 2018 minus 1936. Let me do the math:\
      \ 2018 - 1936. That equals 82 years old. So McCain was 82 when he died.\n\n\
      Comparing the two: 69 (Cervantes) vs. 82 (McCain). So Cervantes was indeed younger\
      \ at the time of his death than John McCain. Therefore, the answer should be\
      \ YES.\n</think>Miguel de Cervantes was born in 1547 and died in 1616, making\

      \ the time of his death than McCain. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    67c09eac-8c7e-4ef6-a1b2-5f52ffa51286: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Miguel de Cervantes was younger when he died than John McCain was when he\
      \ died. Let me start by recalling their birth and death dates.\n\nFirst, Miguel\
      \ de Cervantes. I remember he wrote Don Quixote. I think he lived in the late\
      \ 16th or early 17th century. Let me check. Oh right, he was born in 1547 and\
      \ died in 1616. Wait, that's the same year Shakespeare died, right? So he died\
      \ in 1616. Let me calculate his age. If he was born in 1547 and died in 1616,\
      \ subtract 1547 from 1616. 1616 minus 1547. Let's do that step by step. 1616\
      \ minus 1500 is 116, and then minus 47 more. 116 minus 47 is 69. So Cervantes\
      \ was 69 when he died.\n\nNow John McCain. He was a US senator and presidential\
      \ candidate. He passed away more recently. I think he died in 2018. His birth\
      \ year was 1936. Let me confirm. Yes, John McCain was born on August 29, 1936,\
      \ and died on August 25, 2018. To calculate his age: 2018 minus 1936. 2018 minus\
      \ 1936. Let's subtract: 1936 + 82 = 2018. Wait, 1936 + 80 is 2016, so 2018 is\
      \ 82 years. But since his death was in August 2018 and his birthday was in August,\
      \ he had just turned 81 in 2017, so wait, 2018 minus 1936 is 82, but depending\
      \ on the exact dates. He was born August 29, died August 25. So in 2018, he\
      \ would have turned 82 on August 29, but he died on August 25, four days before\
      \ his birthday. So he was 81 years old at death. Wait, so 2018 - 1936 = 82,\
      \ but since he died before his birthday, he was 81. Let me check: 1936 to 1946\
      \ is 10, then 1946 to 1956: 20, continuing... 1936 to 2006 is 70 years, then\
      \ 2006 to 2016 is 80, then 2016 to 2018 is 82. But since he died in August 2018,\
      \ and was born in August 1936, the exact age is 81 if he died before his birthday.\
      \ So August 25, 2018 is before August 29, so he was 81 years old.\n\nSo Cervantes\

      \ So, the question is whether Miguel de Cervantes was younger at the time of\

      \ out the birth and death years of both individuals and then calculate their\
      \ ages at death.\n\nStarting with Miguel de Cervantes. I remember he's the author\
      \ of Don Quixote. From what I recall, he lived during the Spanish Golden Age.\
      \ Let me think... I believe he was born in 1547. Wait, no, maybe 1547? Or was\
      \ it 1543? Hmm. And he died in 1616. Wait, 1616 is a significant year because\
      \ both Cervantes and Shakespeare died that year, right? But I think Cervantes\
      \ died a bit earlier in the year, like April, and Shakespeare in April as well,\
      \ but maybe the dates are different because of the calendar change. Anyway,\
      \ the exact date might not matter here, just the year. So if he was born in\
      \ 1547 and died in 1616, that would make him 69 years old. Wait, 1616 minus\

      \ So Cervantes was 69 when he died.\n\nNow, John McCain. He was a U.S. Senator\
      \ and presidential candidate. He passed away more recently. I think he died\
      \ in 2018. His birth year was 1936. Let me confirm. John McCain was born on\
      \ August 29, 1936, and died on August 25, 2018. So, calculating his age: 2018\
      \ minus 1936 is 82. But wait, since his birthday was in August and he died in\
      \ August, but a few days before his birthday. So he was 81 years old, turning\
      \ 82 that year. Wait, no. If he was born August 29, 1936, and died August 25,\
      \ 2018, then he was 81 years old because he hadn't reached his 82nd birthday\
      \ yet. So 2018 - 1936 = 82, but subtracting the days, he was 81 years and 360\
      \ days or something. So his age at death was 81. But sometimes, in these cases,\
      \ do they count the completed years? Hmm. Let me check. For example, if someone\
      \ is born on January 1, 2000, and dies on December 31, 2001, they are 1 year\
      \ old, not 2. So in McCain's case, since he died a few days before his birthday,\
      \ he was 81. So his age at death was 81.\n\nSo Cervantes was 69, McCain was\
      \ 81. Therefore, Cervantes was younger at the time of his death than McCain.\
      \ So the answer would be YES. Wait, but wait, let me double-check the birth\
      \ and death years again to be sure.\n\nCervantes: born 1547, died 1616. 1616\
      \ - 1547 = 69. Correct. John McCain: born 1936, died 2018. 2018 - 1936 = 82,\
      \ but since he died a few days before his 82nd birthday, he was 81. So 81 is\
      \ less than 82, but wait, no. Wait, the calculation is 2018 minus 1936 equals\
      \ 82, but because he died before his birthday, he was 81. So his age was 81.\
      \ So 69 vs. 81. Therefore, yes, Cervantes was younger. So the answer is YES.\n\

      \ more, which would be 116 - 47 = 69. So Cervantes was 69 when he died.\n\n\
      Now, John McCain. He was a U.S. Senator and a presidential candidate. He passed\

      \ McCain was 82 when he died.\n\nWait, let me double-check the birth and death\
      \ years to make sure. For Cervantes, quick search in my mind: yes, born 1547,\
      \ died April 1616. So 1616-1547 is indeed 69. John McCain was born August 29,\
      \ 1936, and died August 25, 2018. Hmm, he was just a few days short of his 82nd\
