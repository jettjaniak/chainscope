      1. First, let me find their lifespans:

      - Tchaikovsky lived from 1840 to 1893

      2. Let me calculate their ages at death:

      - Tchaikovsky: 1893 - 1840 = 53 years old at death

      1. First, let me find out when Elizabeth Taylor died and at what age:

      - Elizabeth Taylor died in 2011

      - She was born in 1932

      - She was 79 years old when she died


      2. Next, let me find out when Ruth Bader Ginsburg died and at what age:

      - RBG died in 2020

      - She was born in 1933

      3. Now I can compare their ages at death:

      - Elizabeth Taylor: 79 years

      - Ruth Bader Ginsburg: 87 years

      - 79 is less than 87


      Therefore, since Elizabeth Taylor was 79 when she died and RBG was 87, Taylor
      was younger at her time of death.

      2. Now, let me find John Paul II''s lifespan:

      - Born: May 18, 1920

      - Died: April 2, 2005

      - Age at death: 84 years old


      3. Now I can compare:

      - Conan Doyle: 71 years at death

      - John Paul II: 84 years at death

      - 71 is less than 84


      Therefore, yes, Arthur Conan Doyle was younger at his time of death than John
      Paul II at his time of death.

      2. Now, let me find out when Schindler lived and died:

      - Born: April 28, 1908

      - Died: October 9, 1974

      - Age at death: 66 years old


      3. Now I can compare their ages at death:

      - Van Gogh: 37 years

      - Schindler: 66 years

      - 37 is less than 66


      Therefore, Van Gogh was younger at his time of death than Schindler was at his
      time of death.

      - Died: March 31, 1980

      - Age at death: 66 years old


      2. Now, let me find when Henry Ford lived:

      - Born: July 30, 1863

      - Died: April 7, 1947

      - Age at death: 83 years old


      3. Now I can compare their ages at death:

      - Jesse Owens: 66 years

      - Henry Ford: 83 years

      - 66 is less than 83


      Since Jesse Owens was 66 when he died and Henry Ford was 83 when he died, Jesse
      Owens was younger at his time of death.

      - Amelia Earhart disappeared in 1937 (and was declared dead in 1939)

      - Franz Kafka died on June 3, 1924

      - He was born on July 3, 1883

      - This means he was 40 years old when he died

      - Nicholas II died in 1918

      - He was born in 1868

      - So he was 50 years old when he died


      2. Let me find when Margaret Thatcher died and at what age:

      - Margaret Thatcher died in 2013

      - She was born in 1925

      - So she was 87 years old when she died


      3. Now I can compare:

      - Nicholas II: died at 50 years old

      - Margaret Thatcher: died at 87 years old

      - 50 is less than 87


      Therefore, YES - Nicholas II was younger at his time of death than Margaret
      Thatcher was at her time of death.'
