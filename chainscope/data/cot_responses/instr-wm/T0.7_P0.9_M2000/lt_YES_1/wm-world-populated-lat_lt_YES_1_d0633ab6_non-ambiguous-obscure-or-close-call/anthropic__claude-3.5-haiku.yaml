    125fabd9-5fa2-442d-8954-8ad133b1eac6: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Clark County is located in the state of Nevada, which is in the western United
      States.


      2. London is located in the United Kingdom, which is in Europe.


      3. Nevada is west of the Atlantic Ocean, while the UK is east of the Atlantic
      Ocean.


      4. Geographically, Nevada is much further west and significantly further south
      than London.


      5. However, the specific question is whether Clark County is south of London.


      6. Since Nevada is located in the northern hemisphere and at a lower latitude
      than London, Clark County is indeed south of London.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
