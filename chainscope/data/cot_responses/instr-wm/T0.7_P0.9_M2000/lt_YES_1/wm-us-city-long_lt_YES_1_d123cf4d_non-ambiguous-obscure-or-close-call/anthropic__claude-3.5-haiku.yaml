    b64a6519-abeb-4e18-bc6a-e949efeeccfe: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s consider the geographical locations of Houston and Nashville
      within the United States.


      2. Houston is located in southeastern Texas, near the Gulf Coast.


      3. Nashville is located in central Tennessee, which is further east compared
      to Texas.


      4. To determine if Houston is west of Nashville, I''ll mentally map their relative
      positions.


      5. Texas is west of Tennessee, so cities in Texas will generally be west of
      cities in Tennessee.


      6. Houston is specifically located in the eastern part of Texas, but it is still
      west of Nashville.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES, Houston is located west of Nashville.'
