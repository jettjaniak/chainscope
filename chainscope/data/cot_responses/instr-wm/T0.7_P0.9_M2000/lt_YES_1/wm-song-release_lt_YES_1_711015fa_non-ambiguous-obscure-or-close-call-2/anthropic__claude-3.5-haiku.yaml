      1. First, I''ll find the release date of "Otis" by Kanye West (featuring Jay-Z):

      - "Otis" was released on July 23, 2011, as part of the album "Watch the Throne"


      2. Next, I''ll find the release date of Ariana Grande''s "34+35":

      - "34+35" was released on October 30, 2020, as part of her album "Positions"


      3. Comparing the two dates:

      - "Otis" was released in 2011

      - "34+35" was released in 2020

      - 2011 is earlier than 2020


      4. Therefore, Kanye West''s "Otis" was indeed released earlier than Ariana Grande''s
      "34+35".
