      Around" was released in 1964.

      1. **Identify the release date of "If You Had My Love" by Jennifer Lopez**:
      This song was released on May 4, 1999.


      2. **Identify the release date of "I Love It" by Lil Pump**: The song "I Love
      It" by Lil Pump, featuring Chris Brown, was not a direct match in my initial
      search, suggesting there might be confusion with the song title or artist. However,
      Lil Pump did release a song called "I Love It" but it seems I might have mixed
      it up with another artist''s song. The correct song "I Love It" that is well-known
      is actually by Icona Pop, featuring Charli XCX, released in 2012. But considering
      the question mentions Lil Pump, it seems there might be a mix-up. Lil Pump did
      release a song in collaboration, but the most notable "I Love It" song doesn''t
      match his discography directly as described. For the sake of clarity and assuming
      a mix-up in song titles or artists, let''s proceed with the understanding that
      "I Love It" is not a direct match for Lil Pump''s notable releases.


      3. **Determine the release order**: Given the confusion in step 2 and the correct
      identification of Jennifer Lopez''s song release in 1999, if we consider a song
      by Lil Pump or a similar artist/release, any song released after 1999 would
      be later than "If You Had My Love."


      Given the confusion with "I Love It" by Lil Pump, and assuming we are discussing
      the release dates of known songs, the closest match for confusion could be with
      Icona Pop''s "I Love It" or another song by Lil Pump. Since "If You Had My Love"
      was released in 1999, and without a clear, direct "I Love It" by Lil Pump that
      matches the query, we default to the understanding that Jennifer Lopez''s song
      was indeed released before any song that could potentially match the query from
      a later year.

      1. **Identify Release Dates**: We need to find out when Jennifer Lopez''s "If
      You Had My Love" was released and when Lil Pump''s "I Love It" was released.


      2. **Compare Release Dates**: Once we have both release dates, we can compare
      them to determine which song was released earlier.


      3. **Determine the Answer**: If "If You Had My Love" was released before "I
      Love It," the answer is YES. If "I Love It" was released before or at the same
      time as "If You Had My Love," the answer is NO.


      Given the necessary information:

      - Jennifer Lopez''s "If You Had My Love" was released on May 4, 1999.

      - Lil Pump''s "I Love It" (feat. Kanye West) was released on September 7, 2018,
      but it seems there might be confusion with another song. However, it''s clear
      that any version of "I Love It" by Lil Pump would be much later than 1999.


      Therefore, since "If You Had My Love" by Jennifer Lopez was released in 1999
      and "I Love It" by Lil Pump (or any similar song) would have been released many
      years later, the answer is:


      YES'

      song by Eminem, featuring Dr. Dre and 50 Cent. It was released in 2009 as part
      of Eminem''s sixth studio album, "Relapse".

      - Shreya Ghoshal''s "Samjhawan" was released in 2014.


      Since 2009 is earlier than 2014, Eminem''s "Crack a Bottle" was indeed released

      "R U Mine?" was released earlier than 21 Savage''s "Runnin", we need to consider
      the release dates of both songs.


      1. **Arctic Monkeys - "R U Mine?"**: This song was released in 2012 as part
      of the album "AM" but initially came out as a single in 2012, ahead of the album''s
      release in 2013.


      2. **21 Savage - "Runnin"**: Without the exact release date provided in the
      question, we must consider 21 Savage''s career timeline. 21 Savage gained popularity
      in the mid-2010s. A song titled "Runnin" is indeed part of his discography,
      but the specific release date is necessary for a precise comparison. However,
      given that 21 Savage rose to fame around 2015-2016, it''s reasonable to assume
      that most of his notable releases, including "Runnin", would be after 2012.


      Given the information and typical music release patterns, it''s logical to deduce
      that Arctic Monkeys''s "R U Mine?" was released before 21 Savage''s "Runnin",
      considering the former was out in 2012 and the latter would have been released
      sometime after 21 Savage gained popularity, which was after 2012.


      YES'

      we need to compare the release dates of two songs: "R U Mine?" by Arctic Monkeys
      and "Runnin" by 21 Savage.


      1. **Identify the release date of "R U Mine?" by Arctic Monkeys**: "R U Mine?"
      was released in 2012.


      2. **Identify the release date of "Runnin" by 21 Savage**: Without the specific
      release date of "Runnin" by 21 Savage in the provided information, we need to
      rely on general knowledge. Assuming "Runnin" is a known song by 21 Savage, we
      would typically look up its release date. However, for the sake of this exercise,
      let''s proceed with the understanding that we''re comparing the release years
      of songs by these artists.


      3. **Compare the release dates**: Knowing that "R U Mine?" was released in 2012,
      we need to establish if "Runnin" by 21 Savage was released before or after this
      date. Without the exact release date of "Runnin," we consider 21 Savage''s rise
      to fame and the release of his notable works. 21 Savage gained prominence in
      the mid to late 2010s, suggesting that many of his popular songs, including
      potential collaborations or solo works like "Runnin," could have been released
      after 2012.


      Given the steps above and considering typical music release patterns, it''s
      reasonable to infer that "R U Mine?" by Arctic Monkeys was likely released before

      of both songs.


      1. **Lorde''s "Team" Release Date**: "Team" is a song by Lorde, from her debut
      studio album "Pure Heroine". It was released as a single on December 13, 2013.
