      we need to determine the locations of University of Georgia (UGA) and University
      of Michigan College of Engineering (UMICH), and then compare their geographical
      positions.


      1. **Identify the location of University of Georgia:** UGA is located in Athens,
      Georgia. Georgia is generally considered part of the southeastern United States.


      2. **Identify the location of University of Michigan College of Engineering:**
      UMICH is located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Michigan is generally considered part
      of the northern United States.


      3. **Compare the general north-south positions of Georgia and Michigan:** Georgia
      is generally south of Michigan.


      4. **Determine if UGA is south of UMICH**: Since Georgia is south of Michigan,
      any location in Georgia (including UGA) would be south of any location in Michigan
      (including UMICH).


      Given these steps, the answer to whether University of Georgia, GA, is located
      south of University of Michigan College of Engineering, MI, is: **YES**'
