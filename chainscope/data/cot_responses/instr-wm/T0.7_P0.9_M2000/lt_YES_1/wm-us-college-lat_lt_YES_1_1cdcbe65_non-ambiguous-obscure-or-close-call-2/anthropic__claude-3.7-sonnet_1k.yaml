      Since Columbia University (and its School of International and Public Affairs)

      - Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine is located in Ithaca, NY


      ## Step 2: Compare their geographic positions

      - Columbia University (including its School of International and Public Affairs)
      is farther south

      - Cornell University (including its College of Veterinary Medicine) is farther

      New England states.

      - Tennessee (TN) is in the southeastern United States, substantially south of
      Massachusetts.


      Since Tennessee is south of Massachusetts, and Vanderbilt University is in Tennessee
      while Northeastern University is in Massachusetts, it follows that Vanderbilt
      University is located south of Northeastern University.

      To figure this out, I need to determine the geographical locations of both institutions.


      Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.

      New York University (NYU) Graduate School of Arts and Science is located in
      New York City, New York.


      Now I need to determine if Baltimore is south of New York City. Looking at a
      mental map of the US East Coast, going from north to south:

      - Maine

      - New Hampshire

      - Vermont

      - Massachusetts

      - Rhode Island

      - Connecticut

      - New York (where NYC is located)

      - New Jersey

      - Pennsylvania

      - Delaware

      - Maryland (where Baltimore is located)

      - Virginia

      - etc.


      So Maryland is south of New York. Therefore, Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,
      Maryland is located south of NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science in New
      York City, New York.</think>I need to determine if Johns Hopkins University
      in Maryland is located south of NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science in New
      York.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.

      - NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science is located in New York City, New York.


      Step 2: Compare the geographic positions.

      - On the U.S. East Coast, New York is further north than Maryland.

      - Maryland sits below New York State on a map, with New Jersey and Pennsylvania
      in between.

      - Baltimore (where Johns Hopkins is) is approximately 200 miles south of New
      York City.


      Step 3: Make a conclusion based on geographical position.

      Since Maryland is south of New York on the map, Johns Hopkins University is
      located south of NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science.

      Now I need to determine their relative positions. In the US, Illinois is south

      - Wisconsin is a northern state that borders Michigan, Minnesota, Iowa, and
      Illinois.

      - Illinois is directly south of Wisconsin.


      So geographically, any location in Illinois would be south of any location in

      To determine whether the College of the University of Chicago (in Illinois)
      is south of the University of Wisconsin-Madison College of Engineering (in Wisconsin),
      I need to consider their geographic locations.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - The University of Chicago is located in Chicago, Illinois (IL)

      - The University of Wisconsin-Madison is located in Madison, Wisconsin (WI)


      ## Step 2: Compare geographic positions

      - Wisconsin is a northern state that borders Illinois along its southern border

      - Illinois is directly south of Wisconsin

      - Chicago is in northeastern Illinois

      - Madison is in southern Wisconsin


      ## Step 3: Determine relative positions

      Since any location in Illinois is south of any location in Wisconsin (as Wisconsin
      is entirely north of Illinois), the University of Chicago must be south of the
      University of Wisconsin-Madison.

      to determine the relative positions of University of California, Santa Barbara
      (UCSB) and Stanford University in California.


      Step 1: Let me determine where UCSB is located.

      UCSB is located in Santa Barbara, California, which is on the central California
      coast.


      Step 2: Let me determine where Stanford University is located.

      Stanford University is located in Stanford, California, which is near Palo Alto
      in the San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California.


      Step 3: Compare their north-south positions.

      California generally extends from north to south along the west coast of the
      United States. The San Francisco Bay Area (where Stanford is) is in Northern
      California, while Santa Barbara is in the central California coast.


      This means that Santa Barbara is south of the San Francisco Bay Area, so UCSB
      is south of Stanford University.</think>I''ll think through this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) is located in Santa Barbara,
      on California''s central coast.

      - Stanford University is located in Stanford/Palo Alto in the San Francisco
      Bay Area of Northern California.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on California''s north-south axis.

      - California extends along the west coast from north to south.

      - The San Francisco Bay Area (where Stanford is) is in Northern California.

      - Santa Barbara is located on the central California coast, south of the Bay
      Area.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Since Stanford is in the Bay Area (Northern California) and UCSB is on the
      central California coast, UCSB is positioned south of Stanford.


      YES, University of California, Santa Barbara is located south of Stanford University.'

      University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) is located in Santa Barbara,
      CA, which is on the central California coast.


      In terms of north-south positioning in California:

      - Stanford is in the northern part of California (though not far north, it''s
      in the Bay Area)

      - Santa Barbara is further south along the coast, between the Bay Area and Los
      Angeles

      is located along the central coast between the Bay Area and Los Angeles.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Moving from north to south down the California coast, you would encounter Stanford
      before reaching Santa Barbara.
