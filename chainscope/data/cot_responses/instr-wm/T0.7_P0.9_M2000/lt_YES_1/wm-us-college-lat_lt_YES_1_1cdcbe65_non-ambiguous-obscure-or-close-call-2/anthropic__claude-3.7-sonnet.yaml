      - University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) is located in Santa Barbara,
      California, on the central California coast.

      - Stanford University is located in Stanford, California, which is in the San
      Francisco Bay Area in northern California.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on California''s north-south axis.

      - Santa Barbara is located on the central California coast, approximately 100
      miles northwest of Los Angeles.

      - Stanford is located near Palo Alto in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is
      in northern California.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - California generally runs north-south along the Pacific coast.

      - The San Francisco Bay Area (where Stanford is) is farther north than Santa
      Barbara.

      - Therefore, Santa Barbara (where UCSB is) is south of the San Francisco Bay
      Area.
