      1. First, let''s locate Lake Victoria geographically:

      - Lake Victoria is located in East Africa

      - Specifically, it is situated in the countries of Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania

      - It is part of the African Great Lakes region


      2. Next, let''s consider the location of the Great Lakes:

      - The Great Lakes are located in North America

      - They are situated between the United States and Canada

      - They include Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario


      3. Comparing the locations:

      - Lake Victoria is in Africa

      - The Great Lakes are in North America

      - These are on different continents


      4. Determining relative position:

      - Since Lake Victoria is in Africa and the Great Lakes are in North America

      - Lake Victoria is indeed south of the Great Lakes


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
