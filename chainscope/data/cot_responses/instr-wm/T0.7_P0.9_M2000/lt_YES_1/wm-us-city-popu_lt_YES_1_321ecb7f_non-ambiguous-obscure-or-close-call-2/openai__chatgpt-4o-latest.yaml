    d2c7e5e0-5506-48b1-a44d-86a86a4f2ef3: 'To answer whether Miami Beach, FL is less
      populous than Los Angeles, CA, we need to compare the populations of the two
      cities.


      Step 1: Determine the population of Miami Beach, FL.

      - Miami Beach is a relatively small city located in Miami-Dade County.

      - As of the most recent estimates (2020 Census and subsequent updates), Miami
      Beach has a population of approximately 80,000 to 90,000 residents.


      Step 2: Determine the population of Los Angeles, CA.

      - Los Angeles is the largest city in California and the second-largest city
      in the United States.

      - Los Angeles has a population of nearly 4 million people.


      Step 3: Compare the two populations.

      - Miami Beach: ~90,000

      - Los Angeles: ~4,000,000


      Clearly, Los Angeles has a vastly higher population than Miami Beach.
