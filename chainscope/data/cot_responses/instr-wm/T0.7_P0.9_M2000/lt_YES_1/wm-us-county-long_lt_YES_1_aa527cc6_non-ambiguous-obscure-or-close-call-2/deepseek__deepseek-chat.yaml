      down step by step:


      1. **Locate Maricopa County, AZ**: Maricopa County is in the state of Arizona,
      which is in the southwestern part of the United States. Arizona is in the Mountain
      Standard Time Zone (MST) and is west of the Mississippi River.


      2. **Locate the District of Columbia, DC**: The District of Columbia is on the
      East Coast of the United States, bordering Maryland and Virginia. It is in the
      Eastern Standard Time Zone (EST).


      3. **Compare their positions**: The United States spans from the East Coast
      (where DC is located) to the West Coast. Arizona, including Maricopa County,
      is significantly farther west than DC.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Maricopa County, AZ is in the southwestern U.S. and
      the District of Columbia, DC is on the East Coast, Maricopa County is indeed
      west of DC.
