      we need to determine the geographical locations of Dallas County, TX, and Miami-Dade
      County, FL, and then compare their positions relative to each other.


      1. **Identify the location of Dallas County, TX**: Dallas County is located
      in the state of Texas, in the southern United States. Texas is situated in the
      south-central part of the country.


      2. **Identify the location of Miami-Dade County, FL**: Miami-Dade County is
      located in the state of Florida, in the southeastern United States. Florida
      is a state situated in the far southeastern corner of the country, with Miami-Dade
      County being at its southern end.


      3. **Compare the locations**: To determine if Dallas County, TX, is west of
      Miami-Dade County, FL, we need to understand the general geography of the United
      States. Florida is located to the east of Texas. Miami-Dade County, being in
      southeastern Florida, extends into the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern edge. Dallas
      County, Texas, is landlocked and is situated more centrally within the southern
      United States but is still to the west of Florida.

      3. **Consider the longitudinal positions**: Since we''re comparing east-west
