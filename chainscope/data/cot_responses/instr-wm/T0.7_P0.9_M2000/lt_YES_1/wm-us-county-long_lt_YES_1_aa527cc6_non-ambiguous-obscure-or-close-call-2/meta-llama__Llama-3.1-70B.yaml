      1. **Identify the locations**: Los Angeles County, CA, is located on the West
      Coast of the United States, while Nassau County, NY, is located on the East
      Coast.


      2. **Compare the locations**: Since the United States is generally oriented
      with the West Coast to the west and the East Coast to the east, anything on
      the West Coast is west of anything on the East Coast.


      3. **Conclusion**: Given that Los Angeles County, CA, is on the West Coast and
      Nassau County, NY, is on the East Coast, Los Angeles County, CA, is indeed located
      west of Nassau County, NY.
