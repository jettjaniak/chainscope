      \ population density is typically measured, and then comparing the areas in\
      \ question. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Understanding Zip Codes**: Zip codes\
      \ are postal codes used by the United States Postal Service (USPS) to identify\
      \ specific geographic areas within the country. Each zip code represents a distinct\
      \ postal area, which can range from a small town to a large city or even multiple\
      \ cities.\n\n2. **Identifying Locations**: \n   - The zip code 70116 refers\
      \ to a location in Louisiana (LA).\n   - The zip code 10011 refers to a location\
      \ in New York (NY), specifically in Manhattan, New York City.\n\n3. **Population\
      \ Density**: Population density is calculated by dividing the number of people\
      \ in a given area by the size of that area (typically in square miles or square\
      \ kilometers). Areas with higher population densities have more people per unit\
      \ of area.\n\n4. **Comparing Areas**: \n   - **70116, LA**: This zip code is\

      \ densely populated urban areas in the United States. Manhattan is known for\
      \ its high-rise buildings and extremely high population density, especially\

      \ locations**: \n   - 90265 corresponds to Malibu, California.\n   - 55425 corresponds\
      \ to Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\n2. **Understand what the question is asking**:\
      \ The question is about comparing the population density of two areas, not the\
      \ population size. Population density is the number of people per unit area,\
      \ typically measured in people per square mile or square kilometer.\n\n3. **Research\
      \ population densities**:\n   - For 90265 (Malibu, CA), according to the US\
      \ Census Bureau or other reliable sources, we need to find the population density.\
      \ Malibu is known for being a coastal city with a mix of urban and rural areas,\
      \ but without exact figures, we can't make a direct comparison.\n   - For 55425\
      \ (Minneapolis, MN), similarly, we need the population density. Minneapolis\
      \ is a more urban area compared to Malibu, which might imply a higher population\

      \   - Without exact numbers, we can make an educated guess based on the nature\
      \ of the areas. Urban areas like parts of Minneapolis tend to have higher population\
      \ densities compared to more suburban or rural areas like parts of Malibu. However,\
      \ Malibu, being in California and near Los Angeles, might still have a significant\
      \ population density due to its desirability and the general population density\
      \ of coastal California.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that Minneapolis\
      \ (55425) is a urban area and Malibu (90265) has areas that are less densely\

      Given the above reasoning and the need for specific population density data\

      populated than 55425, MN, we should follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the zip codes**: The two zip codes in question are 90265 (California)
      and 55425 (Minnesota).


      2. **Find population data**: We need to find the population of each zip code.
      However, without access to real-time data or specific databases, we can use
      general knowledge and data sources like the United States Census Bureau for
      this kind of information. As of my last update, I don''t have real-time access
      to current population figures by zip code, but we can proceed with the understanding
      that this step involves looking up the population figures for each zip code.


      3. **Find area data**: To calculate density, we also need the land area of each
      zip code. Like population data, this can be found through the Census Bureau
      or other geographic information systems.


      4. **Calculate density**: Density is calculated by dividing the population by
      the land area. The formula is: Density = Population / Land Area. The units are
      typically people per square mile or square kilometer.


      5. **Compare densities**: Once we have the density of each zip code, we can
      compare them to determine which one is less densely populated.


      Given the hypothetical nature of this exercise and without current, specific
      data on the population and land area of 90265, CA, and 55425, MN, let''s proceed
      with a general understanding:


      - **90265, CA** is located in California, which is known for having densely
      populated areas, especially around cities like Los Angeles. However, without
      knowing the specific location within California (e.g., urban, suburban, or rural
      area), it''s hard to generalize its population density.


      - **55425, MN** is in Minnesota, which has areas of high population density,
      particularly around Minneapolis, but also has large rural areas with lower densities.


      Without specific data, a definitive answer can''t be provided based on general
      knowledge alone. However, for the purpose of this exercise and acknowledging
      the lack of specific data:


      Given the general trend that California tends to have higher population densities
      than Minnesota, especially in certain areas, but acknowledging that 90265 could
      be in a less densely populated part of California and 55425 could be in a more
      densely populated part of Minnesota (near Minneapolis, for example), it''s a
      complex comparison without specific data.


      For the sake of providing a formatted answer as requested, and considering the
      need for actual data to make an accurate comparison:

      1. **Identify the zip codes**: We have two zip codes, 89109 (located in Nevada,
      NV) and 10019 (located in New York, NY).


      2. **Understand what "less densely populated" means**: This phrase refers to
      the population density, which is the number of people per unit area (usually
      square miles or square kilometers).


      3. **Find the population density of each zip code**: To compare the population
      densities, we need data on the number of residents and the land area of each
      zip code. However, without access to real-time data or specific databases, we''ll
      have to rely on general knowledge or previous data (which might not be up-to-date).


      4. **Compare the population densities**: Once we have the population densities,
      we can compare them to determine if 89109, NV is less densely populated than
      10019, NY.


      Given the constraints of not having immediate access to the most current data,
      we''ll rely on general trends and knowledge about these areas:

      its urban sprawl and relatively low population density compared to other major
      U.S. cities, especially when considering its surrounding areas.


      - **10019, NY**: This zip code is located in Manhattan, New York City. Manhattan
      is one of the most densely populated urban areas in the world, known for its
      high-rise buildings and compact living spaces.


      Based on these general characteristics:


      - Manhattan (10019, NY) is known for being extremely densely populated.

      - Las Vegas (89109, NV), while having dense areas, tends to have a lower overall
      population density due to its sprawling nature.


      **Conclusion**: Given the general trends and without specific, up-to-date data,
      it''s reasonable to infer that 89109, NV (Las Vegas) would be less densely populated

      a series of steps:


      1. **Identify the Locations**: First, we need to identify the locations associated
      with the zip codes 94301 and 11201. The zip code 94301 is located in California
      (CA), and 11201 is located in New York (NY).


      2. **Determine the Cities**: Next, we determine the cities or areas these zip
      codes represent. The zip code 94301 is associated with Palo Alto, California,
      and 11201 is associated with Brooklyn, New York.


      3. **Research Population Density**: We then need to research the population
      density of these areas. Population density is typically measured by the number
      of people per square mile or square kilometer.


      4. **Compare Population Densities**: Once we have the population densities for
      both areas, we can compare them to determine which one is less densely populated.


      Given the general knowledge about these areas:

      - Palo Alto, California (94301), is in the San Francisco Bay Area, known for
      its tech industry and educational institutions. It has a significant population
      but is not as densely populated as major urban centers like New York City.

      - Brooklyn, New York (11201), is a borough of New York City, one of the most
      densely populated cities in the United States.


      Based on this general knowledge, without needing the exact population density
      figures, it is reasonable to infer that Brooklyn, NY (11201), being part of

      \n3. **Find the population and area for each zip code**:\n   - This step involves\
      \ looking up the population and land area for each zip code to calculate the\
      \ density.\n   - **For 94301, CA (Palo Alto, CA)**: As of my last update, the\
      \ population of Palo Alto is around 67,000, and the land area is approximately\
      \ 25.8 square miles.\n   - **For 11201, NY (Brooklyn, NY)**: This zip code is\
      \ part of Brooklyn, which has a large and dense population. The population within\
      \ this specific zip code area is densely packed, with Brooklyn as a whole having\

      \ This zip code is located in Manhattan, New York City. According to the US\
      \ Census data, the population density of Manhattan is very high, and this specific\
      \ zip code covers a very small area with a high population. The exact population\
