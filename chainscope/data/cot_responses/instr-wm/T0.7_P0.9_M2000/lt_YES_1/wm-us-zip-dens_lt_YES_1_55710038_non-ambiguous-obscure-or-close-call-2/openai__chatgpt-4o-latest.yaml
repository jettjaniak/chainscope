      to compare the population densities of these two ZIP codes. Population density
      is typically measured as the number of people per square mile or square kilometer.


      Step 1: Identify the locations

      - ZIP code 70116 is located in New Orleans, Louisiana, and includes parts of
      the French Quarter and surrounding neighborhoods.

      - ZIP code 10011 is located in Manhattan, New York City, and includes parts
      of neighborhoods such as Chelsea and the West Village.


      Step 2: Understand the urban context

      - Manhattan is one of the most densely populated areas in the United States.

      - While New Orleans is a major city, it is significantly less densely populated
      than Manhattan.


      Step 3: Check estimated population and area sizes (based on publicly available
      data)

      - 70116 typically has a population of around 10,000 to 12,000 people and covers
      a relatively small area, but not as compact as Manhattan ZIP codes.

      - 10011 has a population closer to 50,000 to 60,000 people and is also relatively
      small in area, contributing to a high population density.

      - Because 10011 has a significantly higher population in a comparably small
      area, its population density is much higher than that of 70116.

      to understand and compare the population densities of both ZIP codes. Population
      density is typically measured as the number of people per square mile.


      Step 1: Identify the locations and characteristics of the ZIP codes.


      - ZIP code 90069 is in West Hollywood, California. It includes parts of West
      Hollywood and adjacent areas of Los Angeles.

      - ZIP code 10036 is in Manhattan, New York City. It includes parts of Midtown
      Manhattan, including the Theater District and Times Square.


      Step 2: Understand population density trends.


      - Manhattan (where 10036 is located) is one of the most densely populated areas
      in the United States, with very high population density due to its high-rise
      residential buildings and limited land area.

      - West Hollywood (where 90069 is located) is also densely populated, but generally
      less so than central Manhattan. It has a mix of mid-rise and low-rise buildings,
      and overall a smaller population density compared to Manhattan.


      Step 3: Look at approximate data (based on census and demographic sources):


      - ZIP code 10036 has an estimated population density of around 70,000 to 80,000
      people per square mile.

      - ZIP code 90069 has an estimated population density closer to 12,000 to 15,000
      people per square mile.


      Step 4: Compare the densities.


      - Clearly, 10036 (NY) has a significantly higher population density than 90069
      (CA).

      Step 2: Understand the general characteristics of these areas.

      - Nantucket is an island and a well-known tourist destination. Its population
      is relatively small, and the area is geographically larger and more spread out.

      - The Upper West Side of Manhattan is an urban area with high-rise apartment
      buildings and a large residential population in a small geographic area.


      Step 3: Check available data or make an informed estimation.

      - Nantucket (02554) has a population of around 10,000 to 12,000 people year-round,
      with a land area of approximately 45 square miles. This gives a rough density
      of about 250 people per square mile.

      - The Upper West Side (10023) has a population of over 60,000 people in a much
      smaller area, approximately 0.6 square miles. This results in a population density
      of over 100,000 people per square mile.


      Step 4: Compare the densities.

      - 02554: ~250 people/sq mi

      - 10023: >100,000 people/sq mi


      Conclusion: 02554 is much less densely populated than 10023.

      Nevada is less densely populated than 10019 in New York, we need to examine
      population density, which is generally measured as the number of people per
      square mile.


      Step 1: Understand the locations.

      - Zip code 89109 is in Las Vegas, Nevada. It includes parts of the Las Vegas
      Strip and some surrounding residential and commercial areas.

      - Zip code 10019 is in Manhattan, New York City. It includes part of Midtown
      Manhattan, such as the Theater District and Hell''s Kitchen.


      Step 2: General knowledge of population density.

      - Manhattan is one of the most densely populated areas in the United States.
      Most zip codes in Manhattan have very high population densities.

      - Las Vegas, while a major city, has a much lower overall population density
      compared to Manhattan.


      Step 3: Look at population and area estimates.

      - 89109 (Las Vegas, NV): Has a population of around 20,000-25,000 people, and
      covers a relatively large area with a lot of commercial space (hotels, casinos),
      which reduces residential density.

      - 10019 (New York, NY): Has a population of around 50,000-60,000 people in a
      much smaller area, and includes many high-rise residential buildings.


      Step 4: Compare densities.

      - 10019 has a much higher number of residents packed into a smaller area.

      - 89109 has fewer residents and more commercial space, meaning lower residential
      density.
