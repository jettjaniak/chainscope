    ceebd128-22c4-4a5a-8112-e4b3fedc1064: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, 90069 is a zip code in West Hollywood, California

      - This is an urban area in Los Angeles

      - Known to be a relatively compact, densely populated neighborhood


      2. 10036 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York City

      - Located in the heart of Midtown Manhattan

      - One of the most densely populated areas in the United States


      3. Manhattan is famously known for extremely high population density

      - High-rise buildings

      - Compact urban layout

      - Very little open space


      4. While West Hollywood is also urban, it is less densely packed compared to
      Midtown Manhattan

      - More spread out

      - Lower building heights

      - Less compact street grid


      5. Therefore, 90069 (West Hollywood) is less densely populated than 10036 (Midtown
      Manhattan)
