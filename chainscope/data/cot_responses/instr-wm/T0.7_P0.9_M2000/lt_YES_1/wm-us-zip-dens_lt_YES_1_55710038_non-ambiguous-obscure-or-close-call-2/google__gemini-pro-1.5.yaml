      90265 corresponds to Malibu, CA, a coastal city known for its affluence and
      large properties. 55425 corresponds to a part of Minneapolis, MN, a major metropolitan
      area.


      2. **Consider typical population density:** Coastal California cities, especially
      affluent ones like Malibu, tend to have lower population densities due to larger
      lot sizes and restrictions on development.  Minneapolis, as a large city, is
      expected to have a much higher population density.


      3. **Inference:**  Given the locations and their typical characteristics, it
      is highly likely that Malibu (90265) has a lower population density than Minneapolis

      and affluent residents, but also incorporating some mountainous, less densely
      populated areas. 55425 corresponds to a part of Minneapolis, Minnesota, a major
      city.


      2. **Consider typical urban vs. suburban/rural densities:** Generally, major
      cities have higher population densities than suburban or rural areas, and coastal
      areas can be less dense due to geographical constraints.  Malibu, despite its
      affluence, has geographical limitations (mountains, coastline) that restrict
      dense housing. Minneapolis, as a major city, is expected to be densely populated.
