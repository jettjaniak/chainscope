      - Palm Beach County is in Florida (FL), on the southeastern coast of the state.

      - New York County is in New York (NY), which is Manhattan in New York City.


      Step 2: Consider their geographical positions in the United States.

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Maricopa County is in Arizona (AZ)

      - King County is in Washington state (WA)


      Step 2: Consider their geographical positions within the United States.

      - Washington state is in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States, bordering Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Washington state is much further north in the US than Arizona

      - King County (which contains Seattle) is in the western part of Washington
      state

      - Maricopa County (which contains Phoenix) is in the central part of Arizona


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      - All of Arizona, including Maricopa County, is south of Washington state

      - Therefore, Maricopa County must be south of King County


      YES, Maricopa County, AZ is located south of King County, WA.'
