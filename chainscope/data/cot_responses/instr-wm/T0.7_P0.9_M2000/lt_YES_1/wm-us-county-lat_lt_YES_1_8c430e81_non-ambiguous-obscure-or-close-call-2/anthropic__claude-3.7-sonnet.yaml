      - Palm Beach County is in Florida (FL), on the southeastern coast of the state.

      - New York County is in New York (NY), which is Manhattan in New York City.


      Step 2: Consider their geographical positions in the United States.

      - New York is in the northeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Florida is generally south of New York state.

      - Palm Beach County is on the southeast coast of Florida.

      - New York County (Manhattan) is in the southern part of New York state.

      - All of Florida, including Palm Beach County, is located south of even the
      southernmost part of New York state.


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Washington state is in the northwestern United States, bordering Canada

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States, bordering Mexico


      Step 3: Compare their latitudes.

      - Washington state is much further north in the US than Arizona

      - King County (which contains Seattle) is in the western part of Washington
      state

      - Maricopa County (which contains Phoenix) is in the central part of Arizona


      Step 4: Make the north-south comparison.

      - All of Arizona, including Maricopa County, is south of Washington state

      - Therefore, Maricopa County must be south of King County
