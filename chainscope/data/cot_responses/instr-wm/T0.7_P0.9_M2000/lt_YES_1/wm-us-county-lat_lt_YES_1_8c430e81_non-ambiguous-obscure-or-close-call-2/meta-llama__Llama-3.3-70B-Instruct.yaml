      2. **Understand the general geography of the United States**: Arizona is located
      in the southwestern part of the United States, while Washington is in the Pacific
      Northwest.

      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Generally, the southwestern states (like Arizona)
      are at a lower latitude (further south) than the Pacific Northwest states (like
      Washington).

      4. **Consider specific county locations**: Maricopa County, where Phoenix is
      located, is in the southern part of Arizona. King County, where Seattle is located,
      is in the western part of Washington, near the Canadian border.

      5. **Latitude comparison**: Since Arizona is south of Washington, and considering
      that Maricopa County is in the south of Arizona, it is reasonable to conclude
      that Maricopa County, AZ is indeed south of King County, WA.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is: **YES**'
