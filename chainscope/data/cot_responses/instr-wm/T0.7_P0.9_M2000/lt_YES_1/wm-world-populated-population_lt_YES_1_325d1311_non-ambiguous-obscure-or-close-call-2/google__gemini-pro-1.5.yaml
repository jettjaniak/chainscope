      The population of Mecca vs. the population of Greater Cairo.

      2. **What defines "Greater Cairo"?**  Greater Cairo typically refers to the
      Cairo metropolitan area, which encompasses a significantly larger area than
      the city of Mecca.

      3. **General knowledge:** Cairo is one of the largest cities in Africa and the
      Middle East, while Mecca, although a major holy city, is smaller in terms of
      overall urban area and general population.


      Therefore, it is highly probable that Mecca is less populous than Greater Cairo.
