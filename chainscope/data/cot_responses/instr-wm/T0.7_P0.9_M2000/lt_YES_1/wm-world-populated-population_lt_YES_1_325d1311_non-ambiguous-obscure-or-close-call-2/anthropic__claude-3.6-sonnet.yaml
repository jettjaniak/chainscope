      1. First, I need to identify "Australia, Cuba" - this appears to be a typo or
      confusion, as Australia and Cuba are separate places. I''ll assume the question
      is about Cuba since it''s being compared to a region in France.


      2. Let me check Cuba''s population:

      - Cuba has approximately 11.3 million people


      3. Now, let me check Normandy''s population:

      - Normandy (French region) has approximately 3.3 million people


      4. Compare the numbers:

      - Cuba: 11.3 million

      - Normandy: 3.3 million

      1. First, I notice there''s an error in the question - Casablanca is in Morocco
      and Havana is in Cuba. These are two different cities, not one place.


      2. Since the question appears to be comparing with Moscow, I''ll consider both
      cities separately:


      3. Population figures (approximate):

      - Moscow: ~12.5 million people

      - Casablanca: ~3.4 million people

      - Havana: ~2.1 million people


      4. Even if we were to combine Casablanca and Havana''s populations (which would
      be ~5.5 million), it would still be less than Moscow''s population.


      5. Therefore, whether considering either city individually or even hypothetically
      combined, both are less populous than Moscow.


      YES (Casablanca and Havana, whether separate or combined, are less populous
      than Moscow)'

      - Mumbai''s metropolitan area has approximately 20-21 million people


      3. Compare the numbers:

      - Mumbai is India''s largest city

      - Mumbai''s population is approximately 20.4 million (metropolitan area)


      2. Let me recall Bangkok''s population:

      - Bangkok is Thailand''s capital and largest city

      - Bangkok''s metropolitan area population is approximately 14.6 million


      3. Comparing the numbers:

      - Mumbai: 20.4 million

      - Bangkok: 14.6 million

      - 20.4 million > 14.6 million

      - Therefore, Mumbai has a larger population than Bangkok


      4. Since the question asks if Bangkok is less populous than Mumbai, and we found
      that Bangkok indeed has fewer people...


      YES'
