      1. First, let''s consider the population of Cairo:

      - Cairo is the capital of Egypt

      - It is a major metropolitan area

      - Cairo''s population is around 9.5 million people in the city proper, and over
      20 million in the greater metropolitan area


      2. Now, let''s consider Capri:

      - Capri is a small island in Italy

      - It is a popular tourist destination

      - It is a very small place

      - Its permanent population is around 12,000 people


      3. Comparing the two:

      - Cairo has a population of about 9.5 million

      - Capri has a population of about 12,000

      - 9.5 million is much larger than 12,000
