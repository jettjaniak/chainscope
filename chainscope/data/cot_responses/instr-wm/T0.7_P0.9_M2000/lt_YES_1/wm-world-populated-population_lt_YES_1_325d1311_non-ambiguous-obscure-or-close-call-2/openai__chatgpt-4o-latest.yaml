      Step 1: Understand what Machupicchu District is.

      - Machupicchu District is a district in the Urubamba Province in the Cusco Region
      of Peru.

      - It includes the famous archaeological site of Machu Picchu.

      - It is a small, rural district with a relatively low population.

      - According to the most recent census data (as of around 2017), the population
      of Machupicchu District is approximately 5,000 to 6,000 people.


      Step 2: Understand what Long Island is.

      - Long Island is a large, densely populated island in the southeastern part
      of New York State, USA.

      - It includes Brooklyn and Queens (parts of New York City), as well as Nassau
      and Suffolk counties.

      - The population of Long Island (excluding Brooklyn and Queens) is over 7 million
      people.

      - Even considering just Nassau and Suffolk counties, the population is well
      over 2 million.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      - Machupicchu District: ~5,000 to 6,000 people.

      - Long Island: Millions of people.


      Step 4: Determine which is more populous.

      - Clearly, Long Island is vastly more populous than Machupicchu District.

      - Australia is a country and continent with a population of around 26 million

      - Normandy is a region in northern France with a population of about 3 million.

      - So, Australia is much more populous than Normandy.

      - Cuba is an island nation in the Caribbean with a population of about 11 million.

      - Australia + Cuba = 26 million + 11 million = ~37 million.

      is less populous than Casablanca, Morocco, we need to compare the population
      figures of both cities.


      **Step 1: Find the population of San Juan, Puerto Rico.**

      San Juan is the capital and largest city of Puerto Rico. As of recent estimates
      (2020-2023), the population of San Juan is approximately 320,000 people within
      the city proper. The metropolitan area has over 2 million people, but for a
      fair comparison, we will use city proper populations unless otherwise specified.


      **Step 2: Find the population of Casablanca, Morocco.**

      Casablanca is the largest city in Morocco. Its city proper population is over
      3 million people, with the metropolitan area exceeding 4 million. Even using
      just the city proper, Casablanca is significantly more populous than San Juan.


      **Step 3: Compare the two populations.**

      - San Juan: ~320,000 (city proper)

      - Casablanca: ~3,000,000 (city proper)


      **Conclusion:** Casablanca has a much larger population than San Juan.

      the east, the Hudson River to the west, 59th Street to the south, and 110th
      Street to the north.

      - **Central Athens (regional unit)**: A much larger administrative region in
      Greece that includes the central part of the Athens metropolitan area. It encompasses
      several municipalities and is part of the Attica region.


      Step 2: Find population data.


      - **Upper West Side**: According to U.S. Census data and other sources, the
      population of the Upper West Side is around 210,000 to 220,000 people.

      - **Central Athens (regional unit)**: According to recent data from the Hellenic
      Statistical Authority, the population of the Central Athens regional unit is
      approximately 1.5 million people.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.


      - Central Athens has a population of over 1 million.

      - The Upper West Side has a population of just over 200,000.


      Conclusion: The Upper West Side is significantly less populous than Central
      Athens (regional unit).

    8b503359-2341-4471-abfd-9be82438e26c: 'To determine whether El Cairo (Cairo, Egypt)
      is less populous than Holland (commonly referring to the Netherlands as a whole,
      although Holland is technically a region within the Netherlands), we need to
      compare the population of the city of Cairo with the population of the country
      of the Netherlands.


      Step 1: Understand what is meant by "El Cairo."

      - "El Cairo" is the Spanish name for Cairo, the capital city of Egypt.


      Step 2: Determine the population of Cairo.

      - As of recent estimates (2024), the metropolitan area of Cairo has a population
      of over 20 million people.


      Step 3: Understand what is meant by "Holland."

      - Holland is often used to refer to the entire country of the Netherlands, although
      technically, it is a region within the country.

      - For population comparison purposes, we will assume the question refers to
      the Netherlands as a whole.


      Step 4: Determine the population of the Netherlands.

      - As of 2024, the population of the Netherlands is approximately 17.5 million
      people.


      Step 5: Compare the populations.

      - Cairo: ~20 million

      - Netherlands: ~17.5 million


      Conclusion:

      Cairo is more populous than the Netherlands.

      \ **Understanding \"El Cairo\"**: \"El Cairo\" is the Spanish name for Cairo,\

      \ city of Cairo.\n\n2. **Understanding \"Holland\"**: \"Holland\" is often used\
      \ informally to refer to the Netherlands, but technically, Holland is a region\

      \   - If \"Holland\" refers only to the provinces of North and South Holland.\n\
      \   - If \"Holland\" refers to the entire country of the Netherlands.\n\n3.\

      is less populous than Greater Boston, we need to determine the population of
      each region.


      Step 1: Understand what "Province of Venice" refers to.

      - The Province of Venice (Provincia di Venezia) was an administrative division
      in the Veneto region of Italy. As of 2015, it was replaced by the Metropolitan
      City of Venice.

      - For population purposes, we can consider the numbers around the time before
      the change. The population of the Province of Venice was approximately 850,000
      to 900,000 people.


      Step 2: Understand what "Greater Boston" refers to.

      - Greater Boston is a metropolitan region centered around the city of Boston,
      Massachusetts, USA.

      - It includes the city of Boston and surrounding cities and towns. Definitions
      vary, but the U.S. Census Bureau''s Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) for
      Boston is often used.

      - According to recent estimates, the Greater Boston area has a population of
      about 4.9 million people (as of early 2020s).


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      - Province of Venice: ~850,000 to 900,000 people.

      - Greater Boston: ~4.9 million people.

    e22f97e3-ea6f-404d-b180-0530bad691fc: 'To answer whether Luxor is less populous
      than the Canary Islands, we need to compare the populations of both places.


      Step 1: Understand what Luxor is.

      Luxor is a city in Egypt. It is known for its archaeological significance and
      is one of the country''s major tourist destinations. As of recent estimates,
      the population of Luxor city is approximately 500,000 to 600,000 people. If
      considering the wider Luxor Governorate, the population may be closer to 1 million.


      Step 2: Understand what the Canary Islands are.

      The Canary Islands are an autonomous community of Spain located off the northwest
      coast of Africa. They consist of several islands, including Tenerife, Gran Canaria,
      Lanzarote, and others. The total population of the Canary Islands is over 2
      million people.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      Even if we consider the wider Luxor Governorate with a population around 1 million,
      the total population of the Canary Islands is more than double that.


      Conclusion: Luxor (whether the city or the governorate) has a smaller population
      than the Canary Islands.
