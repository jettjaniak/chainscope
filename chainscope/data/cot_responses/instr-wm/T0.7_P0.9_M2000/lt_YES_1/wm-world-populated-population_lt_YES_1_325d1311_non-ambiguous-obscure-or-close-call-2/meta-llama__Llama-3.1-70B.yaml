      we need to compare the population of South Beach and Berlin.


      1. South Beach is a neighborhood in Miami Beach, Florida, United States. It''s
      known for its beaches, nightlife, and tourism. While it''s a popular area, it''s
      not a large city.


      2. Berlin, on the other hand, is the capital and largest city of Germany. It''s
      a major global city with a large population.


      3. The population of South Beach is not as straightforward to determine, as
      it''s part of Miami Beach, which has a population of around 92,000 people. However,
      South Beach is a smaller fraction of that.

      let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Find the population of Colombia**: Colombia is a country in South America.
      As of my last update, Colombia has a population of approximately 50.9 million
      people.


      2. **Find the population of Cuba**: Cuba is an island nation in the Caribbean.

      3. **Add the populations of Colombia and Cuba**: To get the total population

      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Find the population of Ibiza**: Ibiza is an island located in the Mediterranean
      Sea and is part of the Balearic Islands, which are an autonomous community of
      Spain. As of my last update, the population of Ibiza is around 147,914 people.


      2. **Find the population of Miami-Dade County**: Miami-Dade County is located
      in the state of Florida, United States. As of my last update, the population
      of Miami-Dade County is approximately 2,716,940 people.


      3. **Compare the populations**: Now, we compare the two populations. Ibiza has
      about 147,914 people, and Miami-Dade County has about 2,716,940 people.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since 147,914 (Ibiza) is less than 2,716,940 (Miami-Dade
      County), Ibiza is indeed less populous than Miami-Dade County, Florida.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      but we can estimate it by looking at the population of the larger area it''s
      part of.


      2. Central Athens is a regional unit in Attica, Greece. It includes the city
      of Athens and its immediate surroundings. The population of Central Athens,
      as of my last update, is around 1.3 million people.


      3. The Upper West Side is part of Manhattan, which has a population of about
      1.6 million people as of my last update. The Upper West Side is a smaller part
      of this, so its population is likely to be less than that of Central Athens.


      Given these comparisons, the answer is:


      YES'

      Athens (regional unit)."


      2. **Determine the population of Upper West Side**: The Upper West Side is a

      208,374.


      2. Stockholm''s urban area, on the other hand, is a metropolitan area in Sweden
      that includes the city of Stockholm and its surrounding areas. As of my last
      update, the population of Stockholm''s urban area was about 1.6 million.

      1. **Identify the population of City of Sydney**: City of Sydney is the central
      business district and local government area of Sydney, Australia. As of my last
      update, the population of City of Sydney is approximately 208,374 people.


      2. **Identify the population of Stockholm urban area**: Stockholm urban area
      refers to the metropolitan area of Stockholm, Sweden. The population of Stockholm
      urban area is about 1.6 million people.


      3. **Compare the populations**: To determine if City of Sydney is less populous
      than Stockholm urban area, we compare the two populations. City of Sydney has
      about 208,374 people, while Stockholm urban area has about 1.6 million people.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since 208,374 (City of Sydney) is less than 1,600,000 (Stockholm
      urban area), City of Sydney is indeed less populous than Stockholm urban area.
