      1. **90265, CA**: This zip code is primarily associated with Malibu, California.
      Malibu is a coastal city known for its beaches, luxury homes, and as a residence
      for many celebrities. It is relatively low in population compared to urban areas.


      2. **10014, NY**: This zip code is part of Manhattan, specifically covering
      parts of the West Village and Greenwich Village. Manhattan is densely populated,
      and these neighborhoods are known for their high population density, cultural
      significance, and urban environment.


      Based on the typical characteristics of these areas:


      - Malibu (90265) is a smaller, more residential, and less densely populated
      area.

      - The West Village and Greenwich Village (10014) in Manhattan are densely populated
      urban neighborhoods.

      \ NV is less populous than 90028, CA, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify\
      \ the areas:** \n   - Zip code 89109 is in Las Vegas, Nevada. This area includes\
      \ parts of the Las Vegas Strip, which is a major tourist destination and has\
      \ a mix of residential and commercial properties.\n   - Zip code 90028 is in\
      \ Los Angeles, California. This area includes parts of Hollywood, which is also\
      \ a significant tourist and residential area.\n\n2. **Population characteristics:**\n\
      \   - Both areas are well-known for tourism, which means they have a significant\
      \ transient population due to visitors.\n   - The residential population can\
      \ differ based on the density of housing and local urban planning.\n\n3. **Data\
      \ collection:** \n   - Typically, for specific data such as population in zip\
      \ codes, one would consult census data or local government resources. However,\
      \ I don't have real-time access to databases or the internet.\n\n4. **General\
      \ knowledge and reasoning:**\n   - Los Angeles, being a larger city than Las\

      \ significant populations, zip code 90028 in Los Angeles is generally expected\
      \ to have a higher residential population than 89109 in Las Vegas due to the\

      1. **ZIP Code 89109, NV**: This ZIP code is located in Las Vegas, Nevada, and
      includes parts of the Las Vegas Strip. It is a high-traffic tourist area with
      numerous hotels and casinos. While it has a significant transient population
      due to tourism, the residential population is relatively modest compared to
      some other areas in Las Vegas.


      2. **ZIP Code 90028, CA**: This ZIP code is located in Los Angeles, California,
      and covers parts of Hollywood. Like 89109, it is also a high-traffic tourist
      area, known for attractions like the Hollywood Walk of Fame. However, it also
      includes a considerable residential population.


      To accurately answer the question, we''d need specific population data for each
      ZIP code. However, given that 90028 encompasses a dense urban area in Los Angeles,
