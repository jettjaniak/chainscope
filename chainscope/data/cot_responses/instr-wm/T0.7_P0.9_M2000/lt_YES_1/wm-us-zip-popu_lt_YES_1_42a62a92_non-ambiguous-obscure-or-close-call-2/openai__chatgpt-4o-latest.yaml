      is less populous than 10024 in New York, we need to compare the population of
      each zip code.


      Step 1: Identify the location of each zip code.

      - 70112 is a zip code in New Orleans, Louisiana. It covers parts of the downtown
      and Central Business District areas.

      - 10024 is a zip code in New York City, specifically in the Upper West Side

      - 70112 is primarily a commercial and business district, with some residential
      buildings, but generally not a densely populated residential area.

      - 10024 is a heavily residential neighborhood in a densely populated city, with
      many apartment buildings and residential infrastructure.


      Step 3: Look at population data.

      While exact numbers may vary slightly by year, public data from sources like
