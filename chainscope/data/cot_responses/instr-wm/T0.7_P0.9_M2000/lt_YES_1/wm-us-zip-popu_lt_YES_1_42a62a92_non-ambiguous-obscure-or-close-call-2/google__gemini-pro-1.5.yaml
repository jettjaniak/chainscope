      where 10025 is located) is known for its extremely high population density.  New
      Orleans, while a sizable city, has a considerably lower population density.


      3. **Intuitive guess:** It''s highly likely 10025, NY has a larger population
      than 70116, LA.

      Since I cannot access and process real-time data, I cannot definitively answer
      YES or NO.  However, general knowledge suggests that Manhattan (10014) is very
      densely populated, while Malibu (90265), although affluent, likely has a lower
      population density. Therefore, a reasonable guess would be YES, but this is
      not confirmed with data.

      being affluent and having large properties, potentially suggesting a lower population
      density. New York City (10014 - Union Square area) is a densely populated urban
      area, suggesting a higher population.  Therefore, we might hypothesize that
      90265 is less populous.

      states:** 89109 in Nevada (NV) and 90028 in California (CA).


      2. **Recognize the need for population data:**  To compare populations, we need
      to find population data associated with each zip code.


      3. **Consider resources for population data:**  Various online resources (like
      the U.S. Census Bureau or other demographic data websites) provide zip code
      population estimates.


      4. **(Hypothetical data retrieval) Assume we find the population data:**  Let''s
      *imagine* for this exercise we find that 89109 has a population of X and 90028
      has a population of Y. (We can''t actually look up this data in real-time).


      5. **Compare the populations:**  Determine if X is less than Y.


      6. **Answer the question:** If X < Y, then the answer is YES. If X >= Y, then
      the answer is NO.


      Since I cannot access and process real-time data, I cannot definitively answer
      YES or NO. I''ve outlined the necessary steps, but lack the data retrieval component.
