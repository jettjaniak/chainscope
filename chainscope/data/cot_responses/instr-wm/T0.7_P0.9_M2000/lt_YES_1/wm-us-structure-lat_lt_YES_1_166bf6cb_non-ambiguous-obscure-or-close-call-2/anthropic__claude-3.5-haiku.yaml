      1. Apple Park is located in Cupertino, California, which is in the western part
      of the United States.


      2. The United States Capitol is located in Washington, DC, which is on the eastern
      side of the United States.


      3. California is west of Washington, DC, which means Apple Park is geographically
      west of the Capitol.


      4. When comparing locations on a map from north to south, something west of
