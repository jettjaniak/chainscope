      1. Mount Carmel Center in Texas

      2. Fenway Park in Massachusetts


      To determine if one is south of the other, I need to compare their latitudes.
      A location with a lower latitude is south of a location with a higher latitude.


      First, let me identify where these places are:


      Mount Carmel Center was a compound in Texas near Waco, Texas (known for the
      1993 siege involving the Branch Davidians).


      Fenway Park is a baseball stadium in Boston, Massachusetts.


      Now I need to consider their relative positions:

      - Texas is in the southern United States

      - Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States


      Generally speaking, any location in Texas would be south of any location in
      Massachusetts because Texas is much further south than Massachusetts.

      Step 2: Compare their geographical positions within the United States.

      - Texas is located in the southern United States.

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States.


      Step 3: Consider north-south orientation specifically.

      - States in the northeastern US (like Massachusetts) are significantly further
      north than states in the southern US (like Texas).

      - This means Texas has a lower latitude than Massachusetts.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific locations.

      - Mount Carmel Center, being in Texas, must be at a lower latitude than Fenway
      Park, which is in Massachusetts.

      - Lower latitude means further south.
