      \ (37.3349\xB0 N) is less than that of the United States Capitol (38.8951\xB0\
      \ N), Apple Park is located south of the United States Capitol in terms of latitude.\n\
      \nTherefore, based on the latitudes, the answer to whether Apple Park, CA is\
      \ located south of the United States Capitol, DC is: **YES**."
    fd84d303-4474-47bd-ba8c-8410bbf79027: "To answer this question,\
      \ let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify the locations**: Apple Park\
      \ is located in Cupertino, California (CA), and the United States Capitol is\
      \ in Washington, D.C. (DC).\n\n2. **Understand geographical positions**: \n\
      \   - California (CA) is on the West Coast of the United States.\n   - Washington,\
      \ D.C. (DC) is on the East Coast of the United States, roughly in the middle\
      \ in terms of north-south positioning but definitely east.\n\n3. **Determine\
      \ north-south orientation**:\n   - The question asks if Apple Park (CA) is south\
      \ of the United States Capitol (DC). \n   - California is generally southwest\
      \ of Washington, D.C. in terms of overall U.S. geography.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n\
      \   - Since California is to the southwest of Washington, D.C., and considering\
      \ the north-south axis, California (and thus Apple Park) is indeed south of\
      \ Washington, D.C.\n\nBased on these steps, the answer to whether Apple Park,\
      \ CA is located south of the United States Capitol, DC is: **YES**."

      \ north to south means starting from the northernmost parts of the country and\
      \ heading towards the southernmost parts.\n\n3. **Determine the relative positions\
      \ of California and Washington, D.C.**: California is on the West Coast, and\
      \ Washington, D.C. is on the East Coast. However, for the purpose of determining\
      \ north-south orientation, we consider their latitudes.\n\n4. **Compare latitudes**:\
      \ \n   - The latitude of Cupertino, California (Apple Park) is approximately\
      \ 37.33\xB0N.\n   - The latitude of Washington, D.C. (United States Capitol)\
      \ is approximately 38.90\xB0N.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since 37.33\xB0N (Cupertino,\
      \ CA) is less than 38.90\xB0N (Washington, D.C.), Cupertino, CA is south of\
      \ Washington, D.C.\n\nGiven these steps, the answer is: **YES**"
