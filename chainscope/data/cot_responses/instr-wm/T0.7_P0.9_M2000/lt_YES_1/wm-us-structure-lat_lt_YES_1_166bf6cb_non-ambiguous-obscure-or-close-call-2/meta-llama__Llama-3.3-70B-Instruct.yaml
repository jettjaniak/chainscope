      \ N) is less than that of the United States Capitol (38.8951\xB0 N), Apple Park\
      \ is located south of the United States Capitol in terms of latitude.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ based on the latitudes, the answer to whether Apple Park, CA is located south\
      \ of the United States Capitol, DC is: **YES**."

      \ down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify the locations**: Apple Park is located in\
      \ Cupertino, California (CA), and the United States Capitol is in Washington,\
      \ D.C. (DC).\n\n2. **Understand geographical positions**: \n   - California\
      \ (CA) is on the West Coast of the United States.\n   - Washington, D.C. (DC)\
      \ is on the East Coast of the United States, roughly in the middle in terms\
      \ of north-south positioning but definitely east.\n\n3. **Determine north-south\
      \ orientation**:\n   - The question asks if Apple Park (CA) is south of the\
      \ United States Capitol (DC). \n   - California is generally southwest of Washington,\
      \ D.C. in terms of overall U.S. geography.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since\
      \ California is to the southwest of Washington, D.C., and considering the north-south\
      \ axis, California (and thus Apple Park) is indeed south of Washington, D.C.\n\
      \nBased on these steps, the answer to whether Apple Park, CA is located south\
      \ of the United States Capitol, DC is: **YES**."

      \ means starting from the northernmost parts of the country and heading towards\
      \ the southernmost parts.\n\n3. **Determine the relative positions of California\
      \ and Washington, D.C.**: California is on the West Coast, and Washington, D.C.\
      \ is on the East Coast. However, for the purpose of determining north-south\
      \ orientation, we consider their latitudes.\n\n4. **Compare latitudes**: \n\
      \   - The latitude of Cupertino, California (Apple Park) is approximately 37.33\xB0\
      N.\n   - The latitude of Washington, D.C. (United States Capitol) is approximately\
      \ 38.90\xB0N.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since 37.33\xB0N (Cupertino, CA) is less\
      \ than 38.90\xB0N (Washington, D.C.), Cupertino, CA is south of Washington,\
      \ D.C.\n\nGiven these steps, the answer is: **YES**"
