      1. **Identify the locations**: The Beverly Hills Hotel is in Beverly Hills,
      California, while the George Bush Center for Intelligence is in Langley, Virginia
      (not Maryland as mentioned in the question).

      2. **Understand geographic directions**: South refers to the direction towards

      \ CA is located south of the United States Capitol, DC, we need to consider\
      \ the geographical locations of both.\n\n1. **Location of Apple Park, CA**:\
      \ Apple Park is located in Cupertino, California, which is in the western part\
      \ of the United States.\n\n2. **Location of United States Capitol, DC**: The\
      \ United States Capitol is located in Washington, D.C., which is in the eastern\
      \ part of the United States.\n\n3. **Comparing Latitudes**: To determine if\
      \ one location is south of another, we compare their latitudes. The location\
      \ with the lower latitude is south of the location with the higher latitude.\n\
      \n4. **Latitude of Cupertino, CA (Apple Park)**: Cupertino, California has a\
      \ latitude of approximately 37.3228\xB0 N.\n\n5. **Latitude of Washington, D.C.\
      \ (United States Capitol)**: Washington, D.C. has a latitude of approximately\
      \ 38.9072\xB0 N.\n\nSince 37.3228\xB0 N (Cupertino, CA) is less than 38.9072\xB0\
      \ N (Washington, D.C.), Cupertino, CA (and thus Apple Park) is south of Washington,\
      \ D.C. (and thus the United States Capitol).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: **YES**"
    cdb97e2a-eaff-4d11-b759-058fd2ff330d: 'To determine if Apple Park,
      CA is located south of the United States Capitol, DC, let''s break down the
      steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Apple Park is located in Cupertino, California,
      and the United States Capitol is located in Washington, D.C.

      2. **Understand geographic directions**: South refers to the direction towards
      the South Pole. In the context of the United States, locations in the southern
      part of the country are generally south of those in the northern part.

      3. **Compare the general locations of California and Washington, D.C.**: California
      is on the West Coast of the United States, while Washington, D.C. is on the
      East Coast.

      4. **Consider the latitudes**: California is generally south of Washington,
      D.C. This is because California is located at a lower latitude than Washington,
      D.C.

      5. **Conclusion**: Given that California (where Apple Park is located) is generally
      south of Washington, D.C. (where the United States Capitol is located), Apple
      Park, CA would indeed be south of the United States Capitol, DC.


      The final answer is: YES
