      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Mount Carmel Center is in Texas (TX)

      - Fenway Park is in Massachusetts (MA)


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions geographically.

      - Texas is located in the southern United States

      - Massachusetts is located in the northeastern United States

      - Geographically, Texas is south of Massachusetts


      Step 3: Since Mount Carmel Center is in Texas, and Texas is south of Massachusetts
      where Fenway Park is located, Mount Carmel Center must be south of Fenway Park.
