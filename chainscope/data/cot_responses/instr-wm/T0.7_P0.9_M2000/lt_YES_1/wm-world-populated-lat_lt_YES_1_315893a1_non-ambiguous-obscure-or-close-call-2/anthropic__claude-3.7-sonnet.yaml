      \nLet me think through this step by step:\n\n1) Coney Island is a neighborhood\

      2) The United States is located in North America, while Ireland is in northwestern\
      \ Europe.\n\n3) In terms of latitude (north-south positioning):\n   - Ireland\
      \ is located roughly between 51.5\xB0 and 55.5\xB0 North latitude\n   - New\
      \ York City, including Coney Island, is located at approximately 40.6\xB0 North\
      \ latitude\n\n4) Since Coney Island is at a lower latitude (40.6\xB0 N) than\
      \ Ireland (51.5\xB0-55.5\xB0 N), Coney Island is farther south than Ireland.\n\
      \n5) Being \"south of\" Ireland means having a lower latitude number in the\
