      is ambiguous. It could mean south of *both* cities, or south of a line connecting

      is slightly north of Casablanca.  Since the question mentions "Casablanca, Havana"
      it can be interpreted as a single location using the more northern latitude
      of the two. Thus, we''re essentially comparing Bangalore''s location to approximately
