      is ambiguous. It could mean south of *both* cities, or south of a line connecting

      *both* Casablanca and Havana.

      4. **North/South Relationship (Casablanca & Havana):** Casablanca is significantly
      east of Havana, but the question asks about the North/South relationship. Havana
      is slightly north of Casablanca.  Since the question mentions "Casablanca, Havana"
      it can be interpreted as a single location using the more northern latitude
      of the two. Thus, we''re essentially comparing Bangalore''s location to approximately
      the latitude of Havana.

      south of Havana (and Casablanca).
