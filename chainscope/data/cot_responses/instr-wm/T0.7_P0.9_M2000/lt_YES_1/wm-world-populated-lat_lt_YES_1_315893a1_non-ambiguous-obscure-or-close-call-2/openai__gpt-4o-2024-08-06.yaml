      Denmark, which is located in Northern Europe. Geographically, it is situated
      at approximately 55.7 degrees North latitude.


      2. **Identify the location of Catalonia**: Catalonia is an autonomous community
      in northeastern Spain. Its capital, Barcelona, is located at approximately 41.4
      degrees North latitude.


      3. **Compare the latitudes**: Catalonia, at around 41.4 degrees North, is located
      further south than Copenhagen, which is at 55.7 degrees North.


      Given this analysis, the answer is YES, Catalonia is located south of Copenhagen.'
