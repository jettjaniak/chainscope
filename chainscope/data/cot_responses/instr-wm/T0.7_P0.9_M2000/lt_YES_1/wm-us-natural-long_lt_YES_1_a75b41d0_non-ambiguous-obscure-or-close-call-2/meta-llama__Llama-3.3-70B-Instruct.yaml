    25c5afad-3abd-4371-a9f5-1317af8e5311: 'To determine if the Teton
      Range in Wyoming (WY) is located west of Lake Erie in Ohio (OH), we need to
      consider the geographical locations of both.


      1. **Identify the location of Lake Erie, OH**: Lake Erie is one of the Great
      Lakes, located in the northeastern part of the United States. It borders the
      state of Ohio to the south.


      2. **Identify the location of the Teton Range, WY**: The Teton Range is a mountain
      range of the Rocky Mountains, located in the state of Wyoming. Wyoming is situated
      in the western United States.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since Wyoming is in the western United States
      and Ohio (where Lake Erie is located) is in the eastern United States, any location
      in Wyoming, including the Teton Range, would be west of Lake Erie in Ohio.


      Therefore, based on the geographical positions of Wyoming and Ohio, the Teton
      Range in Wyoming is indeed located west of Lake Erie in Ohio.


      YES.'

      3. **Consider the general east-west layout of the US**: The United States can
      be broadly divided into east and west by the Mississippi River, though this
      is not a strict geographical divide. States to the west of this divide are generally
      considered part of the "West," while states to the east are considered part
      of the "East."


      4. **Specific locations**: The Teton Range in Wyoming is significantly west
      of the Mississippi River, placing it firmly in the western United States. Lake
      Erie, being part of the Great Lakes and bordering Ohio, is east of the Mississippi
      River, placing it in the eastern United States.
