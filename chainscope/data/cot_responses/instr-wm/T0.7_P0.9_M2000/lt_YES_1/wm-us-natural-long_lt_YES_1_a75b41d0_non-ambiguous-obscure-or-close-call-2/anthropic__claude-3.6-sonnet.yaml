    2bba3b10-0b81-412f-8c8a-c8445e06ba4c: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, located on the border between the US
      and Canada

      2) Lake Erie is positioned in the northeastern part of the US, specifically
      touching Ohio''s northern border

      3) The Teton Range is a mountain range in Wyoming, part of the Rocky Mountains

      4) Wyoming is located in the western United States

      5) When comparing east-west positions in the US, anything in Wyoming would be
      west of Ohio

      6) Therefore, the Teton Range must be west of Lake Erie
