      \ Wyoming is located west of Lake Erie in Ohio, let's break this down step by\
      \ step:\n\n1. **Locate the Teton Range, WY**: The Teton Range is a mountain\
      \ range in northwestern Wyoming, near the border with Idaho. It is part of the\
      \ Rocky Mountains and is situated in the western United States.\n\n2. **Locate\
      \ Lake Erie, OH**: Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes and is located in the\
      \ northeastern part of the United States. Ohio borders the southern shore of\
      \ Lake Erie.\n\n3. **Compare their longitudes**: The Teton Range is located\
      \ at approximately **110.5\xB0 W** longitude, while Lake Erie, OH, is located\
      \ at approximately **82.5\xB0 W** longitude. In the coordinate system, a more\
      \ negative longitude value indicates a location further west.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\
      \ Since **110.5\xB0 W** (Teton Range) is further west than **82.5\xB0 W** (Lake\
      \ Erie), the Teton Range is indeed located west of Lake Erie, OH.\n\n**Answer:\

      1. **Locate the Teton Range, WY**: The Teton Range is a mountain range in northwestern
      Wyoming, part of the Rocky Mountains.


      2. **Locate Lake Erie, OH**: Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, located along

      United States, while Ohio is in the eastern part of the country. The Teton Range
      is significantly further west than Lake Erie.
