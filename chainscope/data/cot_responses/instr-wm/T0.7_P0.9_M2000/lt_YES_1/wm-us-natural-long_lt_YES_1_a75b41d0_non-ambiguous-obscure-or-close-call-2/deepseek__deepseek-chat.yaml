      \ Teton Range in Wyoming is located west of Lake Erie in Ohio, let's break this\
      \ down step by step:\n\n1. **Locate the Teton Range, WY**: The Teton Range is\
      \ a mountain range in northwestern Wyoming, near the border with Idaho. It is\
      \ part of the Rocky Mountains and is situated in the western United States.\n\
      \n2. **Locate Lake Erie, OH**: Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes and is located\
      \ in the northeastern part of the United States. Ohio borders the southern shore\
      \ of Lake Erie.\n\n3. **Compare their longitudes**: The Teton Range is located\
      \ at approximately **110.5\xB0 W** longitude, while Lake Erie, OH, is located\
      \ at approximately **82.5\xB0 W** longitude. In the coordinate system, a more\
      \ negative longitude value indicates a location further west.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\

      by step:


      1. **Locate the Teton Range, WY**: The Teton Range is a mountain range in northwestern
      Wyoming, part of the Rocky Mountains.


      2. **Locate Lake Erie, OH**: Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, located along
      the border of the northeastern United States (including Ohio) and Canada.

      United States, while Ohio is in the eastern part of the country. The Teton Range
      is significantly further west than Lake Erie.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since the Teton Range is in the western U.S. and Lake Erie
