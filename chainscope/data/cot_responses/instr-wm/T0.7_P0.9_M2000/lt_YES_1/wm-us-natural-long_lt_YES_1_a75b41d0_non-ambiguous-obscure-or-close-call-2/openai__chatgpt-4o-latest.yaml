      \ Wyoming is located west of Lake Erie in Ohio, let's go through the reasoning\
      \ step by step:\n\n1. **Location of Teton Range, WY**:  \n   The Teton Range\
      \ is a mountain range located in northwestern Wyoming. It is part of the Rocky\
      \ Mountains and includes Grand Teton National Park.\n\n2. **Location of Lake\
      \ Erie, OH**:  \n   Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes and is located on the\
      \ northern border of Ohio. Ohio is an eastern U.S. state compared to Wyoming.\n\
      \n3. **Geographic Orientation**:\n   - Wyoming is in the western part of the\
      \ United States.\n   - Ohio is located in the northeastern part of the Midwest\
      \ region.\n   - Therefore, geographically, Wyoming is west of Ohio.\n\n4. **Relative\
      \ Longitudes**:\n   - The Teton Range lies roughly around 110\xB0W longitude.\n\
      \   - Lake Erie is around 81\xB0W longitude.\n   - Since 110\xB0W is a greater\
      \ longitude (further west) than 81\xB0W, the Teton Range is indeed west of Lake\
      \ Erie.\n\nFinal Answer: **YES**."
