      1) Let me identify the locations: Teton Range is in Wyoming (WY), and Lake Erie
      borders Ohio (OH).


      2) To determine their relative positions, I need to consider their general locations
      within the United States.


      3) Wyoming is located in the western part of the United States, in the Rocky
      Mountain region.


      4) Ohio is located in the eastern part of the United States, in the Midwest/Great
      Lakes region.


      5) Lake Erie specifically is on the northern border of Ohio, one of the Great
      Lakes.


      6) The Teton Range is in western Wyoming, near the Idaho border.


      7) Since Wyoming is entirely west of Ohio, and the Teton Range is in Wyoming,
      while Lake Erie borders Ohio, the Teton Range must be west of Lake Erie.


      YES, the Teton Range, WY is located west of Lake Erie, OH.'

      1) The Teton Range is a mountain range located in Wyoming (WY), in the western
      United States.


      2) Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes located on the border between the United
      States and Canada, with part of its southern shore in Ohio (OH).


      3) Geographically, Wyoming is in the western part of the United States, while
      Ohio is in the eastern part of the country.


      4) The United States generally extends from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to
      the Pacific Ocean in the west.


      5) Since Wyoming is in the western US and Ohio is in the eastern US, Wyoming
      (and therefore the Teton Range) is west of Ohio (and therefore Lake Erie).

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both places.

      - Teton Range is in Wyoming (WY), in the western United States.

      - Lake Erie is on the border of Ohio (OH), in the eastern part of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions on a west-east axis.

      - Wyoming is located in the Rocky Mountain region of the western United States.

      - Ohio is located in the Midwest/Great Lakes region, much further east.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Wyoming is several states west of Ohio.

      - The Teton Range, being in Wyoming, must therefore be west of Lake Erie, which
      borders Ohio.


      Answer: YES, the Teton Range, WY is located west of Lake Erie, OH.'

      5) Looking at a mental map of the United States, Wyoming is in the Rocky Mountain
      region, while Ohio borders the Great Lakes region, with Wyoming being several
      states to the west of Ohio.

      part of the United States.

      4) Wyoming is significantly west of Ohio on a map of the United States.

      5) Therefore, the Teton Range (in Wyoming) must be west of Lake Erie (in Ohio).

      in Wyoming is located west of Lake Erie in Ohio.


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both places.

      - The Teton Range is a mountain range located in northwestern Wyoming.

      - Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, located on the northern border of Ohio.


      Step 2: Consider the general geography of the United States.

      - Wyoming is in the western part of the United States.

      - Ohio is in the eastern/midwestern part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - Wyoming is significantly west of Ohio.

      - Since the Teton Range is in Wyoming and Lake Erie borders Ohio, the Teton
      Range must be west of Lake Erie.


      YES, the Teton Range in Wyoming is located west of Lake Erie in Ohio.'
