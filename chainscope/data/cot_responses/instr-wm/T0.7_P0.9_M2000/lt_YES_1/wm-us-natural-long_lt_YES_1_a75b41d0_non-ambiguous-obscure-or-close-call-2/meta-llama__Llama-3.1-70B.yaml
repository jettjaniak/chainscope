    0ca13d9d-7844-46b0-8e79-55de1bffe58a: 'To determine if the Teton
      Range in Wyoming (WY) is located west of Lake Erie in Ohio (OH), let''s break
      it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: The Teton Range is located in the western United
      States, specifically in Wyoming. Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, located
      in the northeastern United States, bordering the state of Ohio among others.


      2. **Consider the general geography**: Wyoming, where the Teton Range is located,
      is in the western part of the United States. Ohio, where Lake Erie is located,
      is in the eastern part of the United States.


      3. **Compare locations**: Since Wyoming is west of Ohio, any location in Wyoming,
      including the Teton Range, would be west of any location in Ohio, including
      Lake Erie.


      Therefore, the Teton Range in Wyoming is indeed west of Lake Erie in Ohio.


      The answer is: YES

      Range, WY is located west of Lake Erie, OH, let''s break down the steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: The Teton Range is located in Wyoming (WY), and
      Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, with parts of it bordering the state of
      Ohio (OH).


      2. **Understand the geography of the United States**: Wyoming is in the western
      United States, known for its mountainous regions, including the Teton Range.
      Ohio, on the other hand, is in the eastern United States, part of the region
      often referred to as the Midwest.


      3. **Consider the general east-west layout of the US**: The United States can
      be broadly divided into east and west by the Mississippi River, though this
      is not a strict geographical divide. States to the west of this divide are generally
      considered part of the "West," while states to the east are considered part
      of the "East."


      4. **Specific locations**: The Teton Range in Wyoming is significantly west
      of the Mississippi River, placing it firmly in the western United States. Lake
      Erie, being part of the Great Lakes and bordering Ohio, is east of the Mississippi
      River, placing it in the eastern United States.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Wyoming (and thus the Teton Range) is west of
      the general east-west divide of the United States and Ohio (and thus Lake Erie)
      is east of this divide, the Teton Range, WY is indeed located west of Lake Erie,
      OH.


      The final answer is: YES
