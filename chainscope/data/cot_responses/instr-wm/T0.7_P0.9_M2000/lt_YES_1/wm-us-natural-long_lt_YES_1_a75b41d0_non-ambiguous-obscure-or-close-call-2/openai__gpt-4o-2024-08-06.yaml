      the steps:


      1. Identify the location of the Teton Range: The Teton Range is located in northwestern
      Wyoming.

      2. Identify the location of Lake Erie: Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes,
      situated on the border between the United States and Canada, to the north of
      Ohio.

      3. Determine the relative positions: Wyoming is located in the western part
      of the United States, whereas Ohio is in the eastern part.


      Based on these steps, the Teton Range in Wyoming is indeed west of Lake Erie
      in Ohio.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'

      Wyoming is located west of Lake Erie in Ohio, we can follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the location of the Teton Range**: The Teton Range is located
      in the northwestern part of Wyoming, primarily within Grand Teton National Park.


      2. **Identify the location of Lake Erie**: Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes
      and is located in the northeastern part of Ohio.


      3. **Determine the relative positions**: Wyoming is generally west of Ohio.
      Specifically, the Teton Range, being in northwestern Wyoming, is much further
      west than Lake Erie in northeastern Ohio.

      is located west of Lake Erie in Ohio, let''s consider the geographical locations
      of both places:


      1. **Teton Range, WY**: The Teton Range is located in the northwestern part
      of Wyoming. Wyoming is part of the western United States.


      2. **Lake Erie, OH**: Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes and is located in
      the northeastern part of the United States. Ohio is situated in the Midwest,
      to the east of Wyoming.


      Given these positions:


      - Wyoming is geographically west of Ohio.
