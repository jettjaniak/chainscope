    d7664ba9-ead0-4ffa-96da-f995bdbc1ff2: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Locate Ibiza:

      - Ibiza is an island in the Mediterranean Sea

      - It is part of the Balearic Islands, which belong to Spain

      - It is located in the western Mediterranean, specifically west of the Spanish
      mainland


      2. Locate the Emirate of Abu Dhabi:

      - Abu Dhabi is an emirate in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)

      - It is located in the southeastern part of the Arabian Peninsula

      - It is on the Persian Gulf coast of the Middle East


      3. Compare their geographical positions:

      - Ibiza is in the western Mediterranean

      - Abu Dhabi is in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula

      - These locations are quite far apart, on different continents


      4. Determine relative positioning:

      - Ibiza is west of Abu Dhabi

      - If you drew a line from Ibiza towards Abu Dhabi, you would be moving eastward


      Therefore, the answer is: YES, Ibiza is located west of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.'
