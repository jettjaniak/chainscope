      - Portland, Oregon is located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United
      States.

      \ west of Orlando, FL, I need to consider their relative positions on a map\
      \ of the United States.\n\nStep 1: Recall the general geography of the United\
      \ States.\n- California is on the west coast of the United States.\n- Florida\
      \ is on the southeastern part of the United States.\n\nStep 2: Consider their\
      \ specific locations.\n- San Diego is in southern California, on the Pacific\
      \ Ocean.\n- Orlando is in central Florida, closer to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\
      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.\n- Places that are \"west\" of\
      \ others have a higher longitude value (when using the standard negative values\
      \ for western hemisphere).\n- San Diego is approximately at longitude 117\xB0\
      \ W.\n- Orlando is approximately at longitude 81\xB0 W.\n\nStep 4: Make the\
