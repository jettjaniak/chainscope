      2. Seattle is located in the Pacific Northwest, in the state of Washington,
      which is on the west coast of the United States.


      3. Detroit is located in the Midwest, in the state of Michigan, which is closer
      to the eastern part of the United States.


      4. When looking at a map of the United States, Seattle is clearly positioned
      further west than Detroit.


      5. To confirm this, we can imagine drawing a vertical line representing longitude
      - Seattle would be to the west of this line, while Detroit would be to the east.


      Therefore, the answer is:


      YES, Seattle, WA is located west of Detroit, MI.'
