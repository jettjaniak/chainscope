      - Nashville is located in north-central Tennessee


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of Texas and Tennessee.

      - Texas is considerably west of Tennessee on the U.S. map

      - Tennessee is in the eastern half of the country, while Texas spans from the

      San Antonio is in Texas, which is in the southwestern part of the United States.
      Texas borders Mexico to its south and west, New Mexico to its west, Oklahoma
      to its north, etc.


      Nashville is in Tennessee, which is more in the eastern half of the United States.
      Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky to the north, Virginia to the northeast, North
      Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, Arkansas
      to the west, and Missouri to the northwest.


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), Texas is generally west of Tennessee.
      San Antonio is in the southern part of Texas, while Nashville is in the northern
      part of Tennessee.


      Given the general geography of the US, San Antonio should be west of Nashville.

      - San Antonio is in south-central Texas

      - Nashville is in north-central Tennessee


      Step 3: Think about longitude (east-west positioning).

      - Texas is significantly west of Tennessee on the US map

      - Even though San Antonio is in the eastern half of Texas, and Nashville is
      in the western half of Tennessee, the entire state of Texas is west of Tennessee


      Step 4: Therefore, San Antonio must be west of Nashville in terms of longitude.

      CA is located west of Brooklyn, NY, I need to consider the relative positions
      of these cities on a map of the United States.


      Step 1: Recall the general geography of the United States.

      - California (CA) is on the west coast of the United States

      - New York (NY) is on the east coast of the United States


      Step 2: More specifically, locate Beverly Hills and Brooklyn.

      - Beverly Hills is a city in Los Angeles County, California, on the western
      side of the country

      - Brooklyn is a borough of New York City, New York, on the eastern side of the
      country


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, Beverly
      Hills is definitely west of Brooklyn.


      So Beverly Hills, CA is located west of Brooklyn, NY.</think>I''ll think about
      this step by step:


      Step 1: Let me consider the geographic locations of both cities in the United
      States.

      - Beverly Hills is located in California (CA), which is on the west coast of
      the United States.

      - Brooklyn is located in New York (NY), which is on the east coast of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on a map.

      - The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic
      Ocean (east).

      - California is adjacent to the Pacific Ocean on the western edge of the country.

      - New York is near the Atlantic Ocean on the eastern portion of the country.


      Step 3: Determine their relative east-west positioning.

      - Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, any
      city in California (including Beverly Hills) would be west of any city in New
      York (including Brooklyn).


      YES, Beverly Hills, CA is located west of Brooklyn, NY.'

      in the Rocky Mountain region.

      3. Geographically, the west coast (California) is west of the Rocky Mountain
      region (Colorado).

      4. Therefore, Compton, CA (in California) would be west of Denver, CO (in Colorado).

      First, let me think about the locations of these cities in terms of U.S. geography:


      1. Compton is a city in California, which is on the west coast of the United
      States.

      2. Denver is the capital city of Colorado, which is in the western part of the
      United States, but it''s not on the coast - it''s in the Rocky Mountain region.


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning):

      - California is generally west of Colorado

      - Compton is in Los Angeles County, in southern California

      - Denver is in eastern Colorado


      Since California is west of Colorado, and Compton is in California while Denver
      is in Colorado, Compton would be west of Denver.

      California (including Compton) would be west of any city in Colorado (including
      Denver).</think># Is Compton, CA located west of Denver, CO?


      Let me think through this step by step:

      1. I need to identify the rough longitude of both cities

      2. Compare them to determine which is further west


      Compton, CA is in the Los Angeles area of Southern California, which is on the
      west coast of the United States.


      Denver, CO is in Colorado, which is in the interior western United States, but
      not on the west coast.


      The west coast of the US (California, Oregon, Washington) is the westernmost

      - Colorado is east of California, in the Rocky Mountain region.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudes.

      - All of California lies west of Colorado on a map.

      need to determine the relative east-west positions of Seattle, WA and Detroit,
      MI.


      Step 1: Identify the geographic locations of both cities.

      - Seattle is located in Washington state, on the west coast of the United States.

      - Detroit is located in Michigan, in the Great Lakes region in the eastern half
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Compare their locations on the east-west axis.

      - Washington state borders the Pacific Ocean and is one of the westernmost states
      in the continental US.

      - Michigan is much further east, closer to the Atlantic side of the country
      than the Pacific side.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      - If you were to travel from Seattle to Detroit, you would need to go eastward.

      - If you were to travel from Detroit to Seattle, you would need to go westward.

      Detroit is in Michigan, which is in the Midwest region of the United States,
      near the Great Lakes.

      The United States generally has locations further west as you go from the east
      coast toward the west coast. California (CA) is on the west coast of the US,
      while New York (NY) is on the east coast.

      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Louisiana is in the southeastern part of the United States, along the Gulf
      of Mexico


      Malibu is a city in California, located on the Pacific coast. Since it''s on
      the Pacific coast of California, it''s definitely in the western part of the
      United States.


      New Orleans is a city in Louisiana, located near the Gulf of Mexico in the southeastern
      United States.


      The United States spans from west to east, with the west coast (Pacific Ocean)
      being the westernmost part and the east coast (Atlantic Ocean) being the easternmost
      part. California is on the west coast, while Louisiana is much further east,
      closer to the east coast than the west coast.


      Therefore, Malibu, CA is located west of New Orleans, LA.</think>I''ll think

      5) Specifically, Malibu is positioned on the Pacific coastline of California,
      while New Orleans is positioned near the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana.


      6) The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the
      Atlantic Ocean (east), with California being one of the westernmost states and
      Louisiana being much closer to the eastern half of the country.

      Houston is in Texas, which is in the southern part of the United States. Texas
      is west of Florida, which is where Miami Beach is located.


      I can confirm this by thinking about the U.S. map. Texas is located in the southwestern
      part of the United States, bordering Mexico to its south. Florida is in the
      southeastern part of the United States, forming a peninsula that extends into
      the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.


      Going further, Houston is in the southeastern part of Texas, but Texas as a

      think through this step by step:


      Step 1: Let''s identify the locations of both cities on the US map.

      - Santa Monica is located in California, which is on the West Coast of the United
      States.

      - Philadelphia is located in Pennsylvania, which is on the East Coast of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider their positions in terms of longitude (east-west position).

      - California is considerably west of Pennsylvania on the US map.

      - Santa Monica specifically is on the Pacific coastline of California.

      - Philadelphia is in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, near the Atlantic coast.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      - The entire state of California is west of the entire state of Pennsylvania.

      - Therefore, Santa Monica must be west of Philadelphia.

      is located west of Philadelphia, PA, I need to think about the geographical
      locations of these two cities within the United States.


      Philadelphia, PA is located on the eastern coast of the United States, specifically
      in Pennsylvania which is an East Coast state.


      Santa Monica, CA is located in California, which is on the western coast of
      the United States.


      The United States generally spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west). East Coast states like Pennsylvania are on the Atlantic side,
      while West Coast states like California are on the Pacific side.


      Given that California is a West Coast state and Pennsylvania is an East Coast
      state, any city in California would be west of any city in Pennsylvania.


      Therefore, Santa Monica, CA is indeed located west of Philadelphia, PA.</think>I
      need to determine if Santa Monica, CA is west of Philadelphia, PA by examining
      their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify where Philadelphia, PA is located.

      Philadelphia is in Pennsylvania, which is on the eastern side of the United
      States along the Atlantic coast.


      Step 2: Identify where Santa Monica, CA is located.

      Santa Monica is in California, which is on the western side of the United States
      along the Pacific coast.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the east-west axis.

      The United States extends from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west). Since California is a West Coast state and Pennsylvania is an East Coast
      state, California is west of Pennsylvania.


      Step 4: Make the final determination about the specific cities.

      Since Santa Monica is in California and Philadelphia is in Pennsylvania, Santa
      Monica is west of Philadelphia.
