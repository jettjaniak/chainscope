      1) First, let me recall the approximate locations:

      - San Antonio is in south-central Texas

      - Nashville is in north-central Tennessee


      2) Let me think about their positions relative to each other:

      - Tennessee is in the eastern part of the US

      - Texas is in the southern and western part of the US

      - Texas is clearly west of Tennessee


      3) Looking at their specific locations within their states:

      - San Antonio''s position within Texas doesn''t change the fact that all of
      Texas is west of Tennessee

      - Nashville''s position within Tennessee doesn''t affect this relationship


      4) Therefore, since San Antonio is in Texas, and all of Texas is west of Tennessee
      (and thus Nashville), San Antonio must be west of Nashville.

      - Queens is in New York City, on the east coast of the United States

      - Yosemite Valley is in California, on the west coast of the United States


      2) Looking at US geography:

      - California is entirely west of New York

      - All points in California are west of all points in New York

      - Since Yosemite Valley is in California and Queens is in New York

      - Yosemite Valley must be west of Queens

      - Santa Monica is on the Pacific coast of California

      - Philadelphia is on the east coast, near the Atlantic Ocean


      2) When comparing east-west positions in the US:

      - The Pacific coast is the westernmost part of the continental US

      - The Atlantic coast is the easternmost part of the continental US
