      \ near the border with Washington state, and it's on the Pacific Ocean side\
      \ of the country.\n\nAustin, Texas is located in the south-central part of the\
      \ United States. Texas borders Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico to the south and\
      \ southeast.\n\nLooking at the United States from a west-to-east perspective:\n\
      - The West Coast (California, Oregon, Washington) is the westernmost part of\

      \ are east of the West Coast\n- The Central states (including Texas) are east\

      \ Portland, OR is definitely west of Austin, TX. \n\nI can also think about\
      \ this in terms of longitude. Western longitudes in the United States range\
      \ roughly from about 125\xB0 W on the West Coast to about 70\xB0 W on the East\
      \ Coast. The more western a location, the higher its longitude number (in the\

      \ (including Oregon) are the westernmost part of the contiguous United States.\n\
      Texas is situated in the middle/central portion of the country, east of the\
      \ western states.\n\nStep 3: Compare their approximate longitudes.\nPortland\
      \ is roughly at 122\xB0 W longitude.\nAustin is roughly at 97\xB0 W longitude.\n\
      Since both are in the Western Hemisphere, the higher the longitude number, the\

      Let me think about the geographical locations of these cities in the United
      States:


      1. Portland, Oregon is located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United
      States, on the west coast.

      2. Austin, Texas is located in the southern central part of the United States.


      In terms of longitude (east-west position):

      - Portland is on the west coast, near the Pacific Ocean

      - Austin is much farther east, closer to the central part of the country


      The western parts of the United States have lower longitude values than eastern
      parts. Portland, being on the west coast, would have a lower longitude (more
      westerly position) than Austin, which is in a more central/eastern location.

      Step 1: Recall the locations of both cities within the United States.

      - Portland, OR is located in the Pacific Northwest region, near the west coast.

      - Austin, TX is located in the south-central region of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions in terms of longitude (east-west position).

      - Portland is situated very close to the Pacific Ocean on the western edge of
      the continental US.

      - Austin is positioned much farther inland, in the central part of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Locations on the west coast have more westerly positions than locations in
      the central United States.

      - The west coast of the US is definitively west of all of Texas.

      \ the geographical relationship between Manhattan, NY and Boston, MA. Specifically,\
      \ it's asking if Manhattan is located west of Boston. Let me work through this\
      \ step by step.\n\nStep 1: Recall the general locations of these cities.\nManhattan\
      \ is a borough of New York City, which is located on the eastern seaboard of\
      \ the United States.\nBoston is a city in Massachusetts, also located on the\
      \ eastern seaboard of the United States.\n\nStep 2: Determine their relative\

      \ 74\xB0 W longitude.\nBoston, MA is located at approximately 71\xB0 W longitude.\n\
      \nStep 3: Compare their longitudes.\nWhen comparing longitudes in the northern\
      \ hemisphere, the location with the higher number of degrees West is further\
      \ west.\n\nManhattan: ~74\xB0 W\nBoston: ~71\xB0 W\n\nSince 74 > 71, Manhattan\
      \ is at a higher degree of western longitude than Boston.\n\nStep 4: Reach a\
      \ conclusion.\nBased on the comparison of longitudes, Manhattan is located further\
      \ west than Boston.\n\nSo the answer is YES, Manhattan, NY is located west of\
      \ Boston, MA.\n\nActually, let me double-check this. In the northern hemisphere,\
      \ locations with higher western longitude (W) numbers are indeed further west.\
      \ \n\nSo if Manhattan is at ~74\xB0 W and Boston is at ~71\xB0 W, then Manhattan\
      \ is further west (because 74\xB0 W is a higher number than 71\xB0 W, meaning\

      \ is located at approximately 74\xB0 West longitude.\nBoston is located at approximately\
      \ 71\xB0 West longitude.\n\nStep 3: Compare these coordinates.\nOn longitude\
      \ measurements, higher \"West\" numbers indicate positions further west.\nSince\
      \ 74\xB0W > 71\xB0W, Manhattan is further west than Boston.\n\nStep 4: Visualize\
      \ on a map.\nIf you look at a map of the northeastern United States, you'll\
      \ see that New York City (including Manhattan) is indeed west of Boston.\n\n\
      YES, Manhattan, NY is located west of Boston, MA."

      \nTo determine if Manhattan is west of Boston, I need to compare their longitudes.\
      \ Places that are more west have a higher longitude value.\n\nActually, that's\
      \ incorrect. Places that are more west have a LOWER longitude value in the western\
      \ hemisphere. In the northern hemisphere of Earth, longitude is measured in\
      \ degrees west of the Prime Meridian (0\xB0), so a higher value means farther\
      \ west.\n\nWait, I made a mistake again. Let me be very precise: In the standard\
      \ geographic coordinate system, longitude is measured in degrees east (positive\
      \ values) or west (negative values) of the Prime Meridian. In the western hemisphere\
      \ (which includes the United States), longitudes are negative numbers. So a\
      \ place that is farther west will have a more negative longitude (or a numerically\
      \ lower value).\n\nThe approximate coordinates are:\n- Manhattan, NY: around\

      \nStep 2: Compare the longitude values (the east-west component).\n- Manhattan:\
      \ 74.0\xB0W\n- Boston: 71.1\xB0W\n\nStep 3: Interpret these values. In the Western\
      \ Hemisphere, a higher western longitude number (74.0 vs 71.1) means a location\
      \ is further west.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on the longitude comparison.\n\

      the United States.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States


      Step 2: More specifically, let''s recall where Beverly Hills and Brooklyn are
      within their respective states.

      - Beverly Hills is a city in Los Angeles County, California, which is in the
      southern part of California on the west coast

      - Brooklyn is a borough of New York City, which is in the southeastern part
      of New York state on the east coast


      Step 3: Think about the relative positions of these locations on a map of the
      United States.

      When looking at a map of the United States, California is to the west of New
      York. Since Beverly Hills is in California and Brooklyn is in New York, Beverly
      Hills must be west of Brooklyn.


      So, the answer is YES, Beverly Hills, CA is located west of Brooklyn, NY.</think>I
      need to determine if Beverly Hills, California is west of Brooklyn, New York.


      Step 1: Consider the locations of California and New York states.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States.

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify where Beverly Hills and Brooklyn are within these states.

      - Beverly Hills is a city in Los Angeles County in southern California.

      - Brooklyn is a borough of New York City in the state of New York.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Since California is approximately 3,000 miles west of New York, any city in
      California (including Beverly Hills) would be west of any location in New York
      (including Brooklyn).


      YES, Beverly Hills, CA is located west of Brooklyn, NY.'

      Brooklyn is a borough of New York City, which is on the east coast of the United
      States along the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the east-west axis.

      The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west). California is on the Pacific side, while New York is on the Atlantic
      side.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on their relative positions.

      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, Beverly
      Hills must be west of Brooklyn.

      - Denver is the capital city of Colorado.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of California and Colorado.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States.

      - Colorado is an inland state in the Mountain West region of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - California is entirely west of Colorado on a map of the United States.

      CA is located west of Denver, CO.


      First, let''s identify where these cities are:

      - Compton, CA is in California, specifically in the Los Angeles metropolitan
      area in southern California.

      - Denver, CO is in Colorado, which is in the interior of the United States,
      in the Rocky Mountain region.


      In the United States, locations are generally considered "west" if they have
      a more westerly longitude. The continental United States generally spans from
      the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean (east).


      California is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific
      Ocean. Colorado is inland, to the east of California.


      Since California is on the west coast and Colorado is further inland (east of
      California), Compton (being in California) must be west of Denver (which is
      in Colorado).


      Let me double-check this reasoning:

      - California is west of Colorado on a map of the United States

      - Compton is in California

      - Denver is in Colorado

      - Therefore, Compton is west of Denver


      So yes, Compton, CA is located west of Denver, CO.</think>I need to determine

      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      California is on the west coast of the United States, while Colorado is several

      2. Detroit is located in Michigan, which is in the Midwest region of the United
      States.

      3. The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific

      coast of the United States.

      2. Queens is a borough of New York City, which is in New York (NY) state, located
      on the east coast of the United States.

      3. In terms of geography in the United States, California is west of New York.


      To be more specific:

      - California is on the Pacific coast, which forms the western border of the
      contiguous United States.

      - New York is on the Atlantic coast, which forms the eastern border of the contiguous
      United States.

      - States on the west coast (like California) are west of states on the east
      coast (like New York).


      Therefore, Yosemite Valley, CA is located west of Queens, NY.


      The answer is YES.</think>To determine whether Yosemite Valley, CA is located
      west of Queens, NY, I need to think about their geographic locations within

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Yosemite Valley is located in California (CA)

      - Queens is a borough of New York City in New York (NY)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positioning of these states.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific
      Ocean

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the map.

      Ocean (east)

      - California is one of the westernmost states

      - New York is one of the easternmost states


      Step 4: Make the logical conclusion.

      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, any
      location in California (including Yosemite Valley) is west of any location in
      New York (including Queens).


      YES, Yosemite Valley, CA is located west of Queens, NY.'

      along the Pacific Ocean.

      - Miami is located in Florida on the east coast of the United States, along
      the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 2: Understand how east and west work on US maps.

      - On standard US maps, the west coast is on the left side and the east coast
      is on the right side.

      - Going from east to west means moving from right to left on the map.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - California is on the far western side of the continental United States.

      - Florida is on the far eastern side of the continental United States.

      - Therefore, San Francisco (in California) is west of Miami (in Florida).

      1) Santa Monica is located in California, which is on the west coast of the
      United States.

      2) Philadelphia is located in Pennsylvania, which is on the east coast of the

      relative positions of two US cities: Santa Monica, California and Philadelphia,
      Pennsylvania. Specifically, it''s asking whether Santa Monica is located west
      of Philadelphia.


      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific
      Ocean on the west.

      - California (CA) is a state on the west coast of the United States, bordering
      the Pacific Ocean.

      - Pennsylvania (PA) is a state in the northeastern part of the United States,
      much closer to the Atlantic Ocean than to the Pacific Ocean.


      Given these facts, California is clearly west of Pennsylvania on a map of the
      United States.


      Now, specifically for the cities:

      - Santa Monica is a city in western Los Angeles County, California, right on
      the Pacific Ocean.

      - Philadelphia is a major city in southeastern Pennsylvania, close to the Atlantic
      Ocean.


      Since Santa Monica is in California (a western state) and Philadelphia is in
      Pennsylvania (an eastern state), it follows that Santa Monica is located west
      of Philadelphia.


      So the answer is YES, Santa Monica, CA is located west of Philadelphia, PA.</think>I
      need to determine if Santa Monica, CA is located west of Philadelphia, PA.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic layout of the United States. The US spans from
      the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean (west).


      Step 2: Identify the locations of both cities in this context.

      - Philadelphia, PA is located in the eastern part of the US, near the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      - Santa Monica, CA is located in the western part of the US, on the Pacific
      Coast.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions. Since California is on the west coast
      and Pennsylvania is much further east, any city in California (including Santa
      Monica) would be west of any city in Pennsylvania (including Philadelphia).


      YES, Santa Monica, CA is located west of Philadelphia, PA.'

      Step 1: I''ll consider the geographical locations of both cities in terms of
      their positions within the United States.


      Santa Monica, CA is in California, which is on the west coast of the United
      States.

      Philadelphia, PA is in Pennsylvania, which is on the east coast of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Let me think about their relative positions in terms of longitude (east-west
      positioning).


      The west coast of the US is geographically west of the east coast of the US.
      States on the west coast (like California) have longitudes further west than
      states on the east coast (like Pennsylvania).


      Step 3: Since Santa Monica is in California (west coast) and Philadelphia is
      in Pennsylvania (east coast), Santa Monica must be west of Philadelphia.


      So the answer is YES, Santa Monica, CA is located west of Philadelphia, PA.</think>I''ll

      United States.

      - Philadelphia, PA is located in Pennsylvania, which is on the east coast of
      the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions in terms of longitude (east-west positioning).

      - The west coast of the US (where California is) is situated to the west of
      the east coast (where Pennsylvania is).

      - Cities in California will have longitudes further west than cities in Pennsylvania.


      Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on the positions.

      - Since Santa Monica is in California on the west coast and Philadelphia is
      in Pennsylvania on the east coast, Santa Monica must be west of Philadelphia.

      To solve this, I need to think about the geographic locations of these two cities
      within the United States.


      1. San Diego is located on the west coast of the United States, in Southern
      California. It''s on the Pacific Ocean.

      2. Orlando is located in central Florida, which is in the southeastern part
      of the United States, not on the west coast.


      Looking at a mental map of the United States:

      - California is on the far western edge of the continental US

      - Florida is on the southeastern portion of the US


      In terms of longitude (east-west position):

      - San Diego, CA is much further west than Orlando, FL

      - California is the westernmost state in the contiguous United States

    d90cb98a-6e52-493e-bca2-ca724c4a6681: '<think>I need to determine whether San
      Diego, CA is located west of Orlando, FL. Let me think about the locations of
      these cities within the United States.


      San Diego is located in California, which is on the west coast of the United
      States. Specifically, San Diego is in the southwestern corner of California,
      bordering the Pacific Ocean.


      Orlando is located in Florida, which is in the southeastern part of the United
      States. Florida is on the east coast, with the Atlantic Ocean on its eastern
      side and the Gulf of Mexico on its western side.


      In terms of geography in the United States, when we say "west of," we''re talking
      about the longitude coordinates. Places further west have lower longitude values
      (going all the way to the Pacific coast), while places further east have higher
      longitude values (going to the Atlantic coast).


      Since San Diego is on the west coast and Orlando is on the east coast, San Diego
      is definitely west of Orlando. The entire state of California is west of the
      entire state of Florida.


      So my answer is YES, San Diego is located west of Orlando.</think>To answer
      this question, I need to consider the geographic locations of both cities on
      a map of the United States.


      Step 1: Recall the general locations of both cities.

      - San Diego is located in California, which is on the west coast of the United
      States.

      - Orlando is located in Florida, which is on the southeast part of the United
      States.


      Step 2: Consider their positions in terms of longitude (east-west positioning).

      - California is on the Pacific Ocean side of the continental United States.

      - Florida is on the Atlantic Ocean side of the continental United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - The entire state of California is west of the entire state of Florida.

      - Therefore, San Diego must be west of Orlando.


      YES, San Diego, CA is located west of Orlando, FL.'

      San Diego is located in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the United
      States. It''s located in the southwestern corner of California, right along
      the Pacific Ocean.


      Orlando is located in Florida (FL), which is in the southeastern part of the
      United States. Florida is on the east coast, bordering the Atlantic Ocean and
      the Gulf of Mexico. Orlando specifically is in central Florida.


      The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west coast) to the
      Atlantic Ocean (east coast). California is on the west coast, and Florida is
      on the east coast.


      So in terms of east-west orientation, California is west of Florida, which means
      San Diego (in California) is west of Orlando (in Florida).


      Therefore, the answer is YES, San Diego, CA is located west of Orlando, FL.</think>To

      - California borders the Pacific Ocean on the west coast.

      - Florida is in the southeastern portion of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - California is entirely west of Florida on a map.

      - San Diego is in the southwestern part of California.

      - Orlando is in the central part of Florida.


      YES, San Diego, CA is located west of Orlando, FL.'
