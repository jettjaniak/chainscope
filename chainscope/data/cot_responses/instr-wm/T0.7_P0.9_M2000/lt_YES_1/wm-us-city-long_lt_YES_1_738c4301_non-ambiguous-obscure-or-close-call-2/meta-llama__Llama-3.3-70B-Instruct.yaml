      I will break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the general geographical location of both cities**: Portland,
      OR (Oregon) is in the Pacific Northwest, which is in the northern part of the
      western United States. Austin, TX (Texas) is located in the south-central part
      of the United States.


      2. **Consider the longitudinal positions**: Generally, as you move west in the
      United States, the longitude increases (with the exception of Alaska and Hawaii,
      which are not relevant to this comparison). Portland, OR, being on the west
      coast, has a higher longitude than Austin, TX, which is more towards the central
      part of the country.


      3. **Account for latitudinal differences**: While latitude (north-south position)
      does not directly answer the east-west question, it''s worth noting that Portland
      is significantly north of Austin. However, the primary concern is their east-west
      relationship.


      4. **Conclusion based on geographical knowledge**: Given that Portland is on
      the west coast and Austin is centrally located but more to the east compared
      to Portland, it can be inferred that Portland is indeed west of Austin.


      Given these steps, the answer is: **YES**'

    f0a4590f-2029-4582-aa7a-0c17602cda55: 'To answer this question,
      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Portland, OR (Oregon) is a city located in the
      Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Austin, TX (Texas) is a city
      located in the south-central part of the United States.


      2. **Determine the general geography**: The United States is generally divided
      into regions, with the west coast being the area along the Pacific Ocean. Oregon
      is considered part of the west coast, whereas Texas is considered part of the
      southwest or south-central United States.


      3. **Consider longitude**: Longitude measures how far east or west a place is.
      The farther west a location is, the higher its longitude number (up to 180 degrees,
      then it goes back to -180 degrees moving eastward). Generally, without needing
      exact numbers, we can reason that the west coast (where Portland, OR is located)
      is west of the central and southern parts of the U.S. (where Austin, TX is located).


      4. **Apply the information to the cities**: Given that Portland, OR is on the
      west coast and Austin, TX is more centrally located (though in the southern
      part of the central U.S.), we can deduce that Portland is indeed west of Austin.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Portland, OR is located west of
      Austin, TX is: **YES**.'

      2. **Consider their general geographic locations**: New York City (including
      Manhattan) is generally known to be southwest of Boston, Massachusetts, given
      the layout of the northeastern United States.

      3. **Determine the directional relationship**: To be west of something means
      that the location in question must be to the left (or on the left side) when
      facing north. Given that Manhattan is southwest of Boston, this means Manhattan
      is indeed to the southwest, which includes a westerly component but is not directly
      west.

      4. **Conclusion**: Considering the exact directional relationship, Manhattan
      is not directly west of Boston but rather southwest. However, the question asks
      if Manhattan is located west of Boston, which simplifies to determining if there''s
      any part of Manhattan that is west of Boston. Given the geography, Manhattan
      is indeed southwest, which means part of it could be considered west in a broad
