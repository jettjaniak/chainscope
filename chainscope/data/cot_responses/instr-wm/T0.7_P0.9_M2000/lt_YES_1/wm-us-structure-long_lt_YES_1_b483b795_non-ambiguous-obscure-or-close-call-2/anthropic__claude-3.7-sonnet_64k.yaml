    1a73c96a-8556-4d5c-92ee-63caa11c3a71: "<think>Let me break this down step by step:\n\
      \n1. I need to determine the locations of two places:\n   - The Hollywood Sign\
      \ in California (CA)\n   - The George Bush Center for Intelligence in Maryland\
      \ (MD)\n\n2. Then I need to determine whether the Hollywood Sign is west of\
      \ the George Bush Center for Intelligence.\n\nLet's start with the locations:\n\
      \nThe Hollywood Sign is a famous landmark located in Los Angeles, California,\
      \ which is on the west coast of the United States.\n\nThe George Bush Center\
      \ for Intelligence is the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)\
      \ located in Langley, Virginia (not Maryland as stated in the question - this\
      \ appears to be an error). Langley is near Washington, D.C., on the east coast\
      \ of the United States.\n\nEven if we assume the question meant to refer to\
      \ a facility in Maryland, Maryland is still on the east coast of the United\
      \ States.\n\nNow for the directional comparison:\n\nIn the United States, California\
      \ is on the west coast, while Maryland (and Virginia) are on the east coast.\
      \ The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic\
      \ Ocean (east).\n\nTherefore, California is west of Maryland (and Virginia).\n\
      \nSince the Hollywood Sign is in California, and the George Bush Center for\
      \ Intelligence is either in Virginia or Maryland (both on the east coast), the\
      \ Hollywood Sign is west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence.\n\nActually,\
      \ I should be precise. The George Bush Center for Intelligence is the headquarters\
      \ of the CIA, and it's located in Langley, Virginia, not Maryland. Let me double-check\
      \ this.\n\nYes, the CIA headquarters is officially called the George Bush Center\
      \ for Intelligence (named after George H.W. Bush), and it's located in Langley,\
      \ Virginia, which is near Washington, D.C. \n\nThere might be confusion in the\
      \ question, as Maryland is adjacent to Virginia, and both are on the east coast\
      \ of the United States. But regardless of whether the facility is in Virginia\
      \ or Maryland, the conclusion remains the same: the Hollywood Sign in California\
      \ is west of the east coast states.\n\nSo, to directly answer the question:\
      \ Yes, the Hollywood Sign in CA is located west of the George Bush Center for\
      \ Intelligence, regardless of whether the latter is in Virginia (which is correct)\
      \ or Maryland (as stated in the question).\n\nActually, I should be careful.\
      \ The question specifically mentions the George Bush Center for Intelligence\
      \ in MD (Maryland). I need to check if there is a branch of the CIA or another\
      \ intelligence center named after George Bush in Maryland, distinct from the\
      \ main CIA headquarters in Virginia.\n\nAfter considering this further, I believe\
      \ the question contains an error in identifying the location of the George Bush\
      \ Center for Intelligence. The CIA headquarters named after George H.W. Bush\
      \ is in Langley, Virginia, not Maryland. However, even if there were a similarly\
      \ named facility in Maryland, the geographical relationship would remain the\
      \ same: California (and thus the Hollywood Sign) is west of both Virginia and\
      \ Maryland.\n\nTo be absolutely clear: California is on the west coast of the\
      \ United States, while both Maryland and Virginia are on the east coast. Therefore,\
      \ any location in California, including the Hollywood Sign, is west of any location\
      \ in Maryland or Virginia, including the George Bush Center for Intelligence.\n\
      \nSo my answer remains: Yes, the Hollywood Sign in CA is located west of the\
      \ George Bush Center for Intelligence, MD (or VA).\n\nActually, let me be even\
      \ more careful and precise. I want to make sure I'm not missing anything about\
      \ a potential intelligence facility named after George Bush in Maryland.\n\n\
      The CIA headquarters, officially named the George Bush Center for Intelligence\
      \ (after President George H.W. Bush), is located in Langley, Virginia. I am\
      \ not aware of a similarly named intelligence center in Maryland.\n\nHowever,\
      \ the National Security Agency (NSA) headquarters is located at Fort Meade,\
      \ Maryland. But this is not called the \"George Bush Center for Intelligence.\"\
      \n\nI believe the question might have mistakenly placed the George Bush Center\
      \ for Intelligence in Maryland instead of Virginia. But for the purposes of\
      \ answering the directional question, it doesn't change the outcome:\n\nThe\
      \ Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles, California is on the west coast of the U.S.\n\
      Virginia and Maryland are both on the east coast of the U.S.\nTherefore, the\
      \ Hollywood Sign is west of both states and any locations within them.\n\nSo\
      \ my final answer is: Yes, the Hollywood Sign in CA is located west of the George\
      \ Bush Center for Intelligence, regardless of whether it's in VA (correct) or\
      \ MD (as stated in the question).\n\nActually, now that I think about it, let\
      \ me double-check the location of the CIA headquarters again. \n\nThe CIA headquarters,\
      \ named the George Bush Center for Intelligence, is indeed located at Langley,\
      \ Virginia, not Maryland. The two states are adjacent, both on the east coast\
      \ of the United States, but they are distinct.\n\nSo the question contains an\
      \ inaccuracy in placing the George Bush Center for Intelligence in Maryland.\
      \ However, the geographical relationship still holds: California (west coast)\
      \ is west of both Virginia and Maryland (east coast).\n\nTherefore, the Hollywood\
      \ Sign in California is west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence in Virginia\
      \ (not Maryland).\n\nWait, I see I'm getting confused. Let me take a step back\
      \ and address precisely what the question is asking.\n\nThe question asks:\n\
      \"Is Hollywood Sign, CA located west of George Bush Center for Intelligence,\
      \ MD?\"\n\nThe question states that the George Bush Center for Intelligence\
      \ is in MD (Maryland). As I've noted, I believe this is incorrect - the George\
      \ Bush Center for Intelligence (CIA headquarters) is in Langley, Virginia, not\
      \ Maryland.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of answering the question, I'll assume\
      \ the premise that there is a \"George Bush Center for Intelligence\" in Maryland,\
      \ or that the question meant to refer to the CIA headquarters but mistakenly\
      \ placed it in Maryland.\n\nGiven that assumption, the answer is:\nYES, the\
      \ Hollywood Sign in California is located west of Maryland (and anything in\
      \ Maryland), because California is on the west coast of the United States, and\
      \ Maryland is on the east coast.\n\nLet me look at a map of the USA to confirm\
      \ this. \n\nThe United States is oriented with the Pacific Ocean to the west\
      \ and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. California borders the Pacific Ocean on\
      \ the west coast. Maryland is on the east coast, bordering the Atlantic Ocean.\
      \ Therefore, California (including the Hollywood Sign) is west of Maryland (including\
      \ any intelligence center located there).\n\nSo again, my answer is YES, the\
      \ Hollywood Sign in CA is located west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence\
      \ in MD (assuming such a center exists in Maryland, or that the question meant\
      \ to refer to the actual CIA headquarters in Virginia).\n\nActually, let me\
      \ be super precise here. I'll rely on the geographical fact that California\
      \ is west of Maryland in the United States. This is unambiguously true. \n\n\
      The Hollywood Sign is in Los Angeles, California.\nThe question states that\
      \ the George Bush Center for Intelligence is in Maryland.\n\nTherefore, the\
      \ Hollywood Sign in California is west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence\
      \ in Maryland.\n\nSo my final answer is: YES</think># Reasoning Step by Step\n\
      \nTo determine whether the Hollywood Sign in California is west of the George\
      \ Bush Center for Intelligence in Maryland, I need to examine the geographical\
      \ locations of both places.\n\n1) First, let's identify the locations:\n   -\
      \ The Hollywood Sign is located in Los Angeles, California\n   - The George\
      \ Bush Center for Intelligence is the CIA headquarters located in Maryland (according\
      \ to the question)\n\n2) Now, let's determine their relative positions:\n  \
      \ - California is on the west coast of the United States\n   - Maryland is on\
      \ the east coast of the United States\n\n3) Looking at a map of the United States:\n\
      \   - Going from east to west across the continental US, you'd start at the\
      \ Atlantic coast (where Maryland is), cross the country, and reach the Pacific\
      \ coast (where California is)\n   - Therefore, California is west of Maryland\n\
      \n4) Since the Hollywood Sign is in California and the George Bush Center for\
      \ Intelligence is in Maryland, the Hollywood Sign must be west of the George\
      \ Bush Center for Intelligence.\n\n# Answer: YES"

      step.


      1. First, I need to identify the locations of both the Hollywood Sign and the
      George Bush Center for Intelligence.


      The Hollywood Sign is located in Los Angeles, California (CA). California is
      on the west coast of the United States.


      The George Bush Center for Intelligence is the headquarters of the Central Intelligence
      Agency (CIA), which is located in Langley, Virginia, which is part of the Washington
      D.C. metropolitan area. However, the question states it''s in MD, which would
      be Maryland. Maryland is on the east coast of the United States, near Virginia
      and Washington D.C.


      2. Now I need to determine which is further west.


      The United States spans from the Pacific Ocean on the west to the Atlantic Ocean
      on the east. California, being on the west coast, is generally west of Maryland,
      which is on the east coast.


      So, the Hollywood Sign in California is west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence
      in Maryland.


      Wait, I should double-check. The George Bush Center for Intelligence (CIA Headquarters)
      is actually in Langley, Virginia (VA), not Maryland (MD) as stated in the question.
      Virginia is also on the east coast, though slightly west of Maryland. Regardless,
      California is still significantly west of Virginia.


      But I''ll go with the premise of the question which places the George Bush Center
      for Intelligence in Maryland.


      3. To confirm, let''s think about the general geographic layout of the United
      States. The west coast states (including California) are to the west of the
      east coast states (including Maryland). So anything in California is west of
      anything in Maryland.


      Therefore, the Hollywood Sign (in California) is located west of the George
      Bush Center for Intelligence (assumed to be in Maryland based on the question).


      The answer is YES, the Hollywood Sign in CA is located west of the George Bush
      Center for Intelligence in MD.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      Let me determine if the Hollywood Sign in California is west of the George Bush
      Center for Intelligence in Maryland.


      Step 1: Identify the locations

      - The Hollywood Sign is in Los Angeles, California (CA)

      - The George Bush Center for Intelligence (CIA headquarters) is in Maryland
      (MD) according to the question


      Step 2: Determine their geographical positions within the United States

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - Maryland is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions

      - When looking at a map of the United States, states on the west coast (like
      California) are always west of states on the east coast (like Maryland)

      - The entire state of California lies west of the entire state of Maryland


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion

      - Since the Hollywood Sign is in California (west coast) and the George Bush
      Center for Intelligence is in Maryland (east coast), the Hollywood Sign must
      be west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence


      YES'

    7394f166-e4ea-424b-abdb-51d24eb882a1: "<think>This question is asking me to compare\
      \ the geographic locations of two places in the United States:\n1. The Hollywood\

      \ west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence.\n\nFirst, let me recall the\
      \ general geographic layout of the United States:\n- The West Coast of the US\
      \ (California, Oregon, Washington) is on the western edge of the continental\
      \ United States.\n- The East Coast (including Maryland, Virginia, etc.) is on\

      \ look at the specific locations:\n1. The Hollywood Sign is located in Los Angeles,\
      \ California, which is on the West Coast of the United States.\n2. The George\
      \ Bush Center for Intelligence (which is the headquarters of the CIA) is located\
      \ in Langley, Virginia (not Maryland as stated in the question). It's near Washington\
      \ D.C., which is on the East Coast of the United States.\n\nWait, I need to\
      \ correct myself. The question refers to the George Bush Center for Intelligence\
      \ as being in Maryland (MD). The CIA headquarters at Langley is actually in\
      \ Virginia (VA), not Maryland. Let me double-check this...\n\nThe CIA headquarters,\
      \ also known as the George Bush Center for Intelligence (named after George\
      \ H.W. Bush), is indeed located in Langley, Virginia, not Maryland. The question\
      \ contains an error about the location.\n\nBut regardless of whether it's in\
      \ Virginia or Maryland, both states are on the East Coast of the United States,\
      \ and California is on the West Coast.\n\nSince the United States spans from\
      \ the Pacific Ocean on the west to the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and California\
      \ is on the western side while Virginia/Maryland are on the eastern side, the\
      \ Hollywood Sign in California is indeed west of the George Bush Center for\

      \ located west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence (although it's in\
      \ VA, not MD as stated in the question).\n\nActually, let me double check whether\
      \ the CIA headquarters (George Bush Center for Intelligence) might have a component\
      \ in Maryland that I'm not aware of. I'm pretty confident that the main CIA\
      \ headquarters is in Langley, Virginia, but let me verify that there isn't another\
      \ facility with that name in Maryland.\n\nAs far as I know, there is no \"George\

      \ name is in Langley, Virginia. So the question appears to have an error in\
      \ the state designation.\n\nHowever, even if there were such a center in Maryland,\
      \ Maryland is still on the East Coast of the United States, and California is\
      \ on the West Coast. So the Hollywood Sign in California would still be west\
      \ of any location in Maryland.\n\nSo my answer remains YES, the Hollywood Sign\
      \ in CA is located west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence, regardless\
      \ of whether the latter is in Virginia (where it actually is) or Maryland (as\
      \ stated in the question).\n\nLet me refine my thinking to make sure I have\
      \ this right.\n\nWhen we talk about east and west in the US, we're referring\
      \ to longitude. Western locations have smaller longitudes than eastern locations\
      \ (since longitude increases as you move eastward from the Prime Meridian).\n\
      \nThe Hollywood Sign is in Los Angeles, California, which is approximately at\
      \ longitude 118\xB0 W.\nThe CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia (regardless\
      \ of the state error in the question) is approximately at longitude 77\xB0 W.\n\
      \nSince 118\xB0 W is further west than 77\xB0 W (118 > 77 in terms of the numerical\
      \ value, but we're talking about degrees west of the Prime Meridian, so a larger\
      \ number means further west), the Hollywood Sign is indeed west of the George\
      \ Bush Center for Intelligence.\n\nActually, I need to be careful here. When\
      \ talking about degrees west of the Prime Meridian, a larger number means further\
      \ west. So 118\xB0 W is further west than 77\xB0 W.\n\nSo yes, the Hollywood\

      \ this, I need to:\n   a. Identify the locations of both places\n   b. Compare\
      \ their east-west positions\n\nStep 1: Identify the locations\n- The Hollywood\

      \ States.\n- The George Bush Center for Intelligence is the headquarters of\
      \ the CIA, located in Langley, Virginia (not Maryland as mentioned in the question).\
      \ Let me verify this - the CIA headquarters is officially in Langley, Virginia,\

      \ an incorrect state abbreviation. However, I'll proceed with the reasoning\
      \ based on their actual locations.\n\nStep 2: Compare their east-west positions\n\
      - The United States spans from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Atlantic\
      \ Ocean in the east.\n- California is on the west coast of the US.\n- Virginia\
      \ (where the CIA headquarters actually is) is on the east coast of the US.\n\
      \nTherefore, California is west of Virginia. Since the Hollywood Sign is in\
      \ California and the George Bush Center for Intelligence is in Virginia (not\
      \ Maryland), the Hollywood Sign is indeed west of the George Bush Center for\
      \ Intelligence.\n\nActually, let me double-check whether the George Bush Center\
      \ for Intelligence might actually be in Maryland rather than Virginia. The CIA\
      \ headquarters, which is officially called the George Bush Center for Intelligence\
      \ (named after former CIA Director and President George H.W. Bush), is located\
      \ in Langley, Virginia, which is part of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.\
      \ It is not in Maryland. So the question contains an error in the state location.\n\
      \nBut regardless of whether the George Bush Center for Intelligence is in Virginia\
      \ (which it actually is) or Maryland (as stated in the question), both Virginia\
      \ and Maryland are on the east coast of the United States, while California\
      \ is on the west coast. So the Hollywood Sign in California would be west of\
      \ the George Bush Center for Intelligence regardless of whether it's in Virginia\
      \ or Maryland.\n\nSo the answer is YES, the Hollywood Sign in California is\
      \ located west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence.\n\nBut wait, let\
      \ me think about this more carefully. The United States is on a sphere (the\
      \ Earth), so technically if you go far enough west from California, you'd eventually\
      \ reach the east coast again. But conventionally, when we talk about east-west\
      \ positions in the US, we're referring to the shortest path, which would place\
      \ California west of both Maryland and Virginia.\n\nLet me just double-check\
      \ once more: is the George Bush Center for Intelligence actually in Maryland?\
      \ I'm pretty sure it's in Virginia.\n\nThe CIA headquarters, officially named\
      \ the George Bush Center for Intelligence since 1999, is located in Langley,\
      \ Virginia, not Maryland. It's just across the Potomac River from Washington,\
      \ D.C. and not far from Maryland, but it is definitely in Virginia.\n\nHowever,\
      \ even if we assume that there is some facility called the George Bush Center\
      \ for Intelligence in Maryland (which I don't believe exists), the logic still\
      \ holds: California is on the west coast of the US, and Maryland is on the east\
      \ coast. So the Hollywood Sign would still be west of any location in Maryland.\n\
      \nSo, the answer is YES, the Hollywood Sign in California is located west of\
      \ the George Bush Center for Intelligence (which is actually in Virginia, not\
      \ Maryland as stated in the question).\n\nActually, I've been assuming that\
      \ the George Bush Center for Intelligence is the CIA headquarters. Let me confirm\
      \ this.\n\nYes, the George Bush Center for Intelligence is indeed the name of\
      \ the CIA headquarters complex in Langley, Virginia. It was renamed in 1999\
      \ to honor former President George H.W. Bush, who served as the Director of\
      \ Central Intelligence from 1976 to 1977.\n\nTo summarize:\n1. The Hollywood\
      \ Sign is in Los Angeles, California (west coast of the US).\n2. The George\
      \ Bush Center for Intelligence (CIA headquarters) is in Langley, Virginia (east\
      \ coast of the US), not Maryland as stated in the question.\n3. California is\
      \ west of Virginia (and would also be west of Maryland).\n\nTherefore, the Hollywood\
      \ Sign is indeed west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence.\n\nActually,\
      \ I should check whether there's a George Bush Center for Intelligence in Maryland,\

      George Bush Center for Intelligence\" located in Maryland. The CIA headquarters\
      \ in Langley, Virginia, is the facility officially named the George Bush Center\

      \ in Maryland.\n\nThere are certainly other intelligence agencies with facilities\
      \ in Maryland, such as the National Security Agency (NSA) at Fort Meade, but\
      \ none that I know of called the George Bush Center for Intelligence.\n\nSo,\
      \ assuming the question is referring to the actual George Bush Center for Intelligence\
      \ (CIA headquarters) but incorrectly placing it in Maryland instead of Virginia,\
      \ the answer would still be YES \u2013 the Hollywood Sign in California is west\

      \ or other intelligence facility named after George Bush in Maryland.\n\nI'm\
      \ not aware of any intelligence facility named after George Bush in Maryland.\
      \ The main CIA headquarters, the George Bush Center for Intelligence, is definitely\
      \ in Langley, Virginia. The NSA is headquartered at Fort Meade, Maryland, but\
      \ it's not named after Bush.\n\nSo, it seems the question contains an error\
      \ in the location of the George Bush Center for Intelligence, placing it in\
      \ Maryland when it's actually in Virginia. But regardless, the answer to the\
      \ question \"Is the Hollywood Sign, CA located west of the George Bush Center\
      \ for Intelligence, MD?\" is YES, because California is west of both Virginia\
      \ and Maryland.\n\nFor clarity, here's a final summary:\n1. The Hollywood Sign\

      because Texas is geographically west of Massachusetts in the United States.


      Therefore, Mount Carmel Center in Texas would be west of Fenway Park in Massachusetts.


      So my answer is YES, Mount Carmel Center, TX is located west of Fenway Park,
      MA.</think>To determine if Mount Carmel Center, TX is west of Fenway Park, MA,
      I need to consider the geographic locations of Texas and Massachusetts.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Fenway Park is located in Boston, Massachusetts

      - Mount Carmel Center was located near Waco, Texas


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions.

      - Massachusetts is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Texas is located in the south-central region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their longitude.

      - States in the central region of the US (like Texas) are west of states on
      the east coast (like Massachusetts)

      - All locations in Texas are west of all locations in Massachusetts


      Therefore, YES, Mount Carmel Center, TX is located west of Fenway Park, MA.'

      Let me break this down:


      1. Mount Carmel Center is in Texas (TX)

      2. Fenway Park is in Massachusetts (MA)

      3. I need to determine if Mount Carmel Center is west of Fenway Park


      To answer this, I need to think about the geographical positions of Texas and
      Massachusetts in the United States.


      The United States has the following rough geographical layout:

      - The West Coast includes states like California, Oregon, and Washington

      - The Midwest includes states like Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio

      - The South includes states like Texas, Louisiana, and Florida

      - The Northeast includes states like Massachusetts, New York, and Maine


      Texas is located in the southern part of the United States, extending fairly
      far west (though not to the west coast).

      Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States.


      On a west-to-east basis:

      - Western states include California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, etc.

      - Central states include Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, etc.

      - Eastern states include Massachusetts, New York, Maine, etc.


      Texas is definitely west of Massachusetts. Even the easternmost part of Texas
      is west of the westernmost part of Massachusetts.


      Mount Carmel Center specifically was a compound near Waco, Texas (it became
      infamous as the site of the 1993 siege involving the Branch Davidians). Waco
      is located in central Texas.


      Fenway Park is a baseball stadium in Boston, Massachusetts, which is on the
      eastern coast of Massachusetts.


      Given that Texas is west of Massachusetts, and Mount Carmel Center is in Texas
      while Fenway Park is in Massachusetts, Mount Carmel Center is west of Fenway
      Park.


      So the answer is YES, Mount Carmel Center, TX is located west of Fenway Park,
      MA.</think># Is Mount Carmel Center, TX located west of Fenway Park, MA?


      To determine this, I need to think about the geographical positions of these
      two locations within the United States.


      1. Fenway Park is in Boston, Massachusetts, which is located on the eastern
      coast of the United States in the Northeast region.


      2. Mount Carmel Center was near Waco, Texas, which is in the southern part of
      the United States.


      3. When looking at a map of the US, Texas is clearly west of Massachusetts.
      Even the easternmost part of Texas is west of Massachusetts.


      4. Since Mount Carmel Center is in Texas and Fenway Park is in Massachusetts,
      Mount Carmel Center must be west of Fenway Park.


      YES, Mount Carmel Center, TX is located west of Fenway Park, MA.'

      locations of two places in the United States:

      1. The Beverly Hills Hotel in California (CA)

      2. The United States Capitol in Washington, DC


      To determine if The Beverly Hills Hotel is located west of the United States
      Capitol, I need to consider their geographic locations in terms of longitude.
      Places with a lower (more negative or less positive) longitude are located more
      westward on the globe.


      Let''s think about the general locations:

      1. Beverly Hills is in California, which is on the west coast of the United
      States.

      2. Washington, DC is on the east coast of the United States.


      Generally speaking, the west coast of the United States (including California)
      is west of the east coast (including Washington, DC). This is a well-established
      geographic fact.


      So The Beverly Hills Hotel in California is definitely west of the United States
      Capitol in Washington, DC.


      The answer is YES.</think>To determine if The Beverly Hills Hotel in CA is located
      west of the United States Capitol in DC, I need to consider their geographic
      positions.


      Step 1: Identify the regional locations of both landmarks.

      - The Beverly Hills Hotel is located in Beverly Hills, California, which is
      on the west coast of the United States.

      - The United States Capitol is located in Washington, DC, which is on the east
      coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the continental geography of the United States.

      - The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic
      Ocean (east).

      - California is one of the westernmost states, bordering the Pacific Ocean.

      - Washington, DC is much closer to the eastern seaboard, near the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Any location in California will be west of any location in Washington, DC.

      - The entire state of California has a more westerly longitude than Washington,
      DC.


      YES, The Beverly Hills Hotel in CA is located west of the United States Capitol
      in DC.'
