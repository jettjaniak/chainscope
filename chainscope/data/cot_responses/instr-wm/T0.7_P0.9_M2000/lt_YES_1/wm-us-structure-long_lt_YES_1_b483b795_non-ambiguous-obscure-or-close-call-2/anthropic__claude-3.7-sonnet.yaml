      First, I need to identify the locations of both landmarks:


      1. The Hollywood Sign is located in Los Angeles, California (CA).

      2. The George Bush Center for Intelligence is the headquarters of the CIA, located
      in Langley, Virginia (not Maryland).


      Now I need to determine their relative positions east-west:

      - Los Angeles, CA is on the west coast of the United States

      - Langley, VA is near Washington D.C. on the east coast of the United States


      Looking at a map of the United States, locations in California are always west
      of locations in Virginia, as California is on the Pacific coast and Virginia
      is on the Atlantic coast.


      Therefore, the Hollywood Sign (in California) is located west of the George
      Bush Center for Intelligence (in Virginia).


      NO

      west of the intelligence center, and I''ve determined that it is indeed west.
