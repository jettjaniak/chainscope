      \ whether the Hollywood Sign in California is west of the George Bush Center\
      \ for Intelligence in Maryland. Hmm. I need to figure out the approximate longitudes\
      \ of both locations because west and east are determined by longitude. \n\n\
      First, I should recall where these places are. The Hollywood Sign is in Los\
      \ Angeles, California. The George Bush Center for Intelligence is the headquarters\
      \ of the CIA, located in Langley, Maryland, which is near Washington D.C. \n\
      \nNow, to compare their positions east or west, longitude is key. Places with\
      \ higher longitude values (more positive) are further east if we consider that\
      \ the prime meridian is 0 degrees. Wait, no. Actually, in the western hemisphere\
      \ (like the Americas), longitudes are west of the prime meridian, which are\
      \ measured as negative degrees. So for the US, which is in the Western Hemisphere,\
      \ longitudes are typically negative. The more negative the longitude, the further\
      \ west it is.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the actual coordinates. Let's start\
      \ with the Hollywood Sign. I think Los Angeles is around 118 degrees west longitude.\
      \ For Langley, Maryland, near Washington D.C., the longitude is around 77 degrees\
      \ west. So when comparing, the Hollywood Sign at 118\xB0W would be west of the\
      \ CIA headquarters at 77\xB0W because 118 is a larger number in the west (more\
      \ negative if using decimal degrees with west as negative), meaning further\
      \ west. So, yes, California is west of Maryland. Therefore, the Hollywood Sign\
      \ is west of the George Bush Center. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the exact\
      \ coordinates. Let me think: Washington D.C. is at approximately 77\xB0W longitude.\
      \ Los Angeles is about 118\xB0W. So since 118 is a higher number west, that's\
      \ further west. So yes, Hollywood Sign is west of the CIA location in Maryland.\
      \ Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>To determine if the Hollywood\
      \ Sign, CA is west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence, MD:  \n1. **Identify\
      \ locations**: The Hollywood Sign is in Los Angeles, CA (longitude ~118\xB0\
      W). The George Bush Center is in Langley, MD (longitude ~77\xB0W).  \n2. **Compare\
      \ longitudes**: A more westerly longitude (higher numerical value in the Western\
      \ Hemisphere) indicates a location further west.  \n3. **Conclusion**: 118\xB0\
      W (Hollywood Sign) is farther west than 77\xB0W (George Bush Center).  \n\n\
      **Answer**: YES"
    42f02030-8da9-4a56-8cbb-1a82d5dfb398: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the Hollywood Sign in California is west of the George Bush Center\
      \ for Intelligence in Maryland. Hmm, I need to figure out their longitudes because\
      \ west means a more negative or smaller longitude if we're using the standard\
      \ coordinate system where longitude decreases as you go west from the prime\
      \ meridian.\n\nFirst, I need to find the locations of both places. The Hollywood\
      \ Sign is in Los Angeles, California. The George Bush Center for Intelligence\
      \ is the headquarters of the CIA, located in Langley, Virginia, which is in\
      \ Maryland? Wait, no. Wait, Langley is actually in Virginia, right? Because\
      \ the CIA headquarters is in Langley, Virginia. Maybe the question has a mistake\
      \ in the state abbreviation? Let me check that. The CIA's main office is indeed\
      \ in Langley, Fairfax County, Virginia. So maybe the question mistakenly says\
      \ MD (Maryland) instead of VA (Virginia). That's possible. But assuming the\
      \ question is correct as given, the George Bush Center is in MD. Wait, maybe\
      \ there's another location? Or perhaps the user made an error. Well, I should\
      \ proceed with the information given, but maybe verify that. Alternatively,\
      \ maybe there's a George Bush Center for Intelligence in Maryland. Let me think.\
      \ No, I'm pretty sure the main CIA headquarters is in Langley, VA. So perhaps\
      \ the question has a typo, but I'll proceed as if it's in MD as stated. \n\n\
      But wait, if it's in Maryland, then where exactly? Let's see. If the user says\
      \ MD, maybe it's near Washington D.C., which is bordered by both Virginia and\
      \ Maryland. The CIA is in Virginia, but maybe the question is referring to another\
      \ facility? Maybe a different Bush Center? Wait, George Bush Center for Intelligence\
      \ is the official name of the CIA headquarters. So the user might have confused\
      \ Maryland (MD) with Virginia (VA). But since the question states MD, I have\
      \ to go with that. Alternatively, maybe the user is correct, and I'm mistaken.\
      \ Let me double-check quickly. \n\nQuick check: The George Bush Center for Intelligence\
      \ is the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. So MD is incorrect. But the\
      \ question says MD. Hmm. Maybe it's a trick question. Alternatively, maybe there's\
      \ another place with the same name in Maryland. But I can't think of one. Maybe\
      \ the user intended Virginia but wrote MD. But since the question says MD, I\
      \ have to answer based on that. \n\nSo proceeding: Hollywood Sign, CA (California)\
      \ vs. George Bush Center, MD (Maryland). Now, to determine which is further\
      \ west. \n\nFirst, find the longitude of Hollywood Sign. The Hollywood Sign\
      \ is located in Los Angeles, CA. The approximate longitude of LA is around 118\
      \ degrees West. Let's say 118.2437\xB0 W. \n\nNow, the George Bush Center in\
      \ MD. If it's in Maryland, where in Maryland? The state of Maryland is on the\
      \ East Coast. Its approximate longitude would be around 76-77 degrees West.\
      \ For example, Baltimore, MD is around 76.6120\xB0 W. The capital, Annapolis,\
      \ is about 76.4929\xB0 W. So Maryland's longitude is roughly 75\xB0W to 79\xB0\
      W. \n\nComparing the two: Hollywood Sign at ~118\xB0W and the CIA center in\
      \ MD (if it were there) at ~76\xB0W. Since longitude increases as you go west\
      \ (but wait, no: longitude is measured from 0\xB0 at Greenwich, going west to\
      \ 180\xB0W and east to 180\xB0E. So for the US, all longitudes are West, so\
      \ higher numbers as you go west. So California is around 118-124\xB0W, Maryland\
      \ around 75-79\xB0W. Therefore, Hollywood Sign is west of Maryland because 118\xB0\
      W is more west than 76\xB0W. Wait, but 118 is a larger number west, so further\
      \ west. So yes, California is west of Maryland. Therefore, the Hollywood Sign\
      \ is west of the George Bush Center in MD. But wait, the problem is that if\
      \ the George Bush Center is actually in Virginia (which is next to Maryland\
      \ but slightly south), then Virginia's longitude is similar, maybe around 77\xB0\
      W (like Langley, VA is approx 77.1653\xB0 W). So even if it's in Virginia, the\
      \ longitude would still be around 77\xB0W, which is east of California's 118\xB0\
      W. So regardless of MD or VA, the answer would be YES, Hollywood is west. But\
      \ the question states MD, so even if the user made a mistake in the state, the\
      \ answer remains YES. \n\nSo the answer is YES, because California is west of\
      \ Maryland (and Virginia), so the Hollywood Sign is west of the George Bush\
      \ Center, regardless of the state mix-up.\n</think>The Hollywood Sign in California\
      \ is located at approximately 118.2437\xB0 W longitude, while the George Bush\
      \ Center for Intelligence (CIA headquarters) is in Langley, Virginia (not Maryland),\
      \ at around 77.1653\xB0 W. However, even if mistakenly placed in Maryland (which\
      \ averages ~76\xB0 W), the Hollywood Sign's longitude is significantly farther\
      \ west. Since a higher numerical value in west longitude indicates a more westerly\
      \ location, **YES**, the Hollywood Sign, CA is west of the George Bush Center\
      \ for Intelligence, MD (or VA). \n\nANSWER: YES"
    43b06b3f-ca1e-4511-ba6d-8f83d9ab8c30: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the user is asking if the Hollywood Sign in California is located west\
      \ of the George Bush Center for Intelligence in Maryland. Hmm, okay, first,\
      \ I need to figure out the locations of both places and their longitudes because\
      \ west or east is determined by longitude. \n\nStarting with the Hollywood Sign.\
      \ I know it's in Los Angeles, California. California is on the west coast of\
      \ the US, so I'm guessing its longitude is going to be west, maybe around 118\
      \ degrees West? Let me confirm that. A quick check (or from memory), the coordinates\
      \ for the Hollywood Sign are approximately 34.1341\xB0 N latitude and 118.3215\xB0\
      \ W longitude.\n\nNow, the George Bush Center for Intelligence. That's the headquarters\
      \ of the CIA, right? Located in Langley, Maryland. Maryland is on the east coast,\
      \ near Washington D.C. So its longitude should be around 77 degrees West. Let\
      \ me verify. The coordinates for the CIA headquarters are roughly 38.9517\xB0\
      \ N latitude and 77.1464\xB0 W longitude.\n\nSo now comparing the longitudes:\
      \ Hollywood Sign is at 118.32\xB0W and the CIA center is at 77.15\xB0W. Since\
      \ longitude increases as you go west from the prime meridian (0\xB0), a higher\
      \ numerical value in the west means it's further west. So, 118\xB0W is west\
      \ of 77\xB0W. Therefore, the Hollywood Sign in CA is indeed west of the George\
      \ Bush Center in MD. \n\nWait, but wait\u2014let me make sure there's no confusion\
      \ here. Sometimes people mix up east and west, but longitude west means locations\
      \ are in the Western Hemisphere. Since both are in the US, the one with the\
      \ higher west longitude is further west. Yes, California is much further west\
      \ than Maryland. For example, Los Angeles is on the Pacific coast, while Maryland\
      \ is on the Atlantic coast. So yes, the Hollywood Sign is west of the CIA headquarters.\
      \ \n\nI think that's it. The answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Steps:**\
      \  \n1. **Locate the Hollywood Sign, CA**: Coordinates ~34.1341\xB0 N, 118.3215\xB0\

    4d959338-6764-4845-921b-a74d98754e87: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the Hollywood Sign in California is west of the George Bush Center\

      \ I know that the Hollywood Sign is in Los Angeles, California. California is\
      \ on the west coast of the US, so its longitude should be pretty far west. The\
      \ George Bush Center for Intelligence is in Maryland, which is on the east coast.\
      \ But I need to get the specific longitudes to compare.\n\nLet me recall: The\
      \ US uses the western hemisphere longitudes, which are negative numbers. The\
      \ further west a location is, the more negative (or smaller) its longitude value.\
      \ So if Hollywood Sign has a longitude that's more west (more negative) than\
      \ the Center's, then the answer is yes.\n\nI think the Hollywood Sign is around\
      \ Los Angeles. Let me try to remember the approximate longitude of LA. Los Angeles\
      \ is roughly around 118 degrees West longitude. Maryland is on the east coast,\
      \ so maybe the George Bush Center is near Washington D.C., which is around 77\
      \ degrees West longitude. Wait, but Maryland is a bit north of D.C. Maybe the\
      \ Center is in the D.C. area? Let me confirm the headquarters the headquarters\
      \ the headquarters of the CIA, right? And the CIA headquarters is in Langley,\
      \ Virginia. Wait, Virginia is next to Maryland. Wait, no, Langley is in Virginia,\
      \ which is south of Maryland. But maybe the question says Maryland, so perhaps\
      \ I'm mixing up the location. Wait, the user said George Bush Center for Intelligence,\
      \ MD. So Maryland. But I thought the CIA is in Virginia. Maybe there's a different\
      \ facility? Or maybe the user made a mistake. Hmm, maybe I should check that\
      \ first.\n\nWait, quick fact check: The CIA headquarters is indeed located in\
      \ Langley, Virginia. So maybe the question has a typo, and it's supposed to\
      \ be VA (Virginia) instead of MD (Maryland). But the user specified MD. Alternatively,\
      \ perhaps there's a George Bush Center in Maryland. Let me think. Wait, George\
      \ H.W. Bush was director of CIA, but the center named after him is the CIA headquarters\
      \ in Langley, VA. So maybe the question is incorrect in stating MD. But assuming\
      \ the user's information is correct, that the Center is in Maryland, then I\
      \ need to find its longitude.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user confused Maryland\
      \ with Virginia. But regardless, I need to proceed with the given info. So,\
      \ assuming the George Bush Center for Intelligence is in Maryland, where in\
      \ Maryland? The capital of Maryland is Annapolis, but Baltimore. The Baltimore.\
      \ The approximate longitude for Maryland would be around 76 to 77 degrees West.\
      \ For example, Baltimore is around 76.6\xB0 W. So if the Center is in Maryland,\
      \ say near Baltimore or another city, its longitude would be approximately 76-77\xB0\
      \ W.\n\nMeanwhile, Hollywood Sign in LA is around 118.3\xB0 W. So comparing\
      \ 118.3\xB0 W (Hollywood) vs. 76\xB0 W (Maryland). Since 118 is more west (more\
      \ negative) than 76, Hollywood is indeed west of the Maryland location. Therefore,\
      \ the answer would be YES.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that the Center\
      \ is actually in Maryland. If it's in Virginia, then Virginia's longitude is\
      \ similar to Maryland's, maybe around 77\xB0 W. Either way, LA is much further\
      \ west. So regardless of whether the Center is in MD or VA, Hollywood is west\
      \ of it. So the answer is YES.\n</think>YES. The Hollywood Sign in California\
      \ is located at approximately 118.3\xB0W longitude, while the George Bush Center\
      \ for Intelligence (CIA Headquarters) in Maryland is around 77\xB0W longitude.\
      \ Since lower (more negative) longitude values are further west, Hollywood Sign\
      \ is indeed west of the Maryland location. \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    54042c66-51ff-4ef0-8de5-5236d43ee1f6: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. The user wants to know if the Hollywood Sign in California is\

      \ first, I need to figure out the locations of both landmarks.\n\nStarting with\
      \ the Hollywood Sign. I know that's in Los Angeles, California. It's on Mount\
      \ Lee in the Santa Monica Mountains. So I should get the coordinates for that.\
      \ From what I remember, Los Angeles is on the west coast of the US, so its longitude\
      \ should be around 118 degrees west. Let me confirm that. Yes, the Hollywood\
      \ Sign's coordinates are approximately 34.1341\xB0 N, 118.3216\xB0 W.\n\nNext,\
      \ the George Bush Center for Intelligence. That's the headquarters of the CIA\
      \ in Langley, Virginia, not Maryland. Wait, the question says Maryland. Is that\
      \ correct? Hmm, Langley is indeed in Virginia, near Washington D.C. Maybe the\
      \ user made a mistake, but I should check. Let me verify. The CIA headquarters\
      \ is at 38.9519\xB0 N, 77.1464\xB0 W, in Langley, Virginia. So the question\
      \ might have an error regarding the state, but I'll proceed with the coordinates\
      \ given.\n\nNow, comparing the longitudes. The key here is that west longitude\
      \ means how far west a place is from the prime meridian. So a location with\
      \ a higher west longitude (a larger number) is further west. For example, if\
      \ one is at 118\xB0W and another is at 77\xB0W, the one at 118\xB0W is further\
      \ west because 118 is greater than 77. \n\nSo the Hollywood Sign is at 118.3216\xB0\
      W, and the CIA headquarters is at 77.1464\xB0W. Since 118 is greater than 77,\
      \ the Hollywood Sign is indeed west of the CIA location. Even though California\
      \ is on the west coast and Virginia is on the east coast, comparing their exact\
      \ longitudes confirms this. \n\nWait, but does the longitude being more west\
      \ mean it's further west? Yes, because longitude increases as you go west from\
      \ the prime meridian (0\xB0) up to 180\xB0 in the Pacific. So a higher degree\
      \ in the west longitude means further west. Therefore, Hollywood Sign's longitude\
      \ is further west than the CIA's, making the answer YES.\n</think>The Hollywood\
      \ Sign in California has coordinates approximately 34.1341\xB0 N, 118.3216\xB0\

      \ Langley, Virginia (not Maryland, but the state discrepancy does not affect\
      \ longitude comparison) at 38.9519\xB0 N, 77.1464\xB0 W. West longitude increases\
      \ as you move westward from the prime meridian. Since 118.3216\xB0 W (Hollywood)\
      \ is a **greater** west longitude than 77.1464\xB0 W (CIA), the Hollywood Sign\
      \ lies **west** of the CIA headquarters. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    593f90fb-5a29-45a8-9c3a-3b6a2a11a739: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the Hollywood Sign in California is west of the George Bush Center\
      \ for Intelligence in Maryland. Hmm. First, I need to figure out where each\
      \ of these landmarks is located.\n\nStarting with the Hollywood Sign. I know\
      \ that's in Los Angeles, California. It's up in the hills, right? So LA is on\
      \ the west coast of the US. Now, the George Bush Center for Intelligence\u2014\
      that's the CIA headquarters, isn't it? Located in Langley, Maryland. Maryland\
      \ is on the east coast, near Washington D.C. \n\nNow, comparing their longitudes.\
      \ Since the US spans from east to west, the further west a location is, the\
      \ higher its longitude value (in the western hemisphere, longitudes are negative,\
      \ but when considering east vs west, California would have a more negative longitude\
      \ than Maryland). Wait, actually, longitude degrees decrease as you go west\
      \ from the prime meridian. So places on the west coast like California have\
      \ more western longitudes (more negative when expressed as a negative number)\
      \ compared to the east coast.\n\nMaryland is on the east coast, so its longitude\
      \ would be around -77 degrees (since Washington D.C. is about -77.04). Los Angeles\
      \ is around -118.24 degrees. So comparing -118 (Hollywood) and -77 (Maryland).\
      \ Since -118 is more to the west (more negative), that means Hollywood Sign\
      \ is west of the George Bush Center. \n\nWait, but longitude lines go from 0\
      \ at Greenwich, increasing eastward to 180 and westward to -180. So a lower\

      \ west (more negative) than -77.12, Hollywood Sign is west of the George Bush\
      \ Center.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    76ed9a45-ce68-488a-ae84-17304eaa517a: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure this out.\
      \ The question is whether the Hollywood Sign in California is west of the George\
      \ Bush Center for Intelligence in Maryland. \n\nFirst, I need to know where\
      \ these two landmarks are located. The Hollywood Sign is in Los Angeles, California.\
      \ The George Bush Center for Intelligence is in McLean, Virginia, which is part\
      \ of the Washington D.C. area. Wait, the question says Maryland, but I thought\
      \ the CIA headquarters is in Virginia. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake or\
      \ maybe I'm misremembering. Let me check that. \n\nRight, the George Bush Center\
      \ for Intelligence is the headquarters of the CIA, located in Langley, Virginia.\
      \ So the question mentions MD (Maryland), but it's actually in VA. Maybe that's\
      \ a typo. But regardless, the main point is comparing their longitudes.\n\n\
      Now, to determine if one is west of the other, I need to look at their geographic\
      \ coordinates. The Hollywood Sign's coordinates are approximately 34.1341\xB0\
      \ N, 118.3215\xB0 W. The CIA headquarters in Virginia is at around 38.9517\xB0\
      \ N, 77.1464\xB0 W. \n\nWait, longitude: a higher west value means further west.\
      \ So 118.3215\xB0 W (Hollywood) vs. 77.1464\xB0 W (Virginia). Since 118 is greater\
      \ than 77, Hollywood is further west. So even though California is on the west\
      \ coast and Virginia is on the east coast, the longitude numbers show that Hollywood\
      \ is west of the CIA HQ. But the original question mentions Maryland. Wait,\
      \ maybe the user confused Maryland with Virginia. The CIA is in Virginia, not\
      \ Maryland. So if we consider the CIA in Virginia, then yes, Hollywood is west.\
      \ But if we take the question as given, which says the George Bush Center is\
      \ in MD, then maybe there's a different location. \n\nWait, is there a George\
      \ Bush Center for Intelligence in Maryland? Let me confirm. The main CIA headquarters\
      \ is in Langley, VA. Maryland does have other intelligence facilities, like\
      \ NSA headquarters at Fort Meade, MD. But the George Bush Center is specifically\
      \ the CIA's, which is in VA. So perhaps the question has an error. But regardless,\
      \ assuming the user intended the CIA HQ in Virginia, then Hollywood, CA is west\
      \ of that. But if there's a place in Maryland called George Bush Center for\
      \ Intelligence, which I don't think exists, then maybe the answer is different.\
      \ \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to refer to the correct location\
      \ but mistakenly wrote MD instead of VA. In that case, the answer is still yes.\
      \ Because California is west of Virginia. To confirm, looking at longitude:\
      \ the further west a place is, the higher the west longitude (since it's measured\
      \ as degrees west of the prime meridian). So Los Angeles at 118\xB0W is much\

      \ Virginia is south of Maryland. Let's think about the states. Washington D.C.\

    85b70055-861f-4b52-8c29-0df5265540cd: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure out if\
      \ the Hollywood Sign in California is west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence\
      \ in Maryland. Hmm, I need to compare their longitudes because west means a\
      \ more negative or smaller longitude value.\n\nFirst, I should find the locations\
      \ of both places. The Hollywood Sign is in Los Angeles, California. I remember\
      \ that Los Angeles is on the west coast, so its longitude should be around 118\
      \ degrees west. The George Bush Center for Intelligence is the headquarters\
      \ of the CIA, right? It's located in Langley, Virginia, which is near Washington,\
      \ D.C. Wait, the question says Maryland, but Langley is actually in Virginia.\
      \ Maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check. No, the CIA headquarters is in\
      \ Langley, Virginia, not Maryland. Maybe the user meant the state abbreviation?\
      \ MD is Maryland, but the Bush Center is in VA. Perhaps the question has a typo.\
      \ Or maybe there's another George Bush Center in Maryland? Let me confirm. A\

      \ VA. So the question might have an error. But assuming the user intended the\
      \ CIA headquarters in VA, then proceed. Wait, the user specifically said MD.\
      \ Maybe there's a different center? Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are\
      \ still comparable. Let's proceed with the correct locations regardless. \n\n\
      So, the Hollywood Sign's coordinates: approximately 34.1341\xB0 N, 118.3215\xB0\
      \ W. The CIA Headquarters in Langley, VA is around 38.9517\xB0 N, 77.1447\xB0\
      \ W. \n\nComparing longitudes: Hollywood is at 118.3\xB0W, Langley at 77.1\xB0\
      W. Since west longitude is measured as negative degrees, -118.3 is more west\
      \ than -77.1. So Hollywood is further west. Therefore, yes, Hollywood Sign is\
      \ west of the CIA HQ in VA. But the question mentioned MD. Wait, if the Bush\

      \ maybe near Washington, D.C. The longitude of Maryland's eastern parts are\
      \ around 75-79\xB0W. For example, Baltimore is around 76.6\xB0W. So if the Bush\
      \ Center in MD is in the eastern part, say 76\xB0W, then Hollywood at 118\xB0\
      W is west of that. Wait, but lower longitude (more east) would mean Hollywood,\
      \ being at 118W (more west), is indeed west of a place at 77W. Wait, no. Wait,\
      \ longitude west decreases as you go east. So a place at 77\xB0W is east of\
      \ 118\xB0W. Therefore, Hollywood (118W) is west of the Bush Center in MD (say\
      \ 77W). So the answer is yes. Even if the Bush Center is in MD (which might\
      \ have a longitude similar to VA, around 77W), Hollywood is further west. So\
      \ the answer is YES.\n</think>The Hollywood Sign in California is located at\

      \ But maybe the user made a mistake. Let me check. The George Bush Center for\
      \ Intelligence, also known as the CIA headquarters, is indeed in Langley, Virginia.\
      \ So the state should be VA, not MD. But the question says MD. Maybe there's\
      \ another George Bush Center in Maryland? I need to verify. Hmm, a quick search\
      \ in my mind\u2014I don't recall a major facility by that name in Maryland.\
      \ The main CIA HQ is in Virginia. So perhaps the user mixed up the states. But\
      \ the question says MD, so maybe I should proceed as if it's in Maryland, but\
      \ maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended Virginia.\
      \ But let's stick to the question's wording: George Bush Center for Intelligence,\
      \ MD. Wait, but Maryland (MD) is a different state from Virginia (VA). So if\
      \ the center is in Virginia, then the question's premise has an error. However,\
      \ perhaps the user intended the correct location but got the state wrong. Alternatively,\
      \ there might be another facility in Maryland. Let's try to find the coordinates.\
      \ \n\nAssuming the CIA HQ in Virginia: Langley, VA. Its coordinates are approximately\
      \ 38\xB057'06\"N latitude and 77\xB008'48\"W longitude. Now, if we compare the\
      \ longitudes. The Hollywood Sign is at 118\xB0W, and the CIA HQ is at 77\xB0\
      W. Since longitude increases westward in the western hemisphere, a higher degree\
      \ west means further west. So 118\xB0W is west of 77\xB0W. Therefore, Hollywood\
      \ Sign would be west of the CIA HQ in Virginia. But the question says MD. If\
      \ there is a George Bush Center in Maryland, maybe in College Park or another\
      \ location? For example, the NSA is in Maryland, but that's a different agency.\
      \ Wait, perhaps the user is confusing the George H.W. Bush Center at the CIA\
      \ (in VA) with something else in MD. Alternatively, maybe the coordinates for\
      \ the center in MD would have a different longitude. Let's suppose that, despite\
      \ possible confusion, the user is referring to the CIA HQ in Virginia but mistakenly\
      \ listed MD. If we proceed with the actual CIA location in Virginia (77\xB0\
      W), then Hollywood at 118\xB0W is indeed west of it. But if the center were\
      \ in Maryland, where is Maryland's longitude? Maryland's eastern part is around\
      \ 75\xB0W (like Ocean City), and the western part might be around 79\xB0W. For\
      \ example, Baltimore is around 76\xB0W, and the westernmost part of MD is about\
      \ 79\xB0W. So if the center were in Maryland, say in the eastern part (near\
      \ DC), maybe around 77\xB0W as well. For example, the coordinates for Langley,\
      \ VA is near the Potomac River, close to DC. If the center were in MD near DC,\
      \ like in Bethesda or somewhere, the longitude would be similar to DC, which\
      \ is around 77\xB0W. So in any case, whether the center is in VA or MD near\
      \ DC, its longitude is roughly 77\xB0W. Hollywood is at 118\xB0W. 118 is west\

    125e1de2-4be1-4b09-947b-888355678779: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, I need to determine if Mount Carmel Center, Texas is located west of Fenway\
      \ Park in Massachusetts. Hmm, first, I should probably figure out the approximate\
      \ longitudes of both places since west vs. east is determined by longitude.\n\
      \nWait, I know that in the US, as you go from the East Coast to the West Coast,\
      \ the longitude becomes more negative because the US uses the western hemisphere\
      \ longitudes (west of the Prime Meridian). So places further east in the US,\
      \ like Massachusetts, would have a longitude closer to, say, -70 degrees, while\
      \ Texas, being more west, would be more like -95 to -100 degrees or something.\
      \ But I'm not exactly sure. Let me check mentally.\n\nFenway Park is in Boston,\
      \ Massachusetts. Boston is on the east coast. So its longitude should be around\
      \ -71 degrees or so. I think Boston is roughly at 71\xB0W. Now, Mount Carmel\
      \ Center in Texas\u2014I need to figure out where that is. Wait, Mount Carmel\u2014\
      there's a Mount Carmel in Texas? Let me recall. There's a Waco, Texas area where\
      \ the Branch Davidians had a compound called Mount Carmel. That's the Mount\
      \ Carmel Center, maybe? That was near Waco. So Waco, Texas is in central Texas.\
      \ Central Texas would be around 97 degrees West longitude, perhaps? Because\
      \ Texas spans from around 93\xB0W to 106\xB0W, roughly. So Waco is in the central\
      \ part, probably around 97\xB0W.\n\nSo then, if Fenway Park is at approximately\
      \ -71\xB0 longitude, and Mount Carmel Center is around -97\xB0, then -97 is\
      \ more west than -71. Since longitude decreases as you go west in the Western\
      \ Hemisphere. Wait, no\u2014longitude in the Western Hemisphere is measured\
      \ as degrees west, so larger numerical values (when considered as absolute)\
      \ mean further west. So, for example, 70\xB0W is further east than 80\xB0W.\
      \ Wait, but when expressed as negative numbers (since west longitudes are negative\
      \ in the standard coordinate system where east is positive), then -70 is larger\
      \ (less negative) than -80. So -97 is more west than -71 because -97 is a smaller\
      \ number (more negative) than -71. Wait, no: In terms of west, lower (more negative)\
      \ numbers are further west. Wait, no. Let me think again. The Prime Meridian\
      \ is 0. As you go west, the longitude becomes negative. So each degree west\
      \ is a negative number. So, for example, New York is around -74\xB0; Chicago\
      \ is around -87\xB0; Los Angeles is around -118\xB0. So as you go west, the\
      \ longitude becomes more negative. Therefore, the more negative the longitude,\
      \ the further west it is. So, comparing -97 (Mount Carmel) and -71 (Fenway),\
      \ -97 is more west. Therefore, yes, Mount Carmel Center is west of Fenway Park.\n\
      \nBut wait, let me confirm the exact locations. Maybe I should get the precise\
      \ coordinates. But I can't look it up, but I can try to recall. Fenway Park\

      \ in Boston, MA. Now, where exactly is Boston? Boston is on the east coast of\

      \ But since I'm recalling, Boston is definitely in the Eastern Time Zone, which\
      \ is UTC-5, so its longitude should be around 71\xB0W.\n\nNext, Mount Carmel\

      \ their compound was called Mount Carmel Center. Yes, that's right. So Mount\
      \ Carmel Center is near Waco, Texas.\n\nNow, Waco is in central Texas. Let me\
      \ recall the approximate coordinates. Texas is in the Central Time Zone, which\
      \ is UTC-6, but some parts might be in Mountain Time? Wait, no, most of Texas\
      \ is Central, except for the western tip which is Mountain. So Waco would be\
      \ Central Time, which is around 97 degrees west longitude, maybe. Let me think,\
      \ Austin is around 97.7\xB0W, and Dallas is about 96.8\xB0W. Waco is between\

      \ Massachusetts. Boston is on the east coast of the United States. From what\
      \ I remember, the east coast cities like Boston, New York, etc., have longitudes\
      \ that are around 70 to 75 degrees west. Let me confirm that. Maybe Boston is\
      \ around -71 degrees longitude? Because longitude west of the prime meridian\
      \ is negative in some systems.\n\nNow, Mount Carmel Center in Texas. I'm not\
      \ exactly sure where that is. Texas is a big state, but the name sounds familiar.\

      \ whether Mount Carmel Center, TX is west of Fenway Park, MA. Hmm, I need to\
      \ figure out the approximate longitudes of both places because east and west\
      \ directions are determined by longitude. \n\nFirst, I should recall where these\
      \ two places are. Fenway Park is in Boston, Massachusetts. I know Boston is\
      \ on the east coast of the US, so its longitude should be around -71 degrees\
      \ or so. Mount Carmel Center, TX\u2014I'm not exactly sure where that is. Texas\

      \ I might be mixing it up with other places. Wait, there's a Mount Carmel in\
      \ Texas? Maybe in the central or western part? Texas spans from around -93 to\
      \ -106 degrees longitude, I think. So if Fenway Park is around -71, and Mount\
      \ Carmel Center is in Texas, say, maybe around -97 or something, then it would\
      \ be west.\n\nWait, let me get more precise. Let me try to remember or estimate.\
      \ Boston, MA: the longitude is approximately 71 degrees west, so -71.0. For\
      \ Texas, major cities like Dallas are around -96.8, Houston around -95.4, El\
      \ Paso is way west at -106.5. If Mount Carmel Center is in central Texas, maybe\
      \ near Waco or somewhere, which is around -97. So that would be west of Boston's\
      \ -71. But wait, west longitude becomes more negative as you go west. So -97\
      \ is west of -71 because -97 is a lower number (more west). So yes, if Mount\
      \ Carmel Center is in Texas, even central Texas, it's definitely west of Boston.\
      \ \n\nBut wait, is there a Mount Carmel Center in Texas? Maybe I should confirm\
      \ that. Maybe it's a specific place. Let me think. Mount Carmel could be a town\
      \ or a community. For example, there's a Mount Carmel in Texas, perhaps a small\
      \ town. Let me check mentally. Texas has a lot of small towns. Alternatively,\
      \ maybe it's a religious center or something. But regardless, as long as it's\
      \ in Texas, which is west of Massachusetts, then the answer is yes. Because\
      \ Texas is in the Central or Mountain time zone, while Massachusetts is Eastern.\
      \ So even the easternmost part of Texas is still west of Massachusetts. Wait,\
      \ but the easternmost point in Texas is around -94 degrees longitude, which\
      \ is still west of Boston's -71. Because -94 is more west than -71. So even\
      \ the eastern edge of Texas is west of Boston. Therefore, any location in Texas\

      \ check that. Yep, Fenway Park's coordinates are approximately 42\xB020'46\"\

      \ Where is that? I think there's a Mount Carmel in Texas, but maybe it's a specific\

    b0437f9c-8de5-4f50-bdc7-4611c65e1b02: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Mount Carmel Center, TX is west of Fenway Park in Massachusetts. Let me start\

      \ stadium in Boston, Massachusetts. I know Boston is on the east coast of the\
      \ US, so its longitude should be pretty far east. Mount Carmel Center, Texas\u2014\
      I'm not as familiar with that. Maybe it's a small town? Let me check my memory:\
      \ Texas is in the southern part of the US and spans a lot of longitude. The\
      \ eastern part of Texas is closer to the Gulf of Mexico, so cities like Houston\
      \ are there, which are definitely east. But the western part of Texas would\
      \ be near places like El Paso, which is way west, actually in the Mountain Time\
      \ Zone.\n\nWait, but the question is about Mount Carmel Center. I'm not sure\
      \ where exactly that is. I might need to look up the approximate coordinates.\
      \ But since I can't actually search, I'll have to use what I know. Let me think:\
      \ There's a place called Mount Carmel in Texas? Maybe it's a small town. I remember\
      \ Waco, Texas has some significance. Is Mount Carmel near there? There was the\
      \ Branch Davidian incident in Waco in the 90s; I think their compound was called\
      \ Mount Carmel. If that's the case, then Waco is in central Texas. So where\
      \ is central Texas in terms of longitude?\n\nFenway Park's longitude is around\
      \ 71 degrees west, I think. Boston is at approximately 42 degrees north latitude,\
      \ 71 degrees west longitude. Now, central Texas, like Austin, is around 97 or\
      \ 98 degrees west longitude. Wait, longitude increases as you go west, right?\
      \ Wait, no. Wait, longitude is measured from the prime meridian (0 degrees)\
      \ going east or west up to 180. So for the US, all longitudes are west, so they're\
      \ measured as degrees west. So Boston is approximately 71 degrees west longitude.\
      \ Places further west, like Austin, Texas, would have higher numbers. For example,\
      \ Austin is around 97 degrees west. So 97 is west of 71. So if Mount Carmel\
      \ Center is in central Texas, near Waco, then yes, its longitude is higher (more\
      \ west) than Boston's. Therefore, it would be west of Fenway Park.\n\nBut wait,\
      \ let me check if Mount Carmel Center is indeed in central Texas. The Branch\
      \ Davidian compound was near Waco, which is in McLennan County, Texas. If that's\
      \ the case, then Waco's longitude is about 97.1 degrees west. So that's definitely\

      \ Park is in Boston, Massachusetts, that's where the Red Sox play.\n\nNext,\
      \ I need to compare their longitudes. Since the question is about east-west\

      \ its longitude value (in the Western Hemisphere, west longitude is negative,\
      \ but when comparing, a more westerly point would have a more negative longitude,\

      \ For example, Boston is around -71 degrees, and Texas would be more west, so\
      \ maybe around -97 degrees or so. Wait, no\u2014actually, the more west you\
      \ go in the US, the longitude becomes more negative. For example, California\
      \ is around -120\xB0, while the east coast is around -70\xB0 to -80\xB0.\n\n\
      Wait, let me get this straight. The prime meridian is 0\xB0, and as you go west,\
      \ the longitude becomes negative. So Boston, MA is on the east coast, so its\
      \ longitude is, say, around -71\xB0 (as in Boston's Fenway Park is approximately\

      \ \n\nThe United States Capitol is in Washington, DC, which is on the east coast\
      \ of the United States. The Beverly Hills Hotel is in Beverly Hills, California,\
      \ which is a city in Southern California, near Los Angeles. Now, I know that\
      \ California is on the west coast, so generally, it's further west than DC.\
      \ But I should check the exact longitudes to be sure because sometimes places\
      \ might be in the same state but vary in east-west positioning.\n\nLet me think\
      \ about the longitudes. The US Capitol's coordinates are approximately 38\xB0\
      53\u203223\u2033N latitude and 77\xB000\u203232\u2033W longitude. For The Beverly\
      \ Hills Hotel, I believe Beverly Hills is around 34\xB04\u2032N latitude and\

      \ east-west positions. The more west (higher degree in the western hemisphere)\
      \ a location is, the further west it is. \n\nSo, DC's longitude is about 77\xB0\
      W, and Beverly Hills is around 118\xB0W. Since 118 is a larger number than 77\
      \ when measuring west longitude, that means Beverly Hills is indeed further\
      \ west. Therefore, the answer should be YES, The Beverly Hills Hotel is west\
      \ of the US Capitol.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't mix up the longitude.\
      \ The prime meridian is 0\xB0, and as you go west from there, the longitude\

      \ where these places are. The US Capitol is in Washington, D.C., which is on\
      \ the East Coast. Beverly Hills is in California, which is on the West Coast.\
      \ Generally, the West Coast is west of the East Coast, but maybe I need to check\
      \ the exact coordinates to be sure.\n\nI think the US Capitol's coordinates\
      \ are around 38\xB053\u203223\u2033N, 77\xB000\u203232\u2033W. Let me confirm\
      \ that. If that's correct, the longitude is 77 degrees west. Now, The Beverly\
      \ Hills Hotel, located in Beverly Hills, CA. The coordinates for Beverly Hills\
      \ might be approximately 34\xB04\u2032N, 118\xB024\u2032W. Wait, 118 degrees\
      \ west longitude. So comparing 77\xB0W and 118\xB0W. Wait, but longitude west\
      \ increases as you go west from the prime meridian. So a higher degree west\
      \ means further west. So 118\xB0W is more west than 77\xB0W. Therefore, Beverly\
      \ Hills, CA is indeed west of Washington, D.C. \n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, no,\
      \ actually, wait a second. If you have a longitude of 77 degrees west and 118\
      \ degrees west, the one with the higher number (118) is farther west. So the\
      \ Beverly Hills Hotel would be west of the Capitol. But sometimes people get\

      \ So the answer should be YES.\n\nBut let me make sure. Maybe I should check\
      \ if Beverly Hills is actually in a part of California that's west of D.C. Since\
      \ D.C. is at 77\xB0W and Beverly Hills is at 118\xB0W, the difference is about\
      \ 41 degrees. Each degree of longitude is about 69 miles (at the equator), but\

      \ in D.C. I know that Washington, D.C. is on the east coast of the US, so its\
      \ longitude is going to be somewhere in the eastern part of the country. The\

      \ right. So the longitude is approximately 77 degrees west.\n\nNow, The Beverly\
      \ Hills Hotel is in Beverly Hills, California. California is on the west coast,\
      \ so its longitude should be much further west. Let me recall the coordinates\

      04\u2032N latitude and 118\xB024\u2032W longitude. So the longitude here is\
      \ about 118 degrees west.\n\nComparing the two longitudes: 118 degrees west\
      \ (Beverly Hills) versus 77 degrees west (US Capitol). Wait, but longitude increases\
      \ as you go west, right? So the higher the degree west, the further west the\
      \ location is. Since 118 is greater than 77, that means Beverly Hills is indeed\
      \ west of the US Capitol. \n\nWait, but sometimes people get confused because\
      \ when you think of the map, west towards the left (for the US). So California\
      \ is on the left side (west) and D.C. is on the right (east). So yes, Beverly\

      \ how far east or west a location is. The higher the longitude (in the western\
      \ hemisphere), the further west it is. Wait, no, actually, longitude in the\
      \ western hemisphere is measured as west longitude, so lower numbers (more negative)\
      \ would be further west. Wait, no, maybe I should clarify. The prime meridian\
      \ is 0\xB0, and going west from there up to 180\xB0W, and east up to 180\xB0\
      E. But for the US, all locations are in the western hemisphere, so their longitudes\

      \ for Los Angeles).\n\nSo Washington, D.C.'s coordinates: I think the Capitol's\
      \ longitude is around 77 degrees West. Let me confirm. A quick check in my mind:\
      \ major East Coast cities like New York are around 74\xB0W, so D.C. being a\
      \ bit south might be around 77\xB0W. For Beverly Hills, which is in Los Angeles\

      \ (as negative degrees or up to 180\xB0W). So, in the United States, which is\
