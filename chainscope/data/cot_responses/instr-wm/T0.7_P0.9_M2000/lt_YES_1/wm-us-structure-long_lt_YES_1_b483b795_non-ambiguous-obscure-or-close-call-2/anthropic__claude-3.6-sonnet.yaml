    37e9c028-0c7d-48b1-86e9-331150bbbe23: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) First, let me identify the locations:

      - Hollywood Sign is in Los Angeles, California

      - George Bush Center for Intelligence (CIA Headquarters) is in Langley, Virginia
      (not Maryland)


      2) To determine which is more west, I need to consider their relative positions
      on the US map:

      - California is on the West Coast of the United States

      - Virginia is on the East Coast of the United States


      3) Therefore:

      - Hollywood Sign is much further west than the CIA Headquarters

      - Any location in California will be west of any location in Virginia


      YES, the Hollywood Sign is located west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence.'

    52279d6e-277d-42c2-a8be-789788a022bb: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) The Hollywood Sign is located in Los Angeles, California, which is on the
      west coast of the United States.


      2) The George Bush Center for Intelligence (CIA Headquarters) is located in
      Langley, Virginia (near Washington, D.C.), which is on the east coast of the
      United States.


      3) Any location in California will be west of any location in Virginia/Maryland
      area, as California is on the Pacific coast while Virginia/Maryland are on the
      Atlantic coast.


      Therefore:


      NO - The Hollywood Sign is located EAST of the George Bush Center for Intelligence.


      [Note: I noticed I made a mistake in my initial reasoning. The question asks
      if Hollywood Sign is west of the CIA HQ, and since Hollywood is indeed west
      of Virginia/Maryland, the correct answer is YES.]


      Final Answer: YES'
