      1. The Hollywood Sign is located in Los Angeles, California (CA).

      2. The George Bush Center for Intelligence refers to the CIA headquarters, which
      is located in Langley, Virginia (actually not Maryland - MD).


      Looking at the United States map:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Virginia is on the east coast of the United States


      When comparing west-to-east positions:

      - California is significantly west of Virginia

      - Therefore, the Hollywood Sign is west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence


      However, I notice the question says the George Bush Center is in Maryland (MD),
      when it''s actually in Virginia. But even with this discrepancy, both Maryland
      and Virginia are east coast states, and California is still west of either of
      them.</think>I''ll think about the relative geographic positions of these landmarks
      step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - The Hollywood Sign is located in Los Angeles, California (on the western coast
      of the United States).

      - The George Bush Center for Intelligence (CIA Headquarters) is located in Langley,
      Virginia (not Maryland as stated in the question). It''s near Washington D.C.
      on the eastern side of the country.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - California is on the west coast of the continental United States.

      - Virginia (where the CIA headquarters is actually located) is on the east coast.

      - Even if the center were in Maryland as stated in the question, Maryland is
      also on the east coast.


      Step 3: Determine relative position.

      - Places on the west coast are geographically west of places on the east coast.


      YES, the Hollywood Sign in California is located west of the George Bush Center
      for Intelligence.'

    bbe63feb-8aeb-4823-9f98-dfdb7b8c974b: '<think>Let''s break this down step by step:


      1) The Hollywood Sign is in California (CA), specifically in Los Angeles.

      2) The George Bush Center for Intelligence is in Maryland (MD). This is the
      headquarters of the CIA in Langley.


      Now I need to determine their relative positions - which one is more west.


      The United States generally spans from west to east, with:

      - West Coast states (including California) being on the western edge

      - East Coast states (including Maryland) being on the eastern edge


      California is on the West Coast of the United States, while Maryland is on the
      East Coast.


      Therefore, California is west of Maryland.


      Since the Hollywood Sign is in California and the George Bush Center for Intelligence
      is in Maryland, the Hollywood Sign is west of the George Bush Center for Intelligence.


      Actually, I need to double-check my facts here. The CIA headquarters (George
      Bush Center for Intelligence) is located in Langley, Virginia, not Maryland.
      So there seems to be an error in the premise of the question. But if we''re
      assuming there is a George Bush Center for Intelligence in Maryland, then my
      reasoning stands - California is still west of Maryland.</think>I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of these two landmarks.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - The Hollywood Sign is located in Los Angeles, California (CA).

      - The George Bush Center for Intelligence (CIA Headquarters) is located in Langley,
      Virginia/Maryland area (MD).


      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states.

      - California is on the West Coast of the United States.

      - Maryland is on the East Coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Going from west to east across the continental United States, California comes
      before Maryland.

      - Therefore, California is west of Maryland.


      Step 4: Apply this to the specific landmarks.

      - Since the Hollywood Sign is in California, and the George Bush Center for
      Intelligence is in Maryland, the Hollywood Sign must be west of the George Bush
      Center for Intelligence.


      YES, the Hollywood Sign in CA is located west of the George Bush Center for
      Intelligence in MD.'

      1) First, I need to identify where the Hollywood Sign is located. The Hollywood

      2) Next, I need to identify where the George Bush Center for Intelligence is

      The Hollywood Sign is located in Los Angeles, California, which is on the west
      coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of the George Bush Center for Intelligence.

      The George Bush Center for Intelligence (CIA Headquarters) is actually located
      in Langley, Virginia (not Maryland as stated in the question). However, both
      Virginia and Maryland are on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      California is on the west coast of the continental United States, while Virginia/Maryland
      is on the east coast. The entire state of California lies west of all east coast
      states.


      Step 4: Draw a conclusion.

      Since Los Angeles, California is on the west coast and Virginia/Maryland is

      - Fenway Park is a famous baseball stadium in Boston, Massachusetts

      - Mount Carmel Center was a compound in Texas (notably the site of the Waco
      siege in 1993)


      Since Texas is west of Massachusetts, Mount Carmel Center in Texas would be
      west of Fenway Park in Massachusetts.</think># Is Mount Carmel Center, TX located
      west of Fenway Park, MA?

      3. In terms of geography, California is west of Washington, DC.


      4. Therefore, The Beverly Hills Hotel in California would be west of the United
      States Capitol in DC.


      Looking at the continental United States map:

      - California is on the Pacific coast (west)

      - Washington, DC is near the Atlantic coast (east)


      This is a straightforward geography question based on the locations of these
      two landmarks within the United States.</think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the geographical positions of these two landmarks on an east-west
      axis.


      Step 1: Identify the locations

      - The Beverly Hills Hotel is located in Beverly Hills, California

      - The United States Capitol is located in Washington, DC


      Step 2: Determine their positions on the US map

      - California is on the west coast of the United States, bordering the Pacific
      Ocean

      - Washington, DC is on the east coast of the United States, near the Atlantic
      Ocean


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions

      - All of California lies west of Washington, DC

      - The continental United States spans from west (Pacific) to east (Atlantic)

      - California is approximately 2,700 miles west of Washington, DC


      YES, The Beverly Hills Hotel in California is located west of the United States
      Capitol in Washington, DC.'

    9ee38a22-a8f9-4553-b4d1-a8e0daa42fbc: '<think>To answer this question, I need
      to determine the relative positions of The Beverly Hills Hotel in California
      and the United States Capitol in Washington, DC.


      Let me think about their geographic locations:


      1. The Beverly Hills Hotel is located in Beverly Hills, California, which is
      on the West Coast of the United States.


      2. The United States Capitol is located in Washington, DC, which is on the East
      Coast of the United States.


      In the United States, the West Coast (California, Oregon, Washington state)
      is always west of the East Coast (including Washington, DC). California is significantly
      west of Washington, DC.


      Therefore, The Beverly Hills Hotel in CA is located west of the United States
      Capitol in DC.</think>I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both buildings.

      - The Beverly Hills Hotel is located in Beverly Hills, California

      - The United States Capitol is located in Washington, DC


      Step 2: Now I''ll consider their positions on the US map.

      - California is on the West Coast of the United States

      - Washington, DC is on the East Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Moving from east to west across the United States, you would go from Washington,
      DC to California

      - Therefore, Beverly Hills (in California) is west of Washington, DC


      Since The Beverly Hills Hotel is in California and the United States Capitol
      is in Washington, DC, and California is west of Washington, DC on the US map:
