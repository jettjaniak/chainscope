      \ of Riyadh, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the\
      \ locations**: Punjab is a region in the northern part of India and Pakistan,\
      \ while Riyadh is the capital city of Saudi Arabia.\n\n2. **Determine the geographical\
      \ coordinates**:\n   - Punjab, India/Pakistan is approximately located at 31.1471\xB0\
      \ N, 75.3412\xB0 E.\n   - Riyadh, Saudi Arabia is approximately located at 24.7136\xB0\
      \ N, 46.6753\xB0 E.\n\n3. **Compare the longitudes**:\n   - The longitude of\
      \ Punjab is 75.3412\xB0 E.\n   - The longitude of Riyadh is 46.6753\xB0 E.\n\
      \n4. **Determine the relative positions**:\n   - Since Punjab's longitude (75.3412\xB0\
      \ E) is greater than Riyadh's longitude (46.6753\xB0 E), Punjab is located east\
      \ of Riyadh.\n\nTherefore, considering the geographical positions, the answer\
      \ is: **YES**"
