      \ let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the locations**: Inner\
      \ London refers to the central part of London, the capital city of the United\
      \ Kingdom. The Upper East Side is a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan\
      \ in New York City, USA.\n\n2. **Determine the geographical positions**: London\
      \ is located in the southern part of England, on the River Thames. The Upper\
      \ East Side is located on the eastern side of Manhattan Island, which is in\
      \ New York City.\n\n3. **Compare the longitudes**: To determine if Inner London\
      \ is located east of the Upper East Side, we need to compare their longitudes.\
      \ London's longitude is approximately 0\xB0 8' W (or -0.1333\xB0), while the\
      \ Upper East Side's longitude is approximately 73\xB0 57' W (or -73.95\xB0).\n\
      \n4. **Analyze the comparison**: Since both locations are in the Western Hemisphere\
      \ (west of the Prime Meridian), we can compare their longitudes directly. The\
      \ larger the negative number, the further west the location is. Since -73.95\xB0\
      \ is a larger negative number than -0.1333\xB0, the Upper East Side is located\
      \ further west than Inner London.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison\
      \ of their longitudes, we can conclude that Inner London is **NOT** located\
      \ east of the Upper East Side. Instead, the Upper East Side is located east\
      \ of Inner London.\n\nThe answer is: **NO**"
