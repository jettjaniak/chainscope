      1. First, let''s locate both places:

      - Fukushima Prefecture is in eastern Japan

      - Ho Chi Minh City is in southern Vietnam


      2. Let''s consider their positions on a map:

      - Japan is east of Vietnam

      - Fukushima is on the eastern side of Japan

      - Ho Chi Minh City is on the southern end of Vietnam


      3. Looking at their relative positions:

      - Since Japan as a whole is already east of Vietnam

      - And Fukushima is on Japan''s eastern coast

      - Therefore Fukushima must be east of any point in Vietnam, including Ho Chi
      Minh City
