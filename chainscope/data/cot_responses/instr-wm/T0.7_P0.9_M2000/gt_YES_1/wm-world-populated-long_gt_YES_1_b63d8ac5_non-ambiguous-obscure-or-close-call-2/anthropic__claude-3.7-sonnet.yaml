      Step 1: Identify the locations. Transylvania is a historical region located
      in central Romania in Eastern Europe. Greater Boston is a metropolitan area
      in Massachusetts on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a global map. Moving east from
      the United States, you cross the Atlantic Ocean to reach Europe.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions. Romania (including Transylvania)
      is at approximately 23-26 degrees east longitude. Greater Boston is at approximately
      71 degrees west longitude.


      Step 4: Determine if Transylvania is east of Greater Boston. When moving from
      Boston toward the east, you would eventually reach Transylvania after crossing
      the Atlantic, so Transylvania is indeed east of Greater Boston on a global map.


      YES, Transylvania is located east of Greater Boston.'

      Nile (state) and Coney Island, and then compare their positions to determine
      if River Nile is east of Coney Island.


      Step 1: Identify River Nile (state).

      River Nile is a state in Sudan, located in northeastern Africa.


      Step 2: Identify Coney Island.

      Coney Island is a peninsula and neighborhood in the southwestern part of Brooklyn,
      New York City, USA.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a global map.

      - Sudan (containing River Nile state) is in northeastern Africa

      - New York City (containing Coney Island) is on the eastern coast of North America

      - When looking at a world map, Africa is east of North America


      Step 4: Make the east-west determination.

      Since River Nile state is in Sudan (Africa), and Coney Island is in New York
      (North America), and Africa is east of North America, River Nile state is east
      of Coney Island.


      NO

      YES


      River Nile state is located east of Coney Island.'

      Step 1: First, I need to clarify what "Australia, Cuba" refers to. There is
      no place called "Australia, Cuba." Australia is a country/continent in the southern
      hemisphere, and Cuba is a country in the Caribbean. These are separate places.
      The question might be referring to either Australia or Cuba, or there might
      be confusion in the question.


      Step 2: Let''s consider the locations of both places relative to San Antonio
      (which is in Texas, USA):

      - Cuba is located in the Caribbean, southeast of the United States. Relative
      to San Antonio, Texas, Cuba is east.

      - Australia is located in the southern hemisphere, across the Pacific Ocean
      from the Americas. From San Antonio, you would need to travel west across the
      Pacific to reach Australia (or east for a longer route).


      Step 3: Since there''s ambiguity in the question, I''ll address both interpretations:

      - If asking about Cuba: Yes, Cuba is east of San Antonio

      - If asking about Australia: No, Australia is primarily west of San Antonio
      (though you could reach it by traveling east, but that''s the longer route)


      Since the question appears to be treating "Australia, Cuba" as a single location
      (which doesn''t exist), I cannot give a definitive YES/NO answer without clarification
      of which place is being referenced.'

      Step 2: I need to determine if there is a place called "Australia" in Cuba.

      There are localities in Cuba with names like Havana, Santiago de Cuba, etc.,
      but no significant place called "Australia."


      Step 3: Even if we assume there is some small locality called "Australia" in
      Cuba, I need to determine if it would be east of San Antonio (presumably San
      Antonio, Texas).


      Step 4: Cuba as a whole is located southeast of the United States. Any location
      in Cuba would be east of San Antonio, Texas, which is in the south-central United

      NO.

      \ east) than Riyadh, Punjab is located east of Riyadh.\n\nYES, Punjab is located\
      \ east of Riyadh."
    b6d2e0f0-507a-4e3d-867a-3bdf38422dd9: "I need to determine if Punjab is located\
      \ east of Riyadh by identifying their relative positions.\n\nStep 1: Identify\
      \ the locations.\n- Riyadh is the capital city of Saudi Arabia, located in the\
      \ central part of the Arabian Peninsula in the Middle East.\n- Punjab is a region\
      \ that spans across parts of eastern Pakistan and northern India.\n\nStep 2:\
      \ Compare their longitudinal positions.\n- Riyadh is located at approximately\
      \ 46-47\xB0 East longitude.\n- Punjab (both Indian and Pakistani portions) is\
      \ located at approximately 72-77\xB0 East longitude.\n\nStep 3: Determine relative\
      \ position.\n- Since Punjab's longitude (72-77\xB0E) is greater than Riyadh's\
      \ longitude (46-47\xB0E), Punjab is located further east than Riyadh.\n- On\
      \ a map, Punjab would be to the right (east) of Riyadh.\n\nYES, Punjab is located\
      \ east of Riyadh."
