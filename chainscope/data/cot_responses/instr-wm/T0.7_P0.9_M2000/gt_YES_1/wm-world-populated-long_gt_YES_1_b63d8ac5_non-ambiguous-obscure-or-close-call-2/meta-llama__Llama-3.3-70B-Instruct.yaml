      \ longitudes to determine east-west positioning**:\n   - Since Holland's longitude\
      \ ranges from 3\xB0E to 7.5\xB0E, it is clearly west of the prime meridian.\n\

      \ when considering its position in the global context (since moving west from\
      \ the prime meridian eventually circles back around to the east side of the\
      \ globe).\n   \n4. **Conclusion**: Given that Easter Island is at a longitude\
      \ of 109\xB0W (which places it far to the west of the prime meridian but would\
      \ be considered in the eastern hemisphere if we add 360\xB0 to its negative\
      \ longitude, making it 251\xB0E), and Holland is between 3\xB0E to 7.5\xB0E,\
      \ Holland is west of Easter Island in terms of geographical longitude. However,\
      \ considering the global context and how longitudes wrap around the globe, the\
      \ question essentially asks if Holland is east of Easter Island. Given Easter\
      \ Island's position is more westward when considering standard negative longitude\
      \ values, but actually in the eastern part of the globe when adding 360\xB0\
      \ to its negative longitude for a full-circle perspective, the question's premise\
      \ may seem confusing. \n\nHowever, simplifying: If we consider \"east\" in the\
      \ context of moving around the globe from Holland towards Easter Island, we\
      \ move west to reach Easter Island from Holland. Thus, considering standard\
      \ geographical directions without adding extra steps for a full-circle perspective,\
      \ Holland is not east of Easter Island; it's the other way around when considering\
      \ direct geographical movement.\n\nThe final answer is: NO"

      1. **Identify Verona''s Location**: Verona is a city in Italy, which is in Southern
      Europe. Italy is generally considered to be in the Eastern Hemisphere but is
      west of the Asian continent.


      2. **Identify South Beach''s Location**: South Beach is known to be a part of
      Miami Beach, Florida, in the United States. The United States, particularly
      Florida, is located in North America, which is west of Europe.


      Given these locations:

      - Verona, Italy, is in Europe.

      - South Beach, Florida, is in North America, specifically in the southeastern
      United States.


      Considering the general geography:

      - Europe (where Verona is located) is east of North America (where South Beach

      prime meridian in Greenwich, London. Places east of the prime meridian have
      positive longitudes, and places west have negative longitudes.

      \ east-west relationship**: \n   - Since both locations are west of the Prime\
      \ Meridian, we compare their absolute longitudes (how far west they are). Tenerife\
      \ is approximately 16\xB0 to 17\xB0 west, while San Diego County is about 116\xB0\

      \ in the Caribbean Sea. It is southeast of the southernmost part of Florida,\
      \ U.S.A. Therefore, from San Antonio, Cuba would be eastward and slightly southeast.\n\
      \n3. **Consider the Specific Question**: The question asks if both Australia\

    bee96ee8-602e-4f5b-ad01-2795c1eea2de: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the geographical location of Fukushima Prefecture in relation to Ho Chi Minh
      City.


      1. **Identify Locations**: Fukushima Prefecture is located in Japan, on the
      eastern coast of Honshu, the largest island of Japan. Ho Chi Minh City is located
      in Vietnam, in Southeast Asia.


      2. **General Geographic Orientation**: Japan is generally east of Vietnam. This
      is because Japan is an island country located in East Asia, and Vietnam is a
      country in Southeast Asia, to the west of Japan.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Fukushima Prefecture is on the eastern side of Japan,
      which faces the Pacific Ocean. Ho Chi Minh City is in southern Vietnam, also
      near the coast but facing the South China Sea.


      4. **Comparison**: Given that Japan is east of Vietnam, and considering the
      specific locations within these countries, Fukushima Prefecture, being in eastern
      Japan, would indeed be east of Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Fukushima Prefecture is located
      east of Ho Chi Minh City is: **YES**.'

      E longitude.\n   - Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, is located at approximately 24\xB0\
      N latitude and 46\xB0E longitude.\n\n3. **Compare the longitudes to determine\
      \ east-west positioning**: Since longitude measures east-west position, with\
      \ higher numbers indicating locations further to the east, we compare the longitudes.\n\
      \   - Punjab's longitude ranges from 73\xB0E to 76\xB0E.\n   - Riyadh's longitude\
      \ is approximately 46\xB0E.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that Punjab's longitude\

      \ of Riyadh, we need to consider the geographical locations of both Punjab and\
      \ Riyadh.\n\n1. **Identify the locations**: Punjab is a region located in the\
      \ northern part of the Indian subcontinent. It is divided between India (Punjab,\
      \ India) and Pakistan (Punjab, Pakistan). Riyadh, on the other hand, is the\
      \ capital city of Saudi Arabia, located in the Middle East.\n\n2. **Determine\
      \ the geographical positions**:\n   - Punjab, India, is approximately at 31\xB0\

      \ at 24\xB0N latitude and 46\xB0E longitude.\n\n3. **Compare the longitudes\
      \ to determine east-west positioning**: Since longitude increases as you move\
