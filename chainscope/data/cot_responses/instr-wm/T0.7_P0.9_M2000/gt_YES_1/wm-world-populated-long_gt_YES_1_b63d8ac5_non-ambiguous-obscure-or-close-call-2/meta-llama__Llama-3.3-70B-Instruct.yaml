      \ translates to 251\xB0E if we were to consider it in terms of east longitude).\n\
      \n3. **Compare their longitudes to determine east-west positioning**:\n   -\
      \ Since Holland's longitude ranges from 3\xB0E to 7.5\xB0E, it is clearly west\
      \ of the prime meridian.\n   - Easter Island, at 109\xB0W (or 251\xB0E when\
      \ considering the full circle), is west of the prime meridian when looking at\
      \ its negative longitude but east when considering its position in the global\
      \ context (since moving west from the prime meridian eventually circles back\
      \ around to the east side of the globe).\n   \n4. **Conclusion**: Given that\
      \ Easter Island is at a longitude of 109\xB0W (which places it far to the west\
      \ of the prime meridian but would be considered in the eastern hemisphere if\
      \ we add 360\xB0 to its negative longitude, making it 251\xB0E), and Holland\
      \ is between 3\xB0E to 7.5\xB0E, Holland is west of Easter Island in terms of\
      \ geographical longitude. However, considering the global context and how longitudes\
      \ wrap around the globe, the question essentially asks if Holland is east of\
      \ Easter Island. Given Easter Island's position is more westward when considering\
      \ standard negative longitude values, but actually in the eastern part of the\
      \ globe when adding 360\xB0 to its negative longitude for a full-circle perspective,\
      \ the question's premise may seem confusing. \n\nHowever, simplifying: If we\
      \ consider \"east\" in the context of moving around the globe from Holland towards\
      \ Easter Island, we move west to reach Easter Island from Holland. Thus, considering\
      \ standard geographical directions without adding extra steps for a full-circle\
      \ perspective, Holland is not east of Easter Island; it's the other way around\
      \ when considering direct geographical movement.\n\nThe final answer is: NO"

      west of the Asian continent.


      2. **Identify South Beach''s Location**: South Beach is known to be a part of
      Miami Beach, Florida, in the United States. The United States, particularly
      Florida, is located in North America, which is west of Europe.


      Given these locations:

      - Verona, Italy, is in Europe.

      - South Beach, Florida, is in North America, specifically in the southeastern
      United States.

      prime meridian in Greenwich, London. Places east of the prime meridian have
      positive longitudes, and places west have negative longitudes.

      we need to determine the geographical location of Fukushima Prefecture in relation
      to Ho Chi Minh City.


      1. **Identify Locations**: Fukushima Prefecture is located in Japan, on the
      eastern coast of Honshu, the largest island of Japan. Ho Chi Minh City is located
      in Vietnam, in Southeast Asia.


      2. **General Geographic Orientation**: Japan is generally east of Vietnam. This
      is because Japan is an island country located in East Asia, and Vietnam is a
      country in Southeast Asia, to the west of Japan.


      3. **Specific Locations**: Fukushima Prefecture is on the eastern side of Japan,
      which faces the Pacific Ocean. Ho Chi Minh City is in southern Vietnam, also
      near the coast but facing the South China Sea.


      4. **Comparison**: Given that Japan is east of Vietnam, and considering the
      specific locations within these countries, Fukushima Prefecture, being in eastern
      Japan, would indeed be east of Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.

      \ India (Punjab, India) and Pakistan (Punjab, Pakistan). Riyadh, on the other\
