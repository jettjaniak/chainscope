      1. **Locate Holland**: Holland is a region in the Netherlands, which is in Western
      Europe. The Netherlands is situated around 4 to 7 degrees east longitude.


      2. **Locate Easter Island**: Easter Island is a remote island in the southeastern
      Pacific Ocean, part of Chile. It is located at approximately 109 degrees west
      longitude.


      3. **Compare Longitudes**: Easter Island at 109 degrees west is much further
      west than Holland at 4 to 7 degrees east.


      Therefore, Holland is located east of Easter Island.


      The answer is: YES.'

      1. **Australia**: This is a country and continent located in the Southern Hemisphere,

      of the United States, where San Antonio is located.


      2. **Cuba**: This is an island nation in the Caribbean, located south of the
      United States and east of Mexico.


      3. **San Antonio**: This is a city in the state of Texas, USA, located in the

      - **Cuba** is located to the southeast of San Antonio but still west of Australia.

      - **Australia** is indeed east of San Antonio.
