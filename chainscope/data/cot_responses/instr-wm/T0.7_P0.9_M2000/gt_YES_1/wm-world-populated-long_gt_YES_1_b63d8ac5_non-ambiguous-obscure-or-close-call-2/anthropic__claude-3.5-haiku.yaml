      1. First, let''s locate Emirate of Abu Dhabi:

      - Abu Dhabi is located in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)

      - It is situated in the southeastern part of the Arabian Peninsula

      - It is in the Middle East, specifically in the southeast region


      2. Now, let''s locate Tuscany:

      - Tuscany is a region in central Italy

      - It is located in western Italy, bordering the Mediterranean Sea

      - It is in Southern Europe


      3. Comparing their geographical locations:

      - Abu Dhabi is east of Tuscany

      - Abu Dhabi is in the Middle East (east)

      - Tuscany is in Western Europe (west)


      4. Confirming the relative positioning:

      - If you draw a line from Tuscany eastward, you would pass through the Mediterranean
      Sea, then the Middle East, and Abu Dhabi would be on that line, further east


      Therefore, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi is indeed located east of Tuscany.

    e072e722-085e-47bd-ab32-6114c850cbd3: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Giza is a city in Egypt, located in northern Africa

      2. Philadelphia County is located in the eastern United States

      3. To determine east/west relationship, I''ll consider their global positions

      4. Egypt is east of the United States

      5. Specifically, Egypt is significantly east of Pennsylvania

      6. Therefore, Giza is east of Philadelphia County
