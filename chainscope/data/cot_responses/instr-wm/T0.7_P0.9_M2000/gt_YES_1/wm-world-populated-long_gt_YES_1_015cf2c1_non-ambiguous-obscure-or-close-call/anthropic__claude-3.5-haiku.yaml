      1. First, locate Bondi, New South Wales:

      - Bondi is a famous beach suburb of Sydney, Australia

      - It is located on the east coast of Australia

      - Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere


      2. Next, locate Transylvania:

      - Transylvania is a historical region in Romania

      - Romania is in Eastern Europe

      3. Consider their relative positions:

      - Bondi is in the Southern Hemisphere, east of the Prime Meridian

      - Transylvania is in the Northern Hemisphere, also east of the Prime Meridian

      - However, they are on opposite sides of the globe


      4. Determine their geographic relationship:

      - Bondi is thousands of miles west of Transylvania

      - Specifically, Bondi is west of Transylvania, not east

    839d7ac1-9b35-4106-963a-9a0258ca5954: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Fukushima Prefecture is located in Japan, which is in East Asia.


      2. Japan is located in the Pacific Ocean, east of Asia.


      3. Orlando is located in Florida, United States, which is in North America.


      4. To compare their locations, I''ll consider their positions relative to the
