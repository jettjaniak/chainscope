      3. Now, let''s consider their relative positions:

      - Rikers Island is northeast of Manhattan

      - Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital is on the east side of Manhattan


      4. Comparing their east-west positions:

      - Rikers Island is further east than the hospital''s location


      5. Therefore, Rikers Island is indeed east of Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital.


      Answer: YES'
    f0cb9d24-81ec-41c6-b7ab-1b71cf0f15da: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, locate Rikers Island:

      - Rikers Island is located in Queens, in the East River, north of Queens


      2. Next, locate Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital:

      - This hospital is located in Manhattan, specifically on the east side of Manhattan


      3. Consider their relative positions:

      - Rikers Island is northeast of Manhattan

      - Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital is on the east side of Manhattan


      4. Determine east/west positioning:

      - Since Rikers Island is northeast of Manhattan, and the hospital is on the
      east side of Manhattan, Rikers Island would be east of the hospital''s location


      5. Verify the east/west relationship:

      - Yes, Rikers Island is east of Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'

      - This hotel is located on Central Park South (59th Street)

      - It is on the southeastern edge of Central Park

      - Its coordinates are east of Central Park West


      2. Next, locate the Intrepid Sea Air & Space Museum:

      - This museum is located on the west side of Manhattan

      - Specifically, it is at Pier 86 on the Hudson River

      - Its address is around 46th Street and 12th Avenue


      3. Compare their relative east-west positions:

      - The Ritz Carlton is east of Central Park West

      - The Intrepid Museum is far to the west, near the Hudson River

      - This means the Ritz Carlton is definitively east of the Intrepid Museum

    9223f5f6-78de-4835-beb6-4f42e1b4bff3: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s identify the locations:

      - Riker''s Island is actually located in Queens, not the Bronx

      - Trump International Hotel is in Manhattan, specifically on Columbus Circle


      2. Let''s consider their geographical positions:

      - Riker''s Island is northeast of Manhattan

      - Trump International Hotel is in central Manhattan


      3. To determine if Riker''s Island is east of the Trump Hotel, I''ll mentally
      map their relative positions:

      - Riker''s Island is northeast of Manhattan

      - The Trump Hotel is on the west side of Manhattan

      - Northeast is technically east of west


      4. Therefore, Riker''s Island IS located east of Trump International Hotel.

      - "East of" means to the right/eastern side when looking at a map


      4. Comparing their positions:

      - Since Riker''s Island is northeast of Manhattan, and the hotel is on the west
      side of Manhattan, Riker''s Island IS east of the hotel''s location


      5. Final reasoning:

      - The question is asking if Riker''s Island is east of Trump International Hotel

      - Based on geographic positioning, this is true

      - Both Central Park West Area B and the New Amsterdam Theatre are on the west
      side of Manhattan

      - Central Park West is further north (uptown) compared to the New Amsterdam
      Theatre

      - Central Park West is located west of the New Amsterdam Theatre, not east


      4. Therefore, the answer to "Is Central Park West Area B, Manhattan located
      east of NEW AMSTERDAM THEATRE, Manhattan?" is:


      NO'

      - Rikers Island is northeast of Manhattan

      - The Trump Building is in southern Manhattan

      - Northeast is east and north of the Trump Building''s location


      4. Determine the east/west relationship:

      - Since Rikers Island is northeast of the Trump Building, it is indeed east
      of the Trump Building


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
