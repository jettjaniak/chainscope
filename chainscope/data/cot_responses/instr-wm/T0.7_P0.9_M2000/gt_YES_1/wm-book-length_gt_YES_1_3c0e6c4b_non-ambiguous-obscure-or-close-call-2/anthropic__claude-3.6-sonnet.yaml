      400-450 pages

      - Blink (standard paperback edition) is typically around 280-300 pages


      2. Even accounting for different editions and formats:

      - Fellowship is consistently a much longer book

      - Blink is consistently a shorter book

      - The difference is substantial (over 100 pages)


      3. Therefore, I can confidently say that The Fellowship of the Ring has more
      pages than Blink.
