    0bd938a0-4ea9-4d2f-bd27-c5303d4592f1: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll recall the typical runtime of classic Bollywood movies from
      the 1970s.


      2. Muqaddar Ka Sikandar (1978) is a Prakash Mehra film starring Amitabh Bachchan
      and Rekha.

      - It''s a typical masala film of that era

      - Such films usually ran around 2.5 to 3 hours


      3. Aradhana (1969) is a Shakti Samanta film starring Rajesh Khanna and Sharmila
      Tagore.

      - It''s a romantic drama

      - Films of this type were typically shorter

      - Usually around 2 to 2.5 hours


      4. Comparing the two:

      - Muqaddar Ka Sikandar seems likely to be longer

      - It has more action, more songs, more dramatic plot points


      5. While I can''t state the exact runtime without checking, based on typical
      film lengths and genre characteristics, Muqaddar Ka Sikandar is likely longer.

    9caf7370-fb9a-4385-8b1f-c6c0ab6a93ea: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll look up the runtime of "The Grudge" (2004 American remake directed
      by Takashi Shimizu):

      - Runtime: 91 minutes


      2. Next, I''ll look up the runtime of "Meet the Parents" (2000 directed by Jay
      Roach):

      - Runtime: 108 minutes


      3. Compare the two runtimes:

      - The Grudge: 91 minutes

      - Meet the Parents: 108 minutes


      4. Determine which is longer:

      - Meet the Parents is longer by 17 minutes


      Therefore, the answer is: NO, Takashi Shimizu''s The Grudge is NOT longer than
      Jay Roach''s Meet the Parents.'
