      Let''s assume I have researched and found the following (these are approximate,
      for illustrative purposes):


      * **Bronx:** Population 1.4 million, Area 42 sq mi, Density: 33,333 people/sq
      mi

      * **Portland:** Population 650,000, Area 145 sq mi, Density: 4,483 people/sq

      Brooklyn is a borough of New York City, not a city itself.  We need its population.

      2. **Find the area of Brooklyn:** We need Brooklyn''s land area.

      3. **Calculate Brooklyn''s population density:** Density = Population / Area

      4. **Find the population of Las Vegas:** We need the city''s population.

      5. **Find the area of Las Vegas:** We need the city''s land area.

      6. **Calculate Las Vegas''s population density:** Density = Population / Area

      7. **Compare the two densities:** Determine which is greater.


      After performing these steps (using external resources like Google or Wikipedia),
      one would find Brooklyn has a much higher population density than Las Vegas.
