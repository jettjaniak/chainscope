      answer yet.  I need to perform the calculations.


      Let''s assume I have researched and found the following (these are approximate,
      for illustrative purposes):


      * **Bronx:** Population 1.4 million, Area 42 sq mi, Density: 33,333 people/sq
      mi

      * **Portland:** Population 650,000, Area 145 sq mi, Density: 4,483 people/sq
