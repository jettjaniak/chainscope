      densely populated than Atlanta, GA, we need to consider the population density
      of each city, which is typically measured as the number of people per square
      mile.


      1. **Population of Los Angeles, CA**: Los Angeles is one of the largest cities
      in the United States, with a population of approximately 4 million people.


      2. **Area of Los Angeles, CA**: The city covers an area of about 469 square
      miles.


      3. **Population Density of Los Angeles, CA**: The population density can be
      calculated by dividing the population by the area. For Los Angeles, this results
      in approximately 8,500 people per square mile.


      4. **Population of Atlanta, GA**: Atlanta has a smaller population compared
      to Los Angeles, with approximately 500,000 people.


      5. **Area of Atlanta, GA**: The city covers an area of about 137 square miles.


      6. **Population Density of Atlanta, GA**: The population density can be calculated
      similarly. For Atlanta, this results in approximately 3,650 people per square
      mile.


      Comparing these figures, Los Angeles has a higher population density than Atlanta.


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**, Los Angeles, CA is more densely populated

      population density for an urban area.


      2. **Yosemite Valley, CA**: Yosemite Valley is a well-known location within
      Yosemite National Park. It is primarily a natural area and a popular tourist
      destination. The permanent resident population is very low, as it primarily
      consists of park staff and a few others. The valley itself is about 7.5 square
      miles in size.


      3. **Comparison**: Given that Nashville is a major urban area with a substantial
      population and Yosemite Valley is a natural area with very few permanent residents,
      Nashville is far more densely populated than Yosemite Valley.


      Based on this reasoning, the answer is: **YES**.'
    e6a72ad7-c1e6-4c40-bdc8-f5b67ce52da6: 'To determine whether Nashville, TN is more
      densely populated than Yosemite Valley, CA, we need to consider the population
      density of both locations.


      1. **Understand Population Density**: Population density is typically measured
      as the number of people per square mile or square kilometer.


      2. **Nashville, TN**: Nashville is a major city and the capital of Tennessee.
      As of recent data, Nashville has a significant population and is a relatively
      densely populated urban area.


      3. **Yosemite Valley, CA**: Yosemite Valley is a famous glacial valley in Yosemite
      National Park, California. It is not a city but a natural area with limited
      residential or permanent population. Most of the people present in the valley
      are tourists, and the area is primarily designated for recreational and conservation
      purposes.


      4. **Comparison**: Given that Nashville is a major urban center with a significant
      population living in a relatively compact area, while Yosemite Valley is primarily
      a natural area with a transient tourist population and very few permanent residents,
      Nashville is far more densely populated than Yosemite Valley.


      Based on these considerations, the answer is:


      **YES**'
    edc0c26d-5deb-4c04-b243-d7a7a39dcfcf: 'To determine if Nashville, TN is more densely
      populated than Yosemite Valley, CA, we need to consider the population density
      of each area. Population density is generally calculated as the number of people
      per square mile or square kilometer.


      1. **Nashville, TN**: Nashville is a major city and the capital of Tennessee.
      As of recent estimates, it has a population of over 600,000 people within its
      city limits and covers an area of approximately 475 square miles. This results
      in a population density of roughly 1,263 people per square mile.


      2. **Yosemite Valley, CA**: Yosemite Valley is a part of Yosemite National Park
      in California. It is a popular tourist destination but does not have a significant
      permanent resident population. The area is primarily known for its natural beauty
      and park facilities, not for residential living. The population density is very
      low compared to urban areas.


      By comparing these two areas, it is clear that Nashville, TN, as a major city,
      has a much higher population density than Yosemite Valley, CA, which is a natural
      park area with minimal permanent population.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'
