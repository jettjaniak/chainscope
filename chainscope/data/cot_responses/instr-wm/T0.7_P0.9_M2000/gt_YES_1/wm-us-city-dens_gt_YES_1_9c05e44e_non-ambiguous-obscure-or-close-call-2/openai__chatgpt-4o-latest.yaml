      step.


      Step 1: Understand what "more densely populated" means.

      - Population density is typically measured as the number of people per square
      mile (or per square kilometer).

      - So, we need to compare the population density (not total population) of Santa
      Monica, CA and San Antonio, TX.


      Step 2: Consider the characteristics of each city.


      Santa Monica, CA:

      - A small city located on the coast of Los Angeles County.

      - Known for being quite urbanized and compact.

      - Area: Approximately 8.4 square miles.

      - Population: Roughly 90,000.

      - Population density: About 10,700 people per square mile.


      San Antonio, TX:

      - A large city in Texas, one of the most populous in the US.

      - Area: Over 500 square miles.

      - Population: Over 1.4 million.

      - Population density: About 3,000 people per square mile.


      Step 3: Compare the densities.

      - Santa Monica: ~10,700 people/sq mi

      - San Antonio: ~3,000 people/sq mi


      Conclusion:

      - Santa Monica is significantly more densely populated than San Antonio.

      \ densely populated than Yosemite Valley, CA, let's break this down step by\
      \ step:\n\n1. **Understand what population density means**: \n   Population\
      \ density is typically measured as the number of people per square mile (or\
      \ per square kilometer). So, to compare two places, we need to know both their\
      \ populations and their land areas.\n\n2. **Nashville, TN**:\n   - Nashville\

      \ Nashville has a population of approximately 700,000 people.\n   - The city\

    f50fbe08-486e-4a5d-b51f-6dd6871e33e7: 'To determine whether Nashville, TN is more
      densely populated than Yosemite Valley, CA, let''s break this down:


      Step 1: Understand what "population density" means.

      - Population density is typically measured as the number of people per square
      mile or square kilometer.


      Step 2: Identify the population density of Nashville, TN.

      - Nashville is a major city in the United States with a significant urban population.

      - According to recent data, Nashville has a population density of around 1,400
      to 1,500 people per square mile, depending on the specific area measured.


      Step 3: Consider the population density of Yosemite Valley, CA.

      - Yosemite Valley is a region within Yosemite National Park.

      - It is primarily a natural area, not a residential city or town.

      - While people visit and work in the valley, especially in peak tourist seasons,
      the number of permanent residents is extremely low.

      - The land area is large compared to the small number of residents, resulting
      in a very low population density.


      Step 4: Compare the two.

      - Nashville has a high population density as a city.

      - Yosemite Valley has a very low population density due to its nature as a national
      park area.


      Final conclusion: Nashville, TN is much more densely populated than Yosemite
      Valley, CA.
