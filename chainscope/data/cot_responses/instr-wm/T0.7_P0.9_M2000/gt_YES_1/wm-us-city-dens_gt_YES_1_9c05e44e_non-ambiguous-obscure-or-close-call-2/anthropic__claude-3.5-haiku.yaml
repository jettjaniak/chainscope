      - Orlando''s population is around 307,000

      - Orlando''s land area is about 110.7 square miles

      - This gives Orlando a population density of approximately 2,775 people per

      1. Nashville, TN is a major city with urban development and a significant population.


      2. Yosemite Valley, CA is a natural valley located within Yosemite National

      3. Population density is calculated by dividing the total population by the

    77cec89a-8c40-4557-8db5-27b26bcf9ead: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Nashville, TN is a major city with urban development and a significant population.


      2. Yosemite Valley, CA is a specific valley within Yosemite National Park, which
      is primarily a natural landscape.


      3. Yosemite Valley is a relatively small geographic area, primarily used for
      tourism, camping, and natural preservation.


      4. Nashville has a population of around 689,000 people (as of 2021) spread across
      its urban area.


      5. Yosemite Valley, by contrast, has very limited permanent residents - mostly
      park staff and seasonal workers.


      6. Population density is calculated by people per square mile/kilometer.


      7. Nashville''s urban density is substantial, with many residential and commercial
      buildings.


      8. Yosemite Valley has extremely low population density, with most land being
      open space, hiking trails, and natural features.


      9. Therefore, Nashville is significantly more densely populated than Yosemite
      Valley.


      Answer: YES, Nashville, TN is more densely populated than Yosemite Valley, CA.'
