      Andrew Adamson''s direction means we''re looking at either "The Lion, the Witch,
      and the Wardrobe" or "Prince Caspian" or both combined) and "Aradhana".


      2. **Specify which Narnia film(s):**  The question doesn''t clarify if it refers
      to just one film or both of Adamson''s Narnia films. We must consider both scenarios.


      3. **Find runtimes:** Research the runtimes of the relevant films.  "The Lion,
      the Witch, and the Wardrobe" is approximately 143 minutes. "Prince Caspian"
      is approximately 150 minutes. "Aradhana" is approximately 175 minutes.

      7. **Interpret the question:** Since the question doesn''t specify which Narnia
      film or if it means both combined, assuming the question refers to individual
      films, the answer is no. If we assume the question means the combined runtime
      of both Narnia films by Adamson, then it''s longer than Aradhana. However, the
      most likely interpretation is that the question refers to a single film comparison.

    84a123b8-3292-4ec1-8c37-b95f9ec503f6: '1. **Identify the movies:**
      We need to confirm the full titles of the movies in question to avoid confusion
      with sequels or other films by the same directors.  We''re looking for *Fifty
      Shades of Grey* and *Meet the Parents*.


      2. **Find their runtimes:**  We need to look up the official runtime (or a reliable
      source for it) for each film.


      3. **Compare the runtimes:** Once we have both runtimes, we can determine which
      movie is longer.


      4. **Answer the question:** Based on the comparison, we can answer YES or NO.


      *Fifty Shades of Grey* has a runtime of approximately 125 minutes. *Meet the
      Parents* has a runtime of approximately 108 minutes.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.
