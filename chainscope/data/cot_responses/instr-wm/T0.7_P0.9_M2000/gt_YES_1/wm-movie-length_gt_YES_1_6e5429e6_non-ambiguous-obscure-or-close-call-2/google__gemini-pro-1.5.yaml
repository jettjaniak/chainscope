      We need to find the total runtime for both "The Chronicles of Narnia" (specifying
      Andrew Adamson''s direction means we''re looking at either "The Lion, the Witch,
      and the Wardrobe" or "Prince Caspian" or both combined) and "Aradhana".


      2. **Specify which Narnia film(s):**  The question doesn''t clarify if it refers
      to just one film or both of Adamson''s Narnia films. We must consider both scenarios.


      3. **Find runtimes:** Research the runtimes of the relevant films.  "The Lion,
      the Witch, and the Wardrobe" is approximately 143 minutes. "Prince Caspian"
      is approximately 150 minutes. "Aradhana" is approximately 175 minutes.

      7. **Interpret the question:** Since the question doesn''t specify which Narnia
      film or if it means both combined, assuming the question refers to individual
      films, the answer is no. If we assume the question means the combined runtime
      of both Narnia films by Adamson, then it''s longer than Aradhana. However, the
      most likely interpretation is that the question refers to a single film comparison.

    fa446099-a506-4379-9181-4643fcb55217: '<think></think>1. **Determine the number
      of films in each series:** Hera Pheri has 3 films (Hera Pheri, Phir Hera Pheri,
      Hera Pheri 3). Anchorman has 2 films (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,
      Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues).


      2. **The question is about the *length* of the series.**  While Hera Pheri has
      more films, the question isn''t about the number of films. It''s about the total
      runtime.  We need to consider the runtime of each film in each series.


      3. **We don''t have the exact runtimes readily available without looking them
      up.** However, we can reasonably assume that three Bollywood films, which tend
      to be longer, will likely have a longer combined runtime than two Hollywood
      comedies.


      4. **Therefore, it''s highly probable that the Hera Pheri series has a longer
      total runtime.**

      We need to confirm the full titles of the movies in question to avoid confusion
      with sequels or other films by the same directors.  We''re looking for *Fifty
      Shades of Grey* and *Meet the Parents*.


      2. **Find their runtimes:**  We need to look up the official runtime (or a reliable
      source for it) for each film.


      3. **Compare the runtimes:** Once we have both runtimes, we can determine which
      movie is longer.


      4. **Answer the question:** Based on the comparison, we can answer YES or NO.


      *Fifty Shades of Grey* has a runtime of approximately 125 minutes. *Meet the
      Parents* has a runtime of approximately 108 minutes.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.
