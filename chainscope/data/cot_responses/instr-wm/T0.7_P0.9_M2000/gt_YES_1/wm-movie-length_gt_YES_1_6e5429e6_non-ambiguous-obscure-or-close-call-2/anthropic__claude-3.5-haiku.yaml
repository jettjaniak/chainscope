      1. First, I''ll consider the length of Peter Jackson''s The Hobbit trilogy:

      - The Hobbit was originally a single book, but Jackson made it into three films

      - The three films are: An Unexpected Journey, The Desolation of Smaug, and The
      Battle of the Five Armies

      - Total runtime of these three films is approximately 8 hours and 4 minutes


      2. Next, I''ll consider David Yates''s Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows:

      - This was split into two films: Part 1 and Part 2

      - Part 1 runtime is about 2 hours and 26 minutes

      - Part 2 runtime is about 2 hours and 10 minutes

      - Total runtime of both Deathly Hallows films is approximately 4 hours and 36
      minutes


      3. Comparing the total runtimes:

      - The Hobbit trilogy: ~8 hours and 4 minutes

      - Deathly Hallows: ~4 hours and 36 minutes
