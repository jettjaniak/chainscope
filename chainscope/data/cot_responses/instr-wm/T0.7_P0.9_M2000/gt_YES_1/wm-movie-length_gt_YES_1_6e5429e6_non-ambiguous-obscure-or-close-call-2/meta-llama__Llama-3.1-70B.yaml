      we need to determine the runtime of both movies and compare them.


      1. First, let''s find the runtime of Ramesh Sippy''s Seeta Aur Geeta. Seeta
      Aur Geeta is a 1972 Indian Hindi-language film, and its runtime is approximately
      166 minutes (2 hours 46 minutes).


      2. Next, let''s find the runtime of Oliver Stone''s Wall Street. Wall Street
      is a 1987 American film, and its runtime is approximately 126 minutes (2 hours
      6 minutes).


      3. Now, compare the runtime of both movies. Seeta Aur Geeta has a runtime of
      166 minutes, while Wall Street has a runtime of 126 minutes.

      \ \n   - James Foley's \"Fifty Shades\" is a series of films based on the novel\
      \ by E. L. James. The three films in the series are \"Fifty Shades of Grey\"\
      \ (2015), \"Fifty Shades Darker\" (2017), and \"Fifty Shades Freed\" (2018).\n\
      \   - Kundan Shah's \"Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro\" is a 1983 Indian satirical comedy\
      \ film.\n\n2. **Find the runtime of \"Fifty Shades\" films**:\n   - \"Fifty\
      \ Shades of Grey\" (2015) has a runtime of 125 minutes (2 hours 5 minutes).\n\
      \   - \"Fifty Shades Darker\" (2017) has a runtime of 118 minutes (1 hour 58\
