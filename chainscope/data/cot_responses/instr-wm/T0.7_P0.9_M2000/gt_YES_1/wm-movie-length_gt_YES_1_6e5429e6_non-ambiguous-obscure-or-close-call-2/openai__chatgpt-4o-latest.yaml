      to determine whether the Hera Pheri series by Priyadarshan is longer than the
      Anchorman series by Adam McKay.


      **Step 1: Identify the number of movies in the Hera Pheri series.**


      - The Hera Pheri series is an Indian comedy film series.

      - The first film, *Hera Pheri*, was released in 2000 and directed by Priyadarshan.

      - The second film, *Phir Hera Pheri*, was released in 2006, directed by Neeraj
      Vora.

      - A third film, tentatively titled *Hera Pheri 3*, has been in development for
      years, but as of the latest available information, it has not been officially
      released.


      So currently, the Hera Pheri series has 2 released films.


      **Step 2: Identify the number of movies in the Anchorman series.**


      - The Anchorman series is an American comedy series directed by Adam McKay.

      - The first film, *Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy*, was released in 2004.

      - The second film, *Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues*, was released in 2013.


      So the Anchorman series also has 2 films.


      **Step 3: Compare the number of films in each series.**


      - Hera Pheri: 2 films released.

      - Anchorman: 2 films released.


      **Conclusion:**

      Both series currently have 2 films released. Therefore, the Hera Pheri series
      is not longer than the Anchorman series.
