      1) First, I need to identify the running times of both films.


      2) "Seeta Aur Geeta" is a 1972 Bollywood film directed by Ramesh Sippy. Its
      running time is approximately 162 minutes (2 hours and 42 minutes).


      3) "Wall Street" is a 1987 American film directed by Oliver Stone. Its running
      time is approximately 126 minutes (2 hours and 6 minutes).


      4) Comparing the two: 162 minutes > 126 minutes


      5) Therefore, Ramesh Sippy''s "Seeta Aur Geeta" (162 minutes) is longer than
      Oliver Stone''s "Wall Street" (126 minutes).

      determine whether Anurag Kashyap''s "Gangs of Wasseypur" is longer than Chandra
      Barot''s "Don".


      Step 1: Identify the films and their runtimes.

      - "Gangs of Wasseypur" is a film directed by Anurag Kashyap. It''s actually
      a two-part film, with Part 1 running approximately 160 minutes (2 hours and
      40 minutes) and Part 2 running approximately 159 minutes (2 hours and 39 minutes).
      Combined, the full saga runs about 319 minutes (5 hours and 19 minutes).


      Step 2: Identify the runtime of "Don".

      - "Don" (1978) directed by Chandra Barot starring Amitabh Bachchan has a runtime
      of approximately 175 minutes (2 hours and 55 minutes).


      Step 3: Compare the runtimes.

      - "Gangs of Wasseypur" (combined): 319 minutes

      - "Don": 175 minutes

      - 319 minutes is greater than 175 minutes

      "Gangs of Wasseypur" was released as a two-part film. Part 1 has a runtime of
      approximately 160 minutes (2 hours and 40 minutes), and Part 2 has a runtime
      of approximately 159 minutes (2 hours and 39 minutes). If considered as a complete

      The 1978 film "Don" directed by Chandra Barot has a runtime of approximately
      175 minutes (2 hours and 55 minutes).
