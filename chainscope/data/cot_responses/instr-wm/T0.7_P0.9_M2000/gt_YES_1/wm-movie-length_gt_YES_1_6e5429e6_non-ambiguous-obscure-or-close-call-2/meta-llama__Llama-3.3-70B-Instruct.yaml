      145 minutes.

      4. Find the runtime of "Aradhana" (1969). According to various sources, its
      runtime is approximately 169 minutes (though this can slightly vary depending
      on the version or cut of the film).


      Comparing the runtime:

      - "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" (2005) is
      approximately 145 minutes long.

      - "Aradhana" (1969) is approximately 169 minutes long.

      \   - The Hera Pheri series, if only considering the mentioned titles, has at\
