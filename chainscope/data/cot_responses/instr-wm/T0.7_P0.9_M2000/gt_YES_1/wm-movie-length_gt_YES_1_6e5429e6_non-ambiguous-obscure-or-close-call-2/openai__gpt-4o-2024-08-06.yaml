      Shades" is longer than Kundan Shah''s "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro," we need to look
      at the runtime of each film.


      1. **Fifty Shades (2015)**: Directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, not James Foley.
      However, assuming you mean "Fifty Shades Darker" (2017) directed by James Foley,
      its runtime is approximately 118 minutes.


      2. **Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro (1983)**: Directed by Kundan Shah, its runtime is approximately
      132 minutes.


      Now, compare the two runtimes:


      - "Fifty Shades Darker" (2017) is 118 minutes long.

      - "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro" (1983) is 132 minutes long.
