    9f8e8d38-1dcc-4091-90cd-8cbb6bf230eb: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s locate the Persian Gulf:

      - The Persian Gulf is located in the Middle East

      - It is situated between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula

      - It is in the southwestern part of Asia


      2. Now, let''s locate the Great Lakes:

      - The Great Lakes are located in North America

      - They are situated between the United States and Canada

      - They are in the northeastern part of North America


      3. Consider their geographical relationship:

      - The Persian Gulf is in Asia

      - The Great Lakes are in North America

      - These regions are on different continents


      4. Determine the directional relationship:

      - The Persian Gulf is southwest of the Great Lakes

      - It is not east of the Great Lakes


      5. Therefore, the statement is FALSE.
