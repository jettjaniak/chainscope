      1. First, let''s consider the geographic locations of Denver County, CO and
      Sacramento County, CA.


      2. Denver County is located in Colorado, which is in the central part of the
      United States.


      3. Sacramento County is located in California, which is on the west coast of
      the United States.


      4. To determine their relative east-west positioning, I''ll mentally map their
      locations.


      5. Colorado is east of California. So any county in Colorado will be east of
      any county in California.


      6. Therefore, Denver County is indeed east of Sacramento County.


      The answer is: YES.'
