      \ The user wants to know if New York University's Graduate School of Arts and\
      \ Science (NYU GSAS) in New York is located north of Johns Hopkins University\
      \ (JHU) in Maryland. Hmm, I need to figure out the geographic locations of both\
      \ universities and compare their latitudes.\n\nFirst, I should confirm where\
      \ each university is situated. Let's start with NYU GSAS. NYU's main campus\
      \ is in New York City, specifically in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. The Graduate\
      \ School of Arts and Science is part of that main campus. So the address would\
      \ be in New York, NY.\n\nNext, Johns Hopkins University's main campus is in\
      \ Baltimore, Maryland. I know JHU has multiple campuses, but the primary one\
      \ is in Baltimore. The user specifically mentioned MD (Maryland), so that's\
      \ the one we're looking at.\n\nNow, to determine which is further north, I need\
      \ the latitudes of both cities. New York City's latitude is approximately 40.7128\xB0\
      \ N, and Baltimore's latitude is around 39.2904\xB0 N. Since latitude increases\
      \ as you go north, a higher number means a more northern location. Comparing\
      \ the two, 40.7128\xB0 N (NYC) is indeed higher than 39.2904\xB0 N (Baltimore).\
      \ Therefore, New York City is north of Baltimore. \n\nSince NYU GSAS is in NYC\
      \ and JHU is in Baltimore, the answer should be yes. But wait, let me double-check.\
      \ Sometimes people might confuse campuses, like if JHU has a campus in a different\
      \ city. But the question specifies Johns Hopkins University, MD, which is definitely\
      \ Baltimore. And NYU's main campus is in NYC. So the latitudes confirm NYC is\
      \ north of Baltimore. Therefore, NYU GSAS is north of JHU.\n</think>YES  \n\

      \ 40.729\xB0 N latitude.  \n2. **Locate Johns Hopkins University (MD):** Its\
      \ main campus is in Baltimore, MD, at approximately 39.290\xB0 N latitude. \
      \ \n3. **Compare Latitudes:** Since 40.729\xB0 N (NYU) is greater than 39.290\xB0\
      \ N (JHU), NYU GSAS is north of Johns Hopkins University.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"

    10b58182-5cc0-4507-aef2-979f3afac76d: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Syracuse University in New York is located north of the University of California,\
      \ San Francisco (UCSF) in California. Let's start by recalling some basic geography.\
      \ \n\nFirst, I know that Syracuse University is in Syracuse, New York. UCSF\
      \ is in San Francisco, California. The question is about their relative latitudes.\
      \ If I can determine the latitude of both cities, I can compare them. Latitude\
      \ measures how far north or south a place is from the equator. The higher the\
      \ latitude, the farther north it is.\n\nI remember that New York State is in\
      \ the northeastern part of the US, while California is on the west coast. However,\
      \ California is a large state, so San Francisco is in Northern California. But\
      \ compared to New York State, which is further east and north, I'm not sure.\
      \ \n\nSyracuse, NY: Let me think. New York City is around 40.7 degrees north\
      \ latitude. Syracuse is upstate, so it's probably a bit north of NYC. Maybe\
      \ around 43 degrees? \n\nSan Francisco, CA: San Francisco is in Northern California.\
      \ I think its latitude is somewhere around 37.7 degrees north. For example,\
      \ I recall that Los Angeles is around 34 degrees, and San Francisco is further\
      \ north. \n\nSo if Syracuse is around 43\xB0N and San Francisco is around 37.7\xB0\
      N, then Syracuse is indeed north of San Francisco. Therefore, Syracuse University\
      \ would be north of UCSF. Let me verify these latitude numbers to be sure. \n\
      \nQuick check: Syracuse, NY's latitude. According to my memory, yes, Syracuse\
      \ is around 43.0\xB0N. And San Francisco is approximately 37.7749\xB0N. So yes,\
      \ 43 is higher than 37.7, which means Syracuse is further north.\n</think>To\
      \ determine if Syracuse University, NY is north of UC San Francisco, CA:  \n\
      1. **Syracuse, NY** latitude: Approximately **43.0\xB0N**.  \n2. **San Francisco,\
      \ CA** latitude: Approximately **37.7749\xB0N**.  \nSince 43.0\xB0N > 37.7749\xB0\
      N, Syracuse is farther north.  \n\nANSWER: YES"
    10ca7949-fb85-46ec-b3ac-2e31741c38e4: "<think>Alright, so the question is whether\
      \ Syracuse University in New York is located north of the University of California,\
      \ San Francisco (UCSF) in California. Let me try to figure this out step by\
      \ step. \n\nFirst, I need to recall where these two universities are situated.\
      \ Syracuse University is in Syracuse, New York. UCSF is in San Francisco, California.\
      \ I know that New York is on the East Coast of the US, and California is on\
      \ the West Coast. But I'm not exactly sure about the latitudes of these two\
      \ cities. Latitude measures how far north or south a place is, so comparing\
      \ their latitudes will give the answer.\n\nLet me start with San Francisco,\
      \ CA. I remember that San Francisco is in Northern California, but how far north\
      \ is that? I think the approximate latitude for San Francisco is around 37 degrees\
      \ North. Maybe 37.7749\xB0 N? That sounds familiar from places like the Golden\
      \ Gate Bridge.\n\nNow, Syracuse, NY. Syracuse is in upstate New York, which\
      \ is more towards the northern part of the state. I'm less certain about its\
      \ exact latitude. Maybe around 43 degrees North? I think cities like Buffalo,\
      \ NY are around 42.8864\xB0 N, and Syracuse is a bit east of there. So maybe\
      \ Syracuse is a bit higher. Let me check in my mind\u2014if I recall correctly,\
      \ Syracuse's latitude is approximately 43.0469\xB0 N.\n\nIf that's accurate,\
      \ then 43 degrees for Syracuse and 37 degrees for San Francisco would mean Syracuse\
      \ is indeed north of UCSF. But wait, maybe I should double-check the exact coordinates.\
      \ Sometimes cities can be surprising. For example, Portland, Oregon is around\
      \ 45.5\xB0 N, which is further north than many places on the East Coast. But\
      \ San Francisco is more south. Let me think again: the southernmost part of\
      \ California is around 32\xB0 N, but San Francisco is in the northern part of\
      \ the state, so 37-38\xB0 N makes sense. \n\nSyracuse, being in upstate New\
      \ York, is definitely north of New York City, which is around 40.7\xB0 N. So\
      \ Syracuse at 43\xB0 would be several degrees north of NYC, which is already\
      \ further north than San Francisco. Therefore, yes, Syracuse University would\
      \ be located north of UCSF. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: the 40th\
      \ parallel north runs through the US. Cities like Philadelphia are around 39.95\xB0\
      \ N, NYC at 40.7\xB0 N. Syracuse is upstate, so higher than NYC. Meanwhile,\
      \ San Francisco at 37.7\xB0 N is below the 40th parallel. So Syracuse is north\
      \ of the 40th, San Francisco south. That confirms it. Therefore, the answer\
      \ should be YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Locations\
      \ Identified:** Syracuse University is in Syracuse, NY (43.0469\xB0 N latitude);\
      \ UCSF is in San Francisco, CA (37.7749\xB0 N latitude).  \n2. **Latitude Comparison:**\
      \ Syracuse (43.05\xB0 N) lies farther north than San Francisco (37.77\xB0 N).\
      \  \n3. **Conclusion:** Since higher latitude means farther north, Syracuse\
      \ University is indeed north of UCSF.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"

      \ the latitudes of both places to compare them. \n\nFirst, I know that Syracuse\
      \ University is in Syracuse, New York. New York State is on the East Coast,\
      \ and Syracuse is in the central part of the state, not too far from the Great\
      \ Lakes. On the other hand, UCSF is in San Francisco, California, which is on\
      \ the West Coast, in Northern California. \n\nI remember that generally, the\
      \ northern parts of the US are states like Washington, Montana, North Dakota,\
      \ etc. But both New York and California are in the lower 48, so maybe their\
      \ latitudes are comparable. Wait, San Francisco is known for being a northern\
      \ city in California, but how does that compare to Syracuse?\n\nLet me think\
      \ about the actual coordinates. Syracuse, NY's latitude is approximately 43.0\xB0\

      N is definitely north of 37.7\xB0N. So Syracuse would be north of San Francisco.\
      \ \n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check those coordinates. Let me recall:\
      \ New York City is around 40.7\xB0 N, so Syracuse being upstate would be a bit\
      \ higher. San Francisco's latitude is indeed in the mid-37s. So yes, Syracuse\

      \ where these universities are. Syracuse University is in Syracuse, New York.\
      \ UCSF is in San Francisco, California. So the key is to find the latitudes\
      \ of Syracuse, NY, and San Francisco, CA.\n\nI know that generally, the further\
      \ north a place is in the US, the higher its latitude. For example, New York\
      \ State is on the East Coast, and California is on the West Coast. But San Francisco\
      \ is in Northern California, which I think is around the same latitude as, say,\
      \ Virginia or maybe even further north? Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The US's\
      \ northern border with Canada is at the 49th parallel, but most of the populous\
      \ areas are lower. New York City is around 40.7\xB0 N latitude. What about Syracuse?\
      \ Since it's in upstate New York, it's probably a bit north of NYC. Maybe around\
      \ 43\xB0 N? Let me verify that. Syracuse, NY's latitude is approximately 43.0469\xB0\
      \ N according to what I remember.\n\nSan Francisco, on the other hand, is known\
      \ for being in a more temperate climate. Its latitude is around 37.7749\xB0\
      \ N. Wait, that's lower than New York City's latitude. So if Syracuse is at\

      \ north. Therefore, Syracuse University would be north of UCSF.\n\nWait, but\
      \ I should make sure I'm not mixing up east and west. Even though Syracuse is\
      \ east, latitude is purely north-south. So as long as Syracuse has a higher\
      \ latitude number than San Francisco, it's further north. Let me double-check\
      \ the exact latitudes.\n\nLooking it up in my mind, Syracuse, NY's coordinates\

      \ Let me think. San Francisco is in Northern California, but I've heard that\

      \ Syracuse University in New York is located north of the University of California,\
      \ San Francisco (UCSF) in California. Hmm, so first, I need to determine the\
      \ geographical locations of both universities, specifically their latitudes,\
      \ because latitude determines how far north or south a place is. \n\nSyracuse\
      \ University is in Syracuse, New York. I know New York is on the east coast\
      \ of the US, and California is on the west coast. San Francisco is in northern\
      \ California, so maybe it's pretty far north. But Syracuse is in upstate New\
      \ York, which I think is more northern than, say, New York City. Let me recall\
      \ the approximate latitudes.\n\nFrom what I remember, San Francisco's latitude\
      \ is around 37 degrees north. That's because cities like Los Angeles are around\
      \ 34 degrees, and San Francisco is a bit north of LA. As for Syracuse, New York,\
      \ I'm not exactly sure, but upstate New York cities like Buffalo are around\

      \ Let me confirm: Syracuse, NY's latitude is approximately 43.05 degrees North.\
      \ UCSF is in San Francisco, CA, which is at about 37.77 degrees North. \n\n\
      So comparing 43.05\xB0N (Syracuse) vs. 37.77\xB0N (San Francisco). Since 43.05\

      \ Maybe I mixed up the coordinates. A quick mental check: The higher the latitude,\

      \ Let me start by recalling where each university is situated.\n\nFirst, Stanford\
      \ University. I think it's in the northern part of California, near San Francisco.\
      \ Maybe Palo Alto? Yeah, I remember hearing that Stanford is in Palo Alto. So\
      \ that's in the Bay Area. Then, UC Santa Barbara. Santa Barbara is a city along\
      \ the southern California coast, right? Like, north of Los Angeles but still\
      \ in the southern half of the state. Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, California's\
      \ geography: the state is long from north to south. The Bay Area, including\
      \ San Francisco and Palo Alto, is in the northern part. Los Angeles is further\
      \ south, and Santa Barbara is a coastal city northwest of LA. So maybe Santa\
      \ Barbara is actually in Central California? But how far north is it compared\
      \ to Stanford?\n\nTo be precise, I should probably look at the latitudes. Latitude\
      \ lines run horizontally, so the higher the latitude number, the further north\
      \ a place is. Let me recall approximate latitudes. San Francisco is around 37\xB0\
      N. Palo Alto, where Stanford is, is slightly south of SF but still in the same\
      \ general area. Wait, actually, San Francisco's latitude is approximately 37.7749\xB0\
      \ N. Palo Alto is about 37.4419\xB0 N. Wait, that would mean Palo Alto is slightly\
      \ south of San Francisco? That seems counterintuitive because Palo Alto is in\
      \ the South Bay area. Hmm, maybe I got that mixed up. Let me check again. Wait,\
      \ San Francisco is at 37.7749\xB0 N, San Jose is around 37.3382\xB0 N (south\
      \ of SF), and Palo Alto is between SF and San Jose. So Palo Alto's latitude\
      \ would be around 37.44\xB0 N, as I saw earlier. Then Santa Barbara's latitude\
      \ is approximately 34.4208\xB0 N. Yes, that's lower than 37\xB0, meaning Santa\
      \ Barbara is further south. Therefore, Stanford (37.44\xB0 N) is north of UCSB\
      \ (34.42\xB0 N). So the answer should be YES.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let\
      \ me make sure I'm not confusing anything. Maybe Santa Barbara is further north\
      \ than I thought? No, Santa Barbara is in Southern California. If UCSB is in\
      \ Santa Barbara, then it's definitely south of the Bay Area. So Stanford, being\

      \ the southern part of the state, maybe around the same latitude as Los Angeles?\
      \ No, Los Angeles is further south. Let me think. Santa Barbara is north of\
      \ LA but south of San Francisco. So San Francisco is around 37\xB0N latitude,\
      \ while Santa Barbara is around 34\xB0N. Palo Alto (Stanford) is about 37.4\xB0\
      N, and Santa Barbara is 34.4\xB0N. So Stanford would be north of UCSB.\n\nAlternatively,\

    e30e361d-347d-493d-8801-7257ea40308b: "<think>Okay, let's see. I need to figure\
      \ out if Stanford University in California is north of the University of California,\
      \ Santa Barbara (UCSB). Hmm, I'm not exactly sure where these two are located,\
      \ so I should probably start by recalling or looking up their general locations.\
      \ \n\nFirst, I know that Stanford is in Northern California. I remember it's\
      \ near Palo Alto, which is part of the Bay Area. The Bay Area includes cities\
      \ like San Francisco and San Jose. So Stanford is definitely in the northern\
      \ part of the state. \n\nOn the other hand, UC Santa Barbara is part of the\
      \ University of California system, and I think it's located in Southern California.\
      \ Santa Barbara is a city along the coast, maybe a couple of hours north of\
      \ Los Angeles? Wait, LA is in Southern California, so if Santa Barbara is north\
      \ of LA, that would still be considered Southern California. But how far north\
      \ exactly?\n\nI should probably think about the approximate latitudes. Latitude\
      \ lines run horizontally, and the higher the latitude, the farther north a place\
      \ is. Let me try to recall the approximate latitudes. San Francisco is around\
      \ 37.7 degrees north. Santa Barbara, if I'm not mistaken, is around 34.4 degrees\
      \ north. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, San Francisco is at about\
      \ 37.7, and Los Angeles is around 34.05. So Santa Barbara would be between them?\
      \ Wait, no, Santa Barbara is actually north of Los Angeles but south of San\
      \ Francisco. Let me check that again. Los Angeles is at approximately 34 degrees,\
      \ Santa Barbara is about 34.4, so actually, Santa Barbara is a bit north of\
      \ LA but still quite south compared to the Bay Area. \n\nWait, but wait. If\
      \ San Francisco is 37.7, and Santa Barbara is around 34.4, then San Francisco\
      \ is definitely north of Santa Barbara. Since Stanford is near San Francisco\
      \ (Palo Alto is around 37.4 latitude), then Stanford would be north of UCSB,\
      \ which is in Santa Barbara. \n\nWait, but maybe I got the latitude numbers\
      \ wrong. Let me try to think of major cities. San Jose is in the Bay Area, and\
      \ its latitude is around 37.3. Santa Barbara is further south, maybe around\
      \ 34.4. So yes, Stanford at 37.4 would be north of UCSB at 34.4. So the answer\
      \ should be yes.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of driving directions. If you\
      \ were to drive from Santa Barbara to Stanford, you'd go north on the 101 freeway,\
      \ passing through places like San Jose, which is in the Bay Area. That would\
      \ mean Stanford is indeed north of UCSB.\n\nAnother way: the University of California\
      \ system has campuses from north to south. UC Berkeley is in the north, then\
      \ UC Davis, then maybe UC Santa Cruz, UC Santa Barbara... Wait, but no, UC Santa\
      \ Cruz is near the Bay Area, so maybe UC Santa Barbara is further south. So\
      \ the order from north to south would be UC Berkeley (north), then maybe UC\
      \ Davis (inland north), then UC Santa Cruz (central coast), then maybe UCLA\
      \ and UCSB. Wait, I'm confusing. Let's list some UC campuses from north to south.\
      \ UC Davis is north of Berkeley? No, Berkeley is on the east side of the Bay,\
      \ Davis is northeast, but latitude-wise, Davis is slightly north of Berkeley.\
      \ Then Santa Cruz is south of the Bay Area. Then there's UC Merced, which is\
      \ in the Central Valley. Then UC Santa Barbara is along the coast south of that.\
      \ Then UCLA and UC Irvine, UCSD in San Diego. So yes, UCSB is south of the Bay\
      \ Area where Stanford is located. Therefore, Stanford would be north of UCSB.\n\
      \nYes, so all these points lead me to conclude that Stanford University is indeed\
      \ located north of University of California, Santa Barbara. The answer is YES.\n\
      </think>To determine if Stanford University, CA is north of UC Santa Barbara,\
      \ CA:  \n1. **Locations**: Stanford is in Palo Alto (Bay Area, Northern California),\
      \ while UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) is in Southern California.  \n2. **Latitudes**:\

      \ state, but compared to Florida, which is also southern, but maybe further\
      \ south?\n\nWait, I remember that Florida is known for being the southernmost\
      \ of the contiguous states, except maybe parts of Texas. For example, the Florida\
      \ Keys are way south. But Florida State University is in Tallahassee, which\
      \ is in the northern part of Florida. That's interesting because Tallahassee\
      \ is close to the border with Georgia. So maybe its latitude isn't as low as,\
      \ say, Miami. \n\nOn the other hand, Arizona State in Tempe. Tempe is near Phoenix,\
      \ which is in central Arizona. So, Phoenix's latitude is around 33 degrees north,\
      \ I believe. Let me confirm that. Phoenix, AZ is at approximately 33.45\xB0\
      \ N latitude. Tallahassee, FL is the capital of Florida where FSU is located.\
      \ Tallahassee's latitude is about 30.45\xB0 N. \n\nWait, if Phoenix is around\
      \ 33.45\xB0N and Tallahassee is 30.45\xB0N, then Phoenix (and thus ASU) is north\
      \ of Tallahassee (FSU). Therefore, the answer would be YES. But wait, let me\

      \ 30.4420\xB0 N. Comparing 33.4255 vs 30.4420. Since 33.4255 is higher than\
      \ 30.4420, that means Tempe, AZ is indeed north of Tallahassee, FL. Therefore,\

      \ California, Nevada, and New Mexico. Florida, on the other hand, is the southeasternmost\
      \ state, sticking out into the Caribbean. \n\nNow, latitude is what determines\
      \ how far north or south a place is. The higher the latitude, the more north\
      \ it is. I should probably check the approximate latitudes of the cities where\
      \ these universities are located. Arizona State University is in Tempe, AZ.\
      \ Florida State is in Tallahassee, FL. \n\nLet me try to remember the approximate\
      \ latitudes. I think Tallahassee is in the northern part of Florida, but Florida\
      \ as a whole is a southern state. Arizona is a bit tricky because even though\
      \ it's in the southwest, parts of it might be more northern than Florida. For\
      \ example, the southern border of Arizona is along Mexico, but Tempe is in the\
      \ central part, maybe around 33 degrees north latitude? \n\nWait, Tallahassee,\
      \ FL's latitude... I'm not exactly sure, but Florida's panhandle where Tallahassee\
      \ is located is around 30 degrees north, maybe a bit higher. Let me think: Miami\
      \ is around 25.7\xB0N, and Jacksonville is around 30.3\xB0N. Tallahassee is\
      \ west of Jacksonville, in the panhandle, so maybe around 30.4\xB0N? \n\nTempe,\
      \ AZ: Phoenix, which is where Tempe is part of the metro area, is around 33.4\xB0\
      N latitude. If that's the case, then 33.4\xB0N is definitely north of 30.4\xB0\
      N. So yes, Arizona State would be north of Florida State. \n\nWait, but I should\
      \ make sure I have the correct cities. Arizona State's main campus is in Tempe,\
      \ which is part of the Phoenix metropolitan area. Florida State is in Tallahassee.\
      \ So checking their exact coordinates:\n\nLooking up mentally, Phoenix, AZ is\
      \ approximately 33.45\xB0N, and Tallahassee, FL is around 30.43\xB0N. Since\
      \ 33.45 is higher than 30.43, that means Tempe is north of Tallahassee. Therefore,\
      \ Arizona State University is indeed located north of Florida State University.\n\
      </think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Identify Locations:** Arizona\
      \ State University (ASU) is in Tempe, AZ; Florida State University (FSU) is\
      \ in Tallahassee, FL.  \n2. **Compare Latitudes:**  \n   - Tempe, AZ latitude:\
      \ ~33.4\xB0N.  \n   - Tallahassee, FL latitude: ~30.4\xB0N.  \n3. **Determine\
      \ North/South Position:** A higher latitude means a more northern location.\
      \  \n4. **Conclusion:** 33.4\xB0N (ASU) > 30.4\xB0N (FSU), so ASU is north of\
      \ FSU.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"

      \ whether Arizona State University in Arizona is north of Florida State University\
      \ in Florida. First, I need to figure out the locations of both universities.\
      \ \n\nArizona State University is in Arizona. I know Arizona is a state in the\
      \ southwestern United States. The main campus is in Tempe, which is part of\
      \ the Phoenix metropolitan area. Florida State University is in Tallahassee,\
      \ Florida. Florida is the southeasternmost state, so I'm guessing it's further\
      \ south.\n\nNow, comparing the latitudes. Latitude measures how far north or\
      \ south a place is. The higher the latitude, the further north. I need to find\
      \ the approximate latitudes of Tempe, AZ, and Tallahassee, FL.\n\nFrom what\
      \ I remember, Florida is a southern state, and its panhandle extends west, but\
      \ Tallahassee is in the northern part of Florida. Arizona is more to the west,\
      \ but in terms of north-south, where does it stand?\n\nPhoenix, AZ is around\
      \ 33 degrees latitude. Let me check if that's right. Yes, Phoenix is approximately\
      \ 33\xB026' N. Tallahassee, FL's latitude is about 30\xB026' N. So 33 degrees\
      \ versus 30 degrees. Since 33 is higher than 30, Tempe (Arizona State) is north\
      \ of Tallahassee (Florida State). Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>Arizona\
      \ State University (ASU) is located in Tempe, Arizona, at approximately 33\xB0\
      26\u2032N latitude. Florida State University (FSU) is in Tallahassee, Florida,\
      \ at around 30\xB026\u2032N latitude. Since 33\xB026\u2032N is farther north\
      \ than 30\xB026\u2032N, **YES**, ASU is located north of FSU."

      \ State University in Arizona is north of Florida State University in Florida.\
      \ First, I need to remember where each state is located in the US. Arizona is\
      \ in the southwestern part of the country, probably near California and New\
      \ Mexico. Florida is the southeasternmost state, a peninsula sticking out into\
      \ the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. \n\nNext, I should think about the general\
      \ latitude of both states. Latitude measures how far north or south a place\
      \ is. The higher the latitude, the farther north. I know that Florida is known\
      \ for being a southern state with a warm climate, while Arizona, though also\
      \ warm, is more in the southwest. \n\nLet me recall the approximate latitudes\
      \ of their capitals or major cities. The capital of Arizona is Phoenix, where\
      \ Arizona State is located. Phoenix's latitude is around 33 degrees north. Tallahassee\
      \ is the capital of Florida and where Florida State University is. Tallahassee's\
      \ latitude is about 30 degrees north. Wait, 30 vs 33... that would mean Phoenix\
      \ is actually a bit north of Tallahassee. But is that correct?\n\nWait, maybe\
      \ I'm mixing up the cities. Let me double-check. Arizona State University's\
      \ main campus is in Tempe, which is part of the Phoenix metropolitan area. So\
      \ Tempe's latitude is roughly the same as Phoenix, around 33\xB026'N. Florida\
      \ State University is in Tallahassee, which is at approximately 30\xB026'N.\
      \ Comparing 33\xB0N to 30\xB0N, 33 is higher, so Tempe, AZ is north of Tallahassee,\
      \ FL. Therefore, Arizona State University would be north of Florida State University.\n\
      \nBut wait, could there be any mistake here? Maybe I got the cities wrong? Let\
      \ me confirm. Yes, ASU's main campus is indeed in Tempe, AZ, and FSU is in Tallahassee,\
      \ FL. So based on their latitudes, the answer should be YES.\n</think>Arizona\
      \ State University's main campus is in Tempe, AZ, at approximately 33\xB026'N\
      \ latitude. Florida State University is in Tallahassee, FL, at approximately\
      \ 30\xB026'N latitude. Since 33\xB0N is farther north than 30\xB0N, **YES**,\
      \ Arizona State University, AZ is located north of Florida State University,\
      \ FL."

      \ latitudes of Ann Arbor, MI, and Athens, GA. Latitude lines run east-west,\
      \ so the higher the latitude, the farther north a place is. Let me recall or\
      \ maybe think of major cities near them to estimate. For example, Detroit, MI\

      \ Athens, GA is northeast of Atlanta, so maybe a bit higher latitude. Let me\

      \ to the east-northeast, but the latitude might be similar. Maybe Athens is\
      \ around 33.95\xB0 N. \n\nWait, let me think again. If Ann Arbor, MI is at approximately\
      \ 42.28\xB0 N, and Athens, GA is around 33.96\xB0 N (I think that's correct),\

      \ so College Station is probably at a lower latitude than Cambridge, MA. \n\n\
      But maybe I should check the exact coordinates to be sure. Let me think. Cambridge,\
      \ MA is near Boston. The latitude of Boston is around 42.36 degrees north. College\
      \ Station, TX, I think, is around 30.6 degrees north latitude. If that's correct,\
      \ then 42.36 is definitely higher than 30.6, so Cambridge (and thus Harvard\
      \ Summer School) is north of College Station (Texas A&M). \n\nWait, let me confirm\
      \ those numbers. Maybe I should recall specific cities. For example, Austin,\
      \ Texas is around 30.27\xB0 N, and Dallas is about 32.78\xB0 N. College Station\
      \ is between Austin and Dallas, so maybe around 30.6\xB0 N. Boston is indeed\
      \ around 42\xB0 N. So yes, Massachusetts is much further north. Therefore, the\

      \ Summer School in Massachusetts is north of Texas A&M University in Texas.\
      \ First, I need to locate both places. Harvard is in Cambridge, MA, right? And\
      \ Texas A&M is in College Station, TX. \n\nSo, I need to compare their latitudes.\
      \ I remember that places farther north have higher latitudes. Let me think about\
      \ the approximate latitudes of these two cities. \n\nCambridge, Massachusetts\
      \ is in the northeastern US. I think Boston, which is near Cambridge, has a\
      \ latitude around 42 degrees north. Maybe Cambridge is similar, maybe 42.3\xB0\
      N or something like that. \n\nCollege Station, Texas is in central Texas. Texas\
      \ is a southern state, so its latitude should be lower. Austin, TX is around\
      \ 30\xB0N, and College Station is a bit northeast of Austin. Wait, but moving\
      \ northeast in Texas might not necessarily mean higher latitude. Let me check\
      \ in my mind. Houston is around 29.7\xB0N, and College Station is north of Houston,\
      \ so maybe around 30.6\xB0N? \n\nIf Cambridge, MA is at about 42\xB0N and College\
      \ Station is around 30.6\xB0N, then 42 is definitely higher than 30.6. So Harvard\
      \ would be north of Texas A&M. \n\nWait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing\
      \ up latitude and longitude. Latitude measures north-south, so higher latitude\
      \ means more north. Yes, so 42\xB0N is further north than 30\xB0N. Therefore,\
      \ Harvard Summer School in MA is indeed north of Texas A&M in TX. So the answer\

      \ around 42 degrees north latitude. College Station, TX is in central Texas,\
      \ which is more southern. Texas as a state is in the southern part of the US,\
      \ so I'm thinking College Station might be around 30 degrees north latitude.\
