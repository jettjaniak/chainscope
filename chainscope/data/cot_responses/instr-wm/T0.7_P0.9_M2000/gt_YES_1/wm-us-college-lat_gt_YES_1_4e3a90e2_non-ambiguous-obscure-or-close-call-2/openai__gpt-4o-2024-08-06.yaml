    512f7361-bff5-45e9-9caf-416b32e2aeef: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the geographical locations of Harvard Summer School in Massachusetts and Texas
      A&M University in Texas, and then compare their latitudes to see which is located
      further north.


      1. **Harvard Summer School, MA**: Harvard University is located in Cambridge,
      Massachusetts. Cambridge is situated at a latitude of approximately 42.37 degrees
      North.


      2. **Texas A&M University, TX**: Texas A&M University is located in College
