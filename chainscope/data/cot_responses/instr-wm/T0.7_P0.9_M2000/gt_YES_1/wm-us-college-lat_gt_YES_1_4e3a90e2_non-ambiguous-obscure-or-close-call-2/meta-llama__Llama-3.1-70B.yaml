    1d750752-f302-429e-9863-eecccdccf700: 'To determine if New York
      University Graduate School of Arts and Science (NYU GSAS) in New York is located
      north of Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, let''s break it down:


      1. **Identify the locations**: NYU GSAS is located in New York City, New York.
      Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.

      2. **Geographical knowledge**: New York City is located in the northeastern
      part of the United States, while Baltimore is in the mid-Atlantic region, slightly
      to the south of New York City.

      3. **Compare latitudes**: Generally, the farther north a location is, the higher
      its latitude. New York City has a higher latitude than Baltimore, indicating
      that New York City is indeed north of Baltimore.

      4. **Conclusion based on city locations**: Since New York City is north of Baltimore,
      any institution within New York City, such as NYU GSAS, would also be north
      of any institution in Baltimore, such as Johns Hopkins University.


      Given these steps, the answer is: YES

      1. **Identify the locations**: Cornell University is located in Ithaca, New
      York, and Columbia University is located in New York City, New York.

      2. **Understand geographical directions**: North is the direction towards the
      North Pole. In the United States, this generally means moving towards Canada.

      3. **Compare locations**: Ithaca, New York, is located north of New York City,
      New York. This is because Ithaca is in central New York State, while New York
      City is in the southeastern part of the state.

      4. **Determine the relationship**: Since Ithaca (where Cornell University is
      located) is north of New York City (where Columbia University is located), Cornell
      University College of Veterinary Medicine is indeed located north of the School
      of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University.


      Therefore, based on the geographical relationship between the two locations,
      the answer is: YES

      1. **Identify the locations**: \n   - UPenn is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\
      \   - Duke University is located in Durham, North Carolina.\n\n2. **Understand\
      \ geographical directions**: \n   - North refers to a direction that is towards\

      University in North Carolina, let''s break it down:


      1. **Identify the locations**: The University of Pennsylvania is located in
      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the Graduate School of Duke University is located
      in Durham, North Carolina.

      2. **Understand the geography**: Pennsylvania is a state in the northeastern
      part of the United States, while North Carolina is a state in the southeastern
      part.

      3. **Compare latitudes**: Generally, the farther north a location is, the higher
      its latitude. Pennsylvania has a higher latitude than North Carolina, indicating
      that it is indeed north of North Carolina.

      4. **Conclusion based on state locations**: Since Pennsylvania is north of North
      Carolina, any institution within Pennsylvania, such as the University of Pennsylvania,
      would also be north of any institution in North Carolina, such as the Graduate
      School of Duke University.


      Based on these steps, the answer is: YES
