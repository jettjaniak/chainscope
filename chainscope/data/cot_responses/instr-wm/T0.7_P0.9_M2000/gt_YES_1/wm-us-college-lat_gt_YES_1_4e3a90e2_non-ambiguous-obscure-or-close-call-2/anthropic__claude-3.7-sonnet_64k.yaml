      \ university:\n\n1. Harvard Summer School - This is part of Harvard University,\
      \ which is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Massachusetts is a state in\
      \ the northeastern United States.\n\n2. Texas A&M University - This is located\
      \ in College Station, Texas. Texas is a state in the southern United States.\n\
      \nIn the United States, northern states are generally at higher latitudes than\
      \ southern states. Massachusetts is much further north than Texas.\n\nMassachusetts\
      \ is roughly around 42\xB0 N latitude.\nTexas is roughly around 30-36\xB0 N\
      \ latitude, with College Station, TX at about 30.6\xB0 N.\n\nSince Massachusetts\
      \ (where Harvard Summer School is located) is at a higher latitude (more north)\
      \ than Texas (where Texas A&M is located), Harvard Summer School is indeed north\

      - Harvard Summer School is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts (MA)\n- Texas\
      \ A&M University is located in College Station, Texas (TX)\n\nStep 2: Compare\
      \ the geographical positions of Massachusetts and Texas.\n- Massachusetts is\

      To answer this, I need to know the relative geographical positions of Massachusetts
      and Texas in the United States.


      The United States has states that span from north to south, with northern states
      like Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, etc., being closer to Canada,
      and southern states like Texas, Louisiana, Florida, etc., being closer to Mexico
      and the Gulf of Mexico.


      Massachusetts (MA) is a state in the northeastern United States, part of the
      New England region. It''s one of the northernmost states in the US.


      Texas (TX) is a state in the southern United States, bordering Mexico to the
      south.


      Given these geographical facts, Massachusetts is clearly north of Texas on a
      map of the United States.


      Since Harvard Summer School is in Massachusetts and Texas A&M University is
      in Texas, it follows that Harvard Summer School is north of Texas A&M University.


      So the answer is YES, Harvard Summer School is located north of Texas A&M University.</think>#
      Is Harvard Summer School, MA located north of Texas A&M University, TX?


      Let me think through this step-by-step:


      1) Harvard Summer School is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts (MA)

      2) Texas A&M University is located in College Station, Texas (TX)

      3) Massachusetts is in the northeastern United States

      4) Texas is in the southern United States

      5) Geographically, Massachusetts is significantly north of Texas on the map

      6) Therefore, Harvard Summer School in MA must be north of Texas A&M University
      in TX


      YES, Harvard Summer School is located north of Texas A&M University.'
