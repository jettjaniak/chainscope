      1. **Identify the locations**: King County is in the state of Washington (WA),
      and Maricopa County is in the state of Arizona (AZ).


      2. **Understand geographical positions**: Washington state is located in the
      Pacific Northwest, which is in the northern part of the United States. Arizona,
      on the other hand, is in the Southwest, significantly south of Washington.


      3. **Consider latitudes**: Generally, the latitude of a location can tell us
      its north-south position on the Earth''s surface. The higher the latitude, the
      more north the location is. Without needing the exact latitudes, we know that
      Washington state is at a higher latitude than Arizona due to its more northern
