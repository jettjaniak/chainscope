    2559ac4a-7a3b-4240-9007-0b95ae290cdb: 'To determine if King County, WA is located
      north of Maricopa County, AZ, I''ll identify where each county is located and
      compare their latitudes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - King County is in Washington state, which is in the Pacific Northwest region
      of the United States, bordering Canada.

      - Maricopa County is in Arizona, which is in the southwestern United States,
      bordering Mexico.


      Step 2: Consider the general north-south positioning of Washington and Arizona.

      - Washington state is one of the northernmost states in the contiguous US.

      - Arizona is much further south, close to the US-Mexico border.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Washington state is entirely north of Arizona.

      - Therefore, any county in Washington (including King County) would be north
      of any county in Arizona (including Maricopa County).


      YES, King County, WA is located north of Maricopa County, AZ.'
