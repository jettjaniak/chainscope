    0c048ac3-da3e-4ad9-8055-a78ad9db15f1: 'I need to determine the relative east-west
      positions of two New York institutions.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both institutions.

      - School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) is part of Columbia University,
      which is located in Manhattan, New York City.

      - Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine is located in Ithaca, New
      York.


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - New York City is located in southeastern New York state, near the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      - Ithaca is located in the Finger Lakes region in central/western New York state.

      - On a map of New York state, New York City is significantly east of Ithaca.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Since Columbia University (where SIPA is located) is in New York City, and
      Cornell''s Veterinary Medicine College is in Ithaca, the Columbia institution
      is east of the Cornell institution.


      YES, the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University is

      1) First, I need to determine the geographic locations of both universities.


      2) Boston University is located in Boston, Massachusetts, which is on the east
      coast of the United States.


      3) University of California, San Francisco is located in San Francisco, California,
      which is on the west coast of the United States.


      4) In the United States, the east coast is east of the west coast. Massachusetts
      is an east coast state, while California is a west coast state.


      5) Therefore, Boston (Massachusetts) is east of San Francisco (California).


      6) Since Boston University is in Boston and UC San Francisco is in San Francisco,
      Boston University is east of UC San Francisco.


      YES, Boston University in Massachusetts is located east of University of California,
      San Francisco in California.'
    b91a1558-dc04-426f-88ee-2aa3f5ad664e: 'I''ll solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Boston University is in Boston, Massachusetts (MA)

      - University of California, San Francisco is in San Francisco, California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these cities within the United
      States.

      - Boston is on the East Coast of the United States

      - San Francisco is on the West Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on a west-east axis.

      - The continental United States spans from west to east, with the West Coast
      being the westernmost part and the East Coast being the easternmost part

      - California is a West Coast state, while Massachusetts is an East Coast state

      - Therefore, Boston (MA) is east of San Francisco (CA)


      YES, Boston University, MA is located east of University of California, San

    e91a8f30-f5f6-42d6-82d8-357fd47751e3: 'To answer this question, I need to determine
      the relative east-west positions of Boston University in Massachusetts and the
      University of California, San Francisco in California.


      Step 1: Consider the geographic locations of Massachusetts and California within
      the United States.

      - Massachusetts is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States.


      Step 2: More specifically, Boston is in eastern Massachusetts, on the Atlantic
      Ocean.

      - Boston University is located in Boston, Massachusetts.


      Step 3: San Francisco is in western California, on the Pacific Ocean.

      - University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) is located in San Francisco,
      California.


      Step 4: In the United States, locations on the East Coast are east of locations
      on the West Coast.

      - The East Coast (including Boston) is east of the West Coast (including San
      Francisco).


      Therefore, Boston University in Massachusetts is located east of University
      of California, San Francisco in California.


      YES'

      - Boston University is in Boston, Massachusetts (MA)

      - University of California, San Francisco is in San Francisco, California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these cities within the United

      - Boston is located on the east coast of the United States

      - San Francisco is located on the west coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on a west-east axis.

      - The United States spans from west to east, with the west coast (including
      California) being on the western side and the east coast (including Massachusetts)
      being on the eastern side

      - Moving from west to east across the US, you would encounter San Francisco
      before Boston


      Step 4: Determine which is further east.

      - Since Boston is on the east coast and San Francisco is on the west coast,
      Boston is further east

      - Therefore, Boston University is located east of University of California,
      San Francisco


      YES, Boston University, MA is located east of University of California, San
      Francisco, CA.'
