      Columbia University is located in New York City, specifically in the Manhattan
      borough.


      Cornell University''s main campus is in Ithaca, NY, which is upstate New York.
      The College of Veterinary Medicine would be located on Cornell''s main campus

      - School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) is part of Columbia University,
      which is located in Manhattan, New York City, in the southeastern part of New
      York State.

      - Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine is located in Ithaca, NY,
      which is in the central/western part of upstate New York in the Finger Lakes
      region.

      - Arizona is in the Southwestern United States


      Florida is definitely east of Arizona on a map of the United States. Florida
      is one of the easternmost states, while Arizona is fairly western (though not

      - University of Phoenix is headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states

      - Florida is on the eastern coast of the United States

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States

      University of Phoenix (UoP) is located in Phoenix, Arizona (AZ), which is in
      the western United States.


      In terms of geography, locations in the eastern United States are east of locations

      Virginia Tech is located in Blacksburg, Virginia (VA). Virginia is on the east
      coast of the United States.


      Vanderbilt University is located in Nashville, Tennessee (TN). Tennessee is
      to the west of Virginia.


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Virginia is on the Atlantic coast, in the eastern part of the United States

      - Tennessee is more inland, to the west of Virginia


      Since Virginia Tech is in Virginia, and Vanderbilt is in Tennessee, Virginia
      Tech would be east of Vanderbilt University.


      Let me confirm this with more specific geography:

      - Blacksburg, VA (Virginia Tech) is in the western part of Virginia

      - Nashville, TN (Vanderbilt) is in the central part of Tennessee


      Even though Blacksburg is in western Virginia, Virginia as a state is still
      east of Tennessee. So Virginia Tech should still be east of Vanderbilt University.</think>I''ll
      solve this step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Virginia Tech is located in Blacksburg, Virginia (VA).

      - Vanderbilt University is located in Nashville, Tennessee (TN).


      Step 2: Consider the geographical relationship between Virginia and Tennessee.

      - Virginia is an east coast state along the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Tennessee is an inland state that lies to the west of Virginia.


      Step 3: Even though Virginia Tech is in the western part of Virginia (Blacksburg),
      Virginia as a whole is positioned east of Tennessee on the U.S. map.


      Step 4: Nashville, where Vanderbilt is located, is in the central part of Tennessee,
      which is clearly west of even the westernmost parts of Virginia.


      Therefore, YES, Virginia Tech is located east of Vanderbilt University.'

      1. The University of Chicago is located in Chicago, Illinois (IL)

      2. California Institute of Technology (Caltech) is located in Pasadena, California

      The United States generally has:

      - West Coast (including California)

      - Midwest (including Illinois)

      - East Coast


      Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic arrangement of these states within the US.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - Illinois is in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - States in the Midwest (including Illinois) are located east of the west coast
      states (including California)

      - Chicago is significantly east of Pasadena on any US map


      Therefore, the College of the University of Chicago in Illinois is indeed located

      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - Illinois (IL) is in the Midwest region of the United States

      - California (CA) is on the West Coast of the United States


      In terms of east-west geography, states get more eastern as you move from the
      West Coast toward the East Coast. The Midwest region (where Illinois is) is
      east of the West Coast (where California is).


      So geographically, Illinois is east of California.

      - Illinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Moving from west to east across the United States, you would encounter California
      before Illinois

      - The entire state of Illinois is geographically east of California

      - Therefore, Chicago, IL is east of locations in California


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion based on this geographic analysis.

      Since the University of Chicago is in Illinois (which is east of California),
      it is east of the California Institute of Technology.

    af211df5-1c36-4785-8a1a-fd302e2cc0a3: '<think>This is a geography question. I
      need to determine the relative positions of Boston University in Massachusetts
      and the University of California, San Francisco in California.


      Boston University is located in Boston, Massachusetts, which is on the east
      coast of the United States.


      The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) is located in San Francisco,
      California, which is on the west coast of the United States.


      In the United States, the east coast is east of the west coast. Massachusetts
      is an east coast state, while California is a west coast state.


      Therefore, Boston University in MA is located east of the University of California,
      San Francisco in CA.</think>To answer this question, I need to think about the
      geographic locations of these two universities.


      Step 1: Identify where Boston University is located.

      Boston University is in Boston, Massachusetts, which is on the east coast of
      the United States.


      Step 2: Identify where University of California, San Francisco is located.

      UC San Francisco is in San Francisco, California, which is on the west coast
      of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis.

      In the United States, the west coast (California) is to the west of the east
      coast (Massachusetts). Moving from west to east across the continental US, you
      would go from California to Massachusetts.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Massachusetts is on the east coast and California is on the west coast,
      Boston University is east of UC San Francisco.


      YES'
    baf1110c-6d7c-4512-85ce-0345d86e8eed: '<think>I need to determine if Boston University
      in Massachusetts is located east of University of California, San Francisco
      in California.


      To solve this, I need to compare the geographical locations:


      1. Boston University is located in Boston, Massachusetts, which is on the East
      Coast of the United States.

      2. University of California, San Francisco is located in San Francisco, California,
      which is on the West Coast of the United States.


      In the United States, the East Coast is east of the West Coast. That is, locations
      on the East Coast (like Boston) are east of locations on the West Coast (like
      San Francisco).


      Therefore, Boston University in Massachusetts is located east of University
      of California, San Francisco in California.</think>I''ll think about this step
      by step to determine the relative locations of these universities.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both universities.

      - Boston University is located in Boston, Massachusetts

      - University of California, San Francisco is located in San Francisco, California


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these cities within the United
      States.

      - Boston is on the East Coast of the United States

      - San Francisco is on the West Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Determine the east-west relationship.

      - In the United States, the East Coast is east of the West Coast

      - Boston (East Coast) is therefore east of San Francisco (West Coast)


      Step 4: Make the final determination about the universities'' relative positions.

      - Since Boston University is in Boston (East Coast) and UC San Francisco is
      in San Francisco (West Coast), Boston University is east of UC San Francisco


      YES'
