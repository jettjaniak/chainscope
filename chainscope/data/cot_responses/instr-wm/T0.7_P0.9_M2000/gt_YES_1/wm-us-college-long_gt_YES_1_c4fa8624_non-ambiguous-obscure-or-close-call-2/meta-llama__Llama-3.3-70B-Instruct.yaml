      3. **Compare the longitudes**: To determine if one location is east of the other,
      we can compare their longitudes. The longitude of a place tells us how far east
      or west it is. Places with higher longitude values are more to the east (up
      to 180 degrees, after which they are considered west).


      4. **Virginia Tech''s longitude**: Blacksburg, VA, where Virginia Tech is located,
      has a longitude of approximately 80.4 degrees West.


      5. **Vanderbilt University''s longitude**: Nashville, TN, where Vanderbilt University
