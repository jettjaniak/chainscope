      positions relative to each other, specifically in terms of east-west orientation.


      1. **University of Virginia Location**: The University of Virginia is located
      in Charlottesville, Virginia. Virginia is on the East Coast of the United States.


      2. **Texas A&M University Location**: Texas A&M University is located in College
      Station, Texas. Texas is in the southern United States and is considered to
      be in the South Central region, which is west of the East Coast.


      3. **Comparison**: Given that Virginia is on the East Coast and Texas is west
      of the East Coast, we can conclude that the University of Virginia in Virginia
      is east of Texas A&M University in Texas.


      Therefore, the answer to whether the University of Virginia, VA is located east
      of Texas A&M University, TX is: **YES**'
