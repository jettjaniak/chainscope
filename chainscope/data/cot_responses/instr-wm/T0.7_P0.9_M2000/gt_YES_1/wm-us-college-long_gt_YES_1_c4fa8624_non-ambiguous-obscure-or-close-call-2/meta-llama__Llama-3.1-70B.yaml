    c1d27f05-f12f-410c-beb0-ba6864a47254: 'To answer this question, we need to determine
      the geographical locations of the University of Virginia in Virginia and Texas
      A&M University in Texas and then compare their positions relative to each other,
      specifically in terms of east-west orientation.


      1. **University of Virginia Location**: The University of Virginia is located
      in Charlottesville, Virginia. Virginia is on the East Coast of the United States.


      2. **Texas A&M University Location**: Texas A&M University is located in College
