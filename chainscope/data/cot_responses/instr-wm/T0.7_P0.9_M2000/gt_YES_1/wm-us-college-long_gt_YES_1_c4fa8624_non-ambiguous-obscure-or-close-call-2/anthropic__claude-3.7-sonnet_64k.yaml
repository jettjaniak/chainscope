      of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University in New York is located
      east of the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in New York.


      To solve this, I''ll determine the locations of both institutions and compare
      their east-west positions.


      Step 1: Determine the location of the School of International and Public Affairs
      (SIPA) at Columbia University.

      Columbia University is located in New York City, specifically in the Manhattan
      borough. The School of International and Public Affairs is part of Columbia
      University''s campus.


      Step 2: Determine the location of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.

      Cornell University is located in Ithaca, New York, which is in the central/western
      part of New York State. The College of Veterinary Medicine is on Cornell''s
      main campus in Ithaca.


      Step 3: Compare the east-west positions.

      New York City (Manhattan) is located in the southeastern part of New York State,
      along the Atlantic coast.

      Ithaca is located in central/western New York State, far from the coast.


      On a map of New York State, New York City is definitely east of Ithaca.


      Therefore, the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University
      (in NYC) is east of the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine (in
      Ithaca).


      The answer is YES.</think># Is School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia
      University, NY located east of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine,
      NY?


      I''ll think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to determine where each institution is located within New York
      State.


      2) Columbia University, including its School of International and Public Affairs,
      is located in Manhattan, New York City, which is in the southeastern part of
      New York State.


      3) Cornell University, including its College of Veterinary Medicine, is located
      in Ithaca, New York, which is in the central/western part of New York State.


      4) On a map of New York State, New York City (where Columbia is) is significantly
      further east than Ithaca (where Cornell is).


      5) Therefore, the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University
      is indeed east of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.

      First, let me establish the locations of these two institutions:


      1. The School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) is part of Columbia
      University, which is located in Manhattan, New York City, NY.


      2. Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine is located in Ithaca, NY,
      as part of Cornell University''s main campus.


      Now, to determine which is further east, I need to consider their relative geographical
      positions in New York state:


      Manhattan (where Columbia University is located) is in southeastern New York,
      near the Atlantic coast.


      Ithaca (where Cornell University is located) is in the Finger Lakes region of
      central New York state.


      In terms of east-west positioning, Manhattan/New York City is significantly
      east of Ithaca. New York City is close to the eastern edge of New York state,
      bordering the Atlantic Ocean, while Ithaca is in central New York state, several
      hours drive to the west of NYC.


      So, the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University (in

      \n2) Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine is located in Ithaca,\

      northeastern United States.

      2. Arizona State University is in Tempe, Arizona (AZ), which is in the southwestern
      United States.


      In the United States, states that are east have a greater longitude (more towards

      - Massachusetts is on the east coast of the United States

      - Arizona is in the western part of the United States, though not on the west
      coast


      On a map of the United States, if we look from west to east (left to right):

      - The west coast states include California, Oregon, and Washington

      - Moving east, we encounter states like Nevada, Arizona, etc.

      - Further east are states like Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, etc.

      - The northeast region includes states like Massachusetts, New York, etc.


      So Massachusetts is definitely east of Arizona.


      Since Harvard Summer School is in Massachusetts and Arizona State University

      State University in Arizona (AZ).


      To answer this, I need to think about the geographical locations of these two
      places in the United States.


      Massachusetts is located in the northeastern part of the United States, on the
      East Coast.

      Arizona is located in the southwestern part of the United States.


      In terms of geographic orientation in the United States:

      - East Coast states like Massachusetts are on the eastern edge of the country

      - Southwestern states like Arizona are in the western half of the country


      Looking at the continental United States from west to east:

      - The West Coast includes states like California, Oregon, and Washington

      - The Southwest includes states like Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada

      - The Midwest is in the central part of the country

      - The East Coast includes states like Massachusetts, New York, and other northeastern
      states


      Since Massachusetts is on the East Coast and Arizona is in the Southwest, Massachusetts
      is definitely east of Arizona.


      Therefore, Harvard Summer School in MA is located east of Arizona State University
      in AZ.


      The answer is YES.</think>To determine if Harvard Summer School, MA is located
      east of Arizona State University, AZ, I need to consider the geographical locations
      of Massachusetts and Arizona within the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both states.

      - Massachusetts (MA) is located in the northeastern United States, on the East
      Coast.

      - Arizona (AZ) is located in the southwestern United States.


      Step 2: Compare their east-west positions.

      - The continental United States generally spans from the Pacific Ocean (west)
      to the Atlantic Ocean (east).

      - Massachusetts borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east.

      - Arizona is in the western half of the country, significantly west of Massachusetts.


      Step 3: Determine the directional relationship.

      - When moving from Arizona to Massachusetts, one travels eastward.

      - Therefore, Massachusetts is east of Arizona.


      Since Harvard Summer School is in Massachusetts and Arizona State University
      is in Arizona, Harvard Summer School is located east of Arizona State University.

      of Phoenix (in Arizona).


      To answer this, I need to think about the geographical locations of Florida
      and Arizona in the United States.


      The United States is laid out with the east coast facing the Atlantic Ocean
      and the west coast facing the Pacific Ocean. Going from west to east, the states
      are roughly in this order:

      - West Coast states (including California, Oregon, Washington)

      - Mountain states (including Arizona, Colorado, Utah, etc.)

      - Central states

      - Southern and Midwestern states

      - East Coast states (including Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina, etc.)


      Arizona is in the southwestern part of the United States, in the Mountain region.
      It borders California to its west, and states like New Mexico to its east.


      Florida is on the southeast coast of the United States, in the East Coast region.
      It''s one of the easternmost states in the country.


      Since Florida is on the east coast and Arizona is much further west, Florida
      State University (in Florida) would be east of the University of Phoenix (in
      Arizona).


      So the answer is YES, Florida State University is located east of University

      - Florida State University is located in Tallahassee, Florida

      - University of Phoenix is headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Florida and Arizona within the
      United States.

      - Florida is on the southeastern coast of the United States, bordering the Atlantic
      Ocean

      - Arizona is in the southwestern United States, between California and New Mexico

      east of the University of Texas at Austin College of Liberal Arts in Texas.


      To answer this, I need to know the relative locations of these two institutions
      on a map of the United States.


      Duke University is located in Durham, North Carolina, which is on the east coast
      of the United States.


      The University of Texas at Austin is located in Austin, Texas, which is in the
      south-central part of the United States.


      On a map of the United States, North Carolina is located to the east of Texas.
      In other words, if you were to move eastward from Texas, you would eventually
      reach North Carolina (though you''d pass through some other states first).


      Since Duke University is in North Carolina and UT Austin is in Texas, it follows
      that Duke University is located east of UT Austin.


      So, the Graduate School of Duke University in NC is located east of the University
      of Texas at Austin College of Liberal Arts in TX.


      The answer is YES.</think># Step-by-Step Reasoning


      To determine if Duke University''s Graduate School is east of UT Austin''s College
      of Liberal Arts, I need to identify their geographic locations.


      1) Duke University is located in Durham, North Carolina

      2) The University of Texas at Austin is located in Austin, Texas

      3) On a U.S. map, North Carolina is on the East Coast

      4) Texas is in the south-central part of the United States

      5) North Carolina is significantly east of Texas


      Looking at the geographic positions of these states, North Carolina sits along
      the Atlantic Ocean on the eastern seaboard, while Texas is much further west
      in the central-southern portion of the country.


      Since Duke University is in North Carolina and UT Austin is in Texas, Duke''s
      Graduate School is indeed east of UT Austin''s College of Liberal Arts.


      YES'

      Let me think about the geography of the United States:

      - Virginia is a state on the east coast of the United States.

      - Texas is a state in the southern central part of the United States, bordering
      the Gulf of Mexico.


      Just from general knowledge of US geography, Virginia is definitely east of
      Texas. The entire state of Virginia is east of the entire state of Texas.


      University of Virginia is in Charlottesville, Virginia, and Texas A&M University
      is in College Station, Texas. Given that Virginia is entirely east of Texas,
      it follows that University of Virginia (in Virginia) must be east of Texas A&M

      University of Virginia is located in Charlottesville, Virginia (VA). Virginia
      is a state on the east coast of the United States.


      Texas A&M University is located in College Station, Texas (TX). Texas is a state
      in the southern central part of the United States.


      The United States has its east coast facing the Atlantic Ocean and its west

      \ to determine the relative geographic locations of Boston University in Massachusetts\
      \ and the University of California, San Francisco in California.\n\nStep 1:\
      \ Determine the approximate location of Boston University.\nBoston University\
      \ is located in Boston, Massachusetts, which is on the east coast of the United\
      \ States.\n\nStep 2: Determine the approximate location of University of California,\
      \ San Francisco.\nThe University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) is located\
      \ in San Francisco, California, which is on the west coast of the United States.\n\
      \nStep 3: Compare the east-west positions of these locations.\nThe United States\
      \ spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific Ocean on the west.\
      \ Massachusetts is an east coast state bordering the Atlantic Ocean, while California\
      \ is a west coast state bordering the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIf we think about the\
      \ map of the United States, Massachusetts is significantly east of California.\
      \ Therefore, Boston (in Massachusetts) is east of San Francisco (in California).\n\
      \nStep 4: Confirm the directional relationship.\nSince Boston is east of San\
      \ Francisco, it follows that Boston University is east of University of California,\
      \ San Francisco.\n\nHowever, I should be careful about the wording of the question.\
      \ It asks if Boston University is located east of UCSF. Since Boston is on the\
      \ east coast and San Francisco is on the west coast, Boston is actually east\
      \ of San Francisco. Therefore, Boston University is east of UCSF.\n\nActually,\
      \ let me double-check my logic. The question is asking if Boston University\
      \ is east of UCSF. \n\nWhen we say \"A is east of B,\" it means that A is located\
      \ in a more easterly direction than B, or in other words, A is to the east of\
      \ B on a map.\n\nBoston is on the east coast of the US, and San Francisco is\
      \ on the west coast. When looking at a map of the US, Boston would be to the\
      \ right (east) of San Francisco. \n\nBut wait, I've been making an error in\
      \ my reasoning. I've been assuming that \"east of\" means \"to the right of\
      \ on a map,\" but that's only true for maps oriented with north at the top.\
      \ \n\nLet me think about this in terms of longitude. East and west are determined\
      \ by longitude, with east being at higher longitude values (up to 180\xB0 East)\
      \ and west being at lower longitude values (down to 180\xB0 West, which is the\
      \ same as 180\xB0 East but on the opposite side of the Earth).\n\nThe continental\
      \ United States spans from roughly 67\xB0 West to 125\xB0 West longitude. The\
      \ east coast, including Boston, is around 71\xB0 West longitude. The west coast,\
      \ including San Francisco, is around 122\xB0 West longitude.\n\nSo Boston, at\
      \ around 71\xB0 West, is at a higher (less negative) longitude value than San\
      \ Francisco, at around 122\xB0 West. This confirms that Boston is east of San\
      \ Francisco.\n\nTherefore, Boston University, located in Boston, MA, is east\
      \ of the University of California, San Francisco, located in San Francisco,\
      \ CA.\n\nSo the answer is YES.\n\nActually, let me verify this using a different\
      \ approach. When traveling from San Francisco to Boston, you would generally\
      \ go eastward. And when traveling from Boston to San Francisco, you would generally\
      \ go westward. This confirms that Boston is east of San Francisco, and therefore\
      \ Boston University is east of UCSF.\n\nSo the answer is YES, Boston University\
      \ in MA is located east of University of California, San Francisco in CA.</think>#\
      \ Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nTo determine if Boston University is east of University\

      \   - Boston is located at approximately 71\xB0 West longitude\n   - San Francisco\
      \ is located at approximately 122\xB0 West longitude\n   - Lower (less negative)\
      \ west longitude numbers indicate more easterly positions\n\n5) Since 71\xB0\
      \ West is less negative than 122\xB0 West, Boston is east of San Francisco.\n\
