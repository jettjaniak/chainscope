    2984704d-a0da-4569-b99e-a86b8176c0cc: "<think>Okay, let's try to figure out whether\
      \ the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) at Columbia University\
      \ in New York is located east of the Cornell University College of Veterinary\
      \ Medicine. \n\nFirst, I need to know where each of these schools is located.\
      \ Let's start with Columbia University. Columbia's main campus is in New York\
      \ City, specifically in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. SIPA\
      \ is part of Columbia, so it's likely in the same area. Manhattan is on the\
      \ island in the southeastern part of New York State.\n\nNow, Cornell University\
      \ is in Ithaca, New York. The College of Veterinary Medicine is part of Cornell,\
      \ so that's in Ithaca as well. Ithaca is in upstate New York, which is generally\
      \ considered the northern part of the state, west of the Hudson River. \n\n\
      Next, I should check the geographical positions. Manhattan (Columbia) is in\
      \ the southeastern part of New York State, while Ithaca (Cornell Vet School)\
      \ is in the central-western part. To determine east-west positions, longitude\
      \ is key. Places with a higher longitude (more to the east) are further east.\
      \ \n\nLooking at coordinates, Columbia University in NYC is at approximately\
      \ 40.8075\xB0 N, 73.9625\xB0 W. Cornell's coordinates are around 42.4485\xB0\
      \ N, 76.4802\xB0 W. Comparing the longitudes: Columbia is at -73.96, Cornell\
      \ at -76.48. Since longitude decreases as you go east (because west longitudes\
      \ are negative numbers increasing westward), a smaller number (less negative)\
      \ is more east. So -73.96 is more east than -76.48. Therefore, Columbia is east\
      \ of Cornell's Vet School. \n\nWait, but I should confirm the exact locations.\
      \ Maybe I made a mistake with the coordinates. Let me verify. Quick search:\
      \ Columbia University is indeed in NYC (Manhattan), and Cornell is in Ithaca.\
      \ NYC is on the eastern side of New York State, while Ithaca is to the northwest\
      \ of NYC. So in terms of east-west, NYC is east of Ithaca. Therefore, Columbia's\
      \ SIPA would be east of Cornell's Vet Med. So the answer is YES.\n</think>YES\
      \  \nColumbia University's School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA)\
      \ is located in New York City, which is in southeastern New York State. Cornell\
      \ University's College of Veterinary Medicine is in Ithaca, NY, situated in\
      \ the central-western part of the state. Since New York City lies significantly\
      \ further east than Ithaca (as confirmed by their respective longitudes: NYC\
      \ at \u2248-73.96\xB0 vs. Ithaca at \u2248-76.48\xB0), SIPA at Columbia is indeed\
      \ east of Cornell's veterinary campus. \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    33df2994-3e2c-4579-9a8f-84038be4713c: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, we need to figure out if the School of International and Public Affairs\
      \ (SIPA) at Columbia University in New York is located east of Cornell University's\
      \ College of Veterinary Medicine, also in New York. \n\nFirst, I should probably\
      \ start by recalling where each of these institutions is located. I know that\
      \ Columbia University is in New York City, specifically in the Manhattan area.\
      \ SIPA is one of their graduate schools, so it's likely on the main campus in\
      \ Morningside Heights, Manhattan. \n\nOn the other hand, Cornell University\
      \ is in Ithaca, which is upstate New York. But wait, the question specifically\
      \ mentions the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell. Is that in Ithaca\
      \ as well? I think Cornell's main campus is in Ithaca, so their vet school would\
      \ be there too. \n\nNow, I need to determine the geographical positions relative\
      \ to each other. New York City is in the southeastern part of New York State,\
      \ while Ithaca is in the central part, near the Finger Lakes region. So, if\
      \ Columbia is in NYC and Cornell's vet school is in Ithaca, which is to the\
      \ northwest of NYC, then the answer would be yes, because NYC (where Columbia\
      \ is) is southeast of Ithaca. Wait, but the question is whether SIPA is east\
      \ of Cornell's vet school. So, if Ithaca is northwest of NYC, then NYC is southeast\
      \ of Ithaca. That would mean that SIPA (NYC) is southeast of Cornell Vet School\
      \ (Ithaca). But the question is asking if it's east. So, even if it's southeast,\
      \ that still means it's east. So yes, Columbia's SIPA is east of Cornell's Vet\
      \ Med.\n\nWait, but maybe I should confirm the exact locations. Let me think.\
      \ New York City is on the eastern edge of New York State, along the Atlantic\
      \ Ocean. Ithaca is in Tompkins County, which is in the central-western part\
      \ of the state. So the longitude of Ithaca would be west of the longitude of\
      \ NYC. Therefore, any point in NYC would have a more easterly longitude than\
      \ Ithaca. So Columbia, being in NYC, would indeed be east of Cornell's vet school\
      \ in Ithaca. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\
      \  \n1. **Locate Columbia University's SIPA:** It is in New York City (Manhattan),\
      \ situated in southeastern New York State.  \n2. **Locate Cornell's Veterinary\
      \ College:** Cornell University is in Ithaca, NY, located in the central-western\
      \ part of the state.  \n3. **Compare Longitudes:** NYC (Columbia) has a more\
      \ easterly longitude (~74\xB0W) than Ithaca (~76.5\xB0W).  \n4. **Conclusion:**\
      \ Since NYC is east of Ithaca, SIPA is east of Cornell's Veterinary College.\
      \  \n\n**Answer:** YES"

      \ that Columbia University is in New York City, specifically in Manhattan. The\
      \ main campus is in Morningside Heights, which is on the west side of Manhattan.\
      \ So SIPA, being part of Columbia, is probably there. \n\nCornell University,\
      \ on the other hand, is in Ithaca, NY. Ithaca is upstate, in the central part\
      \ of New York State. Now, I need to figure out the relative positions. New York\
      \ City is in the southeastern part of New York State, while Ithaca is more to\
      \ the northwest within the state. \n\nWait, but directions can be tricky. Let\
      \ me think about the coordinates. Maybe looking up the approximate latitudes\
      \ and longitudes would help. Columbia University in NYC is around 40.8075\xB0\
      \ N, 73.9626\xB0 W. Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca is approximately\
      \ 42.4485\xB0 N, 76.4762\xB0 W. \n\nLongitude is key here for east-west direction.\
      \ Since longitude lines run north-south, a more easterly point has a smaller\
      \ (more negative) longitude if we're in the western hemisphere. Wait, in the\
      \ US, all longitudes are west, so a lower longitude number (closer to 0) is\
      \ more east. So, Columbia's longitude is about -73.96, and Cornell's is -76.47.\
      \ Since -73.96 is more east than -76.47, that means Columbia is east of Cornell.\

    824d0c16-fea1-4728-b7cd-f406d7e64c69: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, I need to determine if the School of International and Public Affairs\
      \ (SIPA) at Columbia University in New York is located east of the Cornell University\
      \ College of Veterinary Medicine in New York. \n\nFirst, I should figure out\
      \ where each of these schools is located. I know that Columbia University is\
      \ in New York City, specifically in the Manhattan area. SIPA is part of Columbia,\

      \ University is in Ithaca, NY. Wait, but the College of Veterinary Medicine\
      \ is part of Cornell, right? So that should also be in Ithaca.\n\nNow, I need\
      \ to compare their geographic locations. New York City (where Columbia is) is\
      \ in the southeastern part of New York State. Ithaca is in the central part,\
      \ specifically in the Finger Lakes region. To figure out the east-west positioning,\
      \ I should look at the longitude. Places with a higher longitude (more east)\
      \ are further east. \n\nLet me recall the approximate longitudes. New York City\
      \ is around 74 degrees West longitude, but wait, actually, longitude decreases\
      \ as you go east in the Western Hemisphere (since we measure west from the prime\
      \ meridian). So lower longitude (closer to 0) would be further east. New York\
      \ City is at about 74\xB0W, while Ithaca is around 76\xB0W. Wait, that means\
      \ NYC is east of Ithaca because 74 is less than 76 (since they are both west\
      \ longitude). So if Columbia is in NYC (74\xB0W) and Cornell Vet School is in\
      \ Ithaca (76\xB0W), then Columbia is indeed east of Cornell. \n\nWait, let me\
      \ double-check. Let me confirm the coordinates. Columbia University's main campus\
      \ is in Manhattan, New York City. The coordinates for NYC are approximately\
      \ 40.7128\xB0 N, 74.0060\xB0 W. Cornell University in Ithaca is at approximately\
      \ 42.4440\xB0 N, 76.4844\xB0 W. So comparing the longitudes: 74.0060\xB0 W vs.\
      \ 76.4844\xB0 W. Since longitude is measured west from the prime meridian, a\
      \ smaller degree value (closer to 0) means further east. Therefore, 74\xB0W\
      \ is east of 76\xB0W. That means NYC (Columbia) is east of Ithaca (Cornell Vet\
      \ School). \n\nSo the answer should be YES, SIPA at Columbia is located east\

      \ Explanation:**  \n1. **Locate the Institutions:**  \n   - Columbia University's\

      \ (Manhattan).  \n   - Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine is\

      \nFirst, Columbia University is in New York City, right? Specifically, the main\

      \ so the vet school would be there as well. Ithaca is in upstate New York, which\
      \ is northwest of New York City. \n\nSo New York City is on the southeastern\
      \ part of New York state. Ithaca is in the Finger Lakes region, which is more\
      \ towards the central-west part. To compare their positions: if I look at a\
      \ map, NYC is on the east side of the state, right along the Atlantic coast.\
      \ Ithaca is inland and further north and west. So, from NYC to Ithaca, you'd\
      \ be traveling northwest.\n\nNow, longitude-wise, places further east have higher\
      \ longitude values if we're using the western hemisphere (since longitude decreases\
      \ as you go west). But for the purpose of direction, the key is their relative\
      \ positions. Since NYC is on the eastern edge of the state and Ithaca is more\
      \ to the west, Columbia (NYC) would be east of Cornell (Ithaca). \n\nWait, but\

    d5b5b2d7-16bf-40b9-94f7-446237745b0d: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\

      \ College of Veterinary Medicine in New York. Alright, first, I need to figure\
      \ out where each of these schools is located.\n\nStarting with Columbia's SIPA.\
      \ I know that Columbia University's main campus is in Manhattan, New York City.\
      \ Specifically, it's in the Morningside Heights neighborhood. So the address\
      \ would be somewhere in Manhattan, which is part of New York City. Now, Manhattan\
      \ is on the island of Manhattan, and the coordinates, if I recall, are roughly\

      \ is about east vs. west. Since longitude lines run north-south, a more easterly\
      \ longitude is a smaller (more negative) number west, right? Wait, longitude\
      \ west is measured in degrees west of the prime meridian. So, a higher west\
      \ longitude (like 76) is further west than a lower one (like 73). \n\nSo, if\

      \ If you look at a map, Ithaca is west of New York City. Because New York City\
      \ is on the eastern edge of New York state, while Ithaca is more towards the\

      \ which one is east? Longitude coordinates would help here. Let me think: the\
      \ longitude for NYC is around 74 degrees west, and Ithaca is around 76 degrees\
      \ west? Wait, no, wait, actually, the more west the longitude, the further west\
      \ the location. So, if NYC is at approximately 74\xB0W, and Ithaca is around\
      \ 76\xB0W, then NYC is actually further east because 74 is less than 76. So\
      \ a lower longitude number means further east. \n\nYes, that's right. So, since\
      \ NYC (Columbia) is at a longitude of around 73.97\xB0W, and Ithaca (Cornell)\
      \ is around 76.5\xB0W, the longitude for Ithaca is higher (more west), meaning\

      \ school. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the exact coordinates to be sure.\
      \ Maybe I can recall or estimate. New York City's longitude is roughly 74\xB0\
      W. Ithaca, NY, is indeed further west. For example, the coordinates for Cornell\
      \ University are approximately 42.45\xB0N latitude, 76.48\xB0W longitude. Meanwhile,\
      \ Columbia University in NYC is around 40.81\xB0N, 73.96\xB0W. Comparing the\
      \ longitudes: 73.96\xB0W vs. 76.48\xB0W. Since 73.96 is less than 76.48, that\

      \ of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) at Columbia University in New York\

      \ I need to locate both institutions. Columbia University is in New York City,\
      \ specifically in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. I remember\
      \ that Manhattan is on the west side of the Hudson River, so it's in the eastern\
      \ part of New York State. \n\nCornell University is in Ithaca, NY. Ithaca is\
      \ upstate, in the Finger Lakes region. Now, I need to check the relative positions.\
      \ I know that Ithaca is northwest of New York City. Wait, let me confirm that.\
      \ Looking at a map, New York City is in the southeastern part of the state,\
      \ while Ithaca is in the central part, near the southern end of Cayuga Lake.\
      \ So, if I draw a line from NYC to Ithaca, Ithaca is indeed to the northwest.\
      \ \n\nBut wait, east and west are relative. To determine which is further east,\
      \ I should compare their longitudes. The longitude lines run north-south, with\
      \ higher values going west. So, a place further east would have a lower longitude\
      \ (more negative if using the western hemisphere). \n\nLet me look up the coordinates.\

      \ W. Cornell's Vet College in Ithaca is around 42.4485\xB0 N, 76.4759\xB0 W.\
      \ \n\nComparing the longitudes: Columbia is at -73.96, Cornell Vet at -76.47.\
      \ Since -73.96 is a higher number (less negative) than -76.47, that means Columbia\

      \nWait, but longitude for the western hemisphere is measured in degrees west,\
      \ so higher numerical values (like 76 vs 73) mean further west. So, yes, since\

      \ positions of Manhattan and Ithaca relative to each other. I remember that\
      \ Ithaca is in upstate New York, which is generally north and west of New York\

      \ School. I know that Harvard University is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The\
      \ Summer School is part of Harvard, so it's probably in the same area. Cambridge\
      \ is just outside Boston, right? So that's in the northeastern part of the United\
      \ States.\n\nNow, Arizona State University is in Arizona. The main campus is\
      \ in Tempe, which is part of the Phoenix metropolitan area. Arizona is in the\
      \ southwestern US. So, comparing the two states, Massachusetts is on the East\
      \ Coast, and Arizona is in the Southwest. \n\nBut wait, the question is about\
      \ being east. So, east in terms of longitude. The easternmost point of Arizona\
      \ versus the westernmost point of Massachusetts? Or just the general locations.\
      \ Let me think. Massachusetts is definitely to the east of Arizona. Because\
      \ the US is laid out with the East Coast states like Massachusetts being much\
      \ further east than the southwestern states like Arizona. \n\nBut to be precise,\
      \ maybe I should check the approximate longitudes. Let me recall. The longitude\
      \ lines run north to south, with higher values going west. Wait, no, actually,\
      \ longitude is measured from the prime meridian (0\xB0) going east and west.\
      \ For the US, the eastern states have lower longitude values (west longitude\
      \ is negative in some systems). For example, Boston, MA is around 71 degrees\
      \ west longitude. Phoenix, AZ is around 112 degrees west longitude. Since the\
      \ lower the longitude (more east), the further east the location is. So Boston\

      \ W. Arizona State University's main campus is in Tempe, AZ. The coordinates\
      \ there are approximately 33.4255\xB0 N, 111.9400\xB0 W. \n\nLongitude is the\
      \ key here because east-west position is determined by longitude. The lower\
      \ the longitude number, the farther east a location is. So if Harvard's longitude\

      \ the west longitude system, so places farther east have lower longitude values\
      \ (more negative if considering west as negative). But sometimes people might\
      \ get confused because longitude west of the prime meridian is measured in degrees\
      \ west, so higher numbers going west. Wait, no, actually, in terms of decimal\
      \ coordinates, longitude for the US would be negative when west of the prime\
      \ meridian. For example, the east coast would be around -70 to -75, and the\

      \ is measured from 0 at the prime meridian, increasing eastward to 180 and westward\
      \ to -180. So, locations in the eastern US would have a longitude that's west\
      \ of the prime meridian, hence negative values, but higher (less negative) than\
      \ locations further west. For example, New York is around -74 degrees, while\
      \ Arizona might be around -112 degrees. So, the more west a place is, the more\
      \ negative its longitude. Therefore, Harvard in Massachusetts would have a longitude\

      \ are relative to the prime meridian. In the US, all states are west of the\
      \ prime meridian, so their longitudes are in the west (negative degrees). \n\
      \nSo, for example, Massachusetts would have a longitude around -71 degrees (since\
      \ Boston is roughly -71.05). Arizona State in Tempe, AZ, would be around -111.9\
      \ degrees. Wait, but longitude is measured from 0 at the prime meridian (Greenwich,\
      \ UK) going west to -180 and east to +180. So, the more negative the longitude,\
      \ the further west the location is. \n\nSo, if Harvard is at around -71 degrees\
      \ and ASU is at -111.9, then Harvard is less negative, meaning it's further\
      \ east. Because -71 is east of -111.9. So, yes, Massachusetts is east of Arizona.\
      \ Therefore, Harvard Summer School in MA is east of Arizona State University\
      \ in AZ. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the exact coordinates. Let me think: Cambridge,\
      \ MA is approximately 42.37\xB0 N, 71.11\xB0 W. Tempe, AZ is approximately 33.42\xB0\
      \ N, 111.94\xB0 W. So comparing the longitudes: Cambridge is -71.11, Tempe is\
      \ -111.94. Since -71.11 is a smaller number (less west), that means Cambridge\
      \ is east of Tempe. Therefore, Harvard is indeed east of ASU. So the answer\
      \ should be YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Locations\

      \ longitude (less negative) means further east. Since 71.11\xB0 W is less west\
      \ than 111.94\xB0 W, Cambridge (MA) is east of Tempe (AZ).  \n\n**Answer:**\
      \ YES, Harvard Summer School, MA is east of Arizona State University, AZ."

      \ Harvard Summer School in Massachusetts is east of Arizona State University\
      \ in Arizona. Hmm, first I need to know where each of these places is located.\
      \ \n\nHarvard Summer School is part of Harvard University, which is in Cambridge,\
      \ Massachusetts. Arizona State University is in Arizona, specifically in Tempe,\
      \ I think. Now, I need to compare their geographical positions, east to west.\
      \ \n\nSo, the United States maps usually have the east coast on the right (east)\
      \ and the west coast on the left (west). Massachusetts is on the east coast,\
      \ right? Like, Boston is a major city there. Arizona is in the southwest part\
      \ of the US. Cities like Phoenix are there. So, Massachusetts is definitely\
      \ farther east than Arizona. \n\nBut wait, let me be precise. Maybe I should\
      \ check the exact longitudes. Longitude measures how far east or west a place\
      \ is. The higher the longitude (in the western hemisphere), the further west\
      \ it is. So for example, if Arizona has a higher longitude (more west), then\
      \ Massachusetts would be east of it. \n\nWait, longitude is measured in degrees\
      \ west of the prime meridian. So, Cambridge, MA: I think its longitude is around\
      \ 71 degrees west. Tempe, AZ: looking up in my mind, Phoenix area is about 112\
      \ degrees west. So, since 71 degrees is less than 112, that means Cambridge\
      \ is east of Tempe. Therefore, Harvard Summer School (in Cambridge, MA) is east\
      \ of Arizona State University (Tempe, AZ). So the answer should be YES. \n\n\
      Wait, but I need to make sure I didn't mix up the longitudes. Maybe I should\
      \ recall that New York is around 74 degrees west, and Arizona is definitely\
      \ further west than that. So Massachusetts being east of New York would have\
      \ a lower longitude. So yes, 71 for Cambridge, MA versus 112 for Tempe, AZ.\
      \ Since lower longitude means more east, then yes, Harvard is east of ASU. \n\
      \nI don't think I confused latitude and longitude here. Latitude is north-south,\

      \ asking if Harvard Summer School in Massachusetts is located east of Arizona\
      \ State University in Arizona. Hmm, first I need to figure out where each of\
      \ these places is.\n\nI know Harvard is in Massachusetts, specifically in Cambridge,\
      \ which is near Boston. So Harvard Summer School would be in the same location\
      \ as the main campus, right? Then Arizona State University is in Arizona, probably\
      \ in a city like Tempe, which is part of the Phoenix metropolitan area. \n\n\
      Now, I need to determine their geographical positions relative to each other.\
      \ The United States is generally laid out with the East Coast states on the\
      \ right side (like Massachusetts) and the West Coast on the left. Arizona is\
      \ a southwestern state, so I think it's pretty far west compared to Massachusetts.\
      \ \n\nWait, but let me be more precise. The easternmost point of Arizona would\
      \ still be west of the westernmost point of Massachusetts. Because Massachusetts\
      \ is on the East Coast, and Arizona is in the Southwest, so yes. For example,\
      \ the longitude of Cambridge, MA is around 71.1 degrees West. Tempe, AZ is around\
      \ 111.9 degrees West. Wait, no, wait\u2014longitude decreases as you go east.\
      \ So lower longitude numbers are further east. Wait, the prime meridian is 0\
      \ degrees, going west from there up to 180. So if Cambridge is 71.1\xB0W, and\
      \ Tempe is 111.9\xB0W, then Cambridge has a lower longitude number, which means\
      \ it's east of Tempe. Because lower longitude (more east) versus higher (more\
      \ west). \n\nSo since 71.1 is east of 111.9, that would mean Harvard is east\
      \ of Arizona State. So the answer would be yes. Let me double-check. Phoenix,\
      \ AZ is at about 112\xB0W, Boston is around 71\xB0W. So Boston is much further\

      \ right? And Harvard is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Cambridge is near Boston,\
      \ which is on the east coast of the United States. So Massachusetts is definitely\
      \ an eastern state.\n\nNow, Arizona State University is in Arizona, which is\
      \ a southwestern state. Arizona is known for cities like Phoenix and Tucson.\
      \ The state is in the Mountain Time Zone or maybe Pacific? Wait, no, Arizona\
      \ is mostly in the Mountain Time Zone, but doesn't observe Daylight Saving Time,\
      \ so sometimes it aligns with Pacific. But geographically, it's in the southwest.\n\
      \nNow, the key thing here is the longitude. The further east a location is,\
      \ the higher its longitude (in the western hemisphere, longitude decreases as\
      \ you go west). Wait, no\u2014actually, longitude lines run east-west, with\
      \ prime meridian at 0\xB0. So for the United States, which is west of the prime\
      \ meridian, the longitude values are negative. So the more east a place is,\
      \ the less negative (closer to zero) its longitude. For example, Boston is around\

      \ is in Massachusetts, right? Specifically, I think it's in Cambridge, which\
      \ is part of the Boston area. The Harvard Summer School is part of the university,\

      \ Meridian. So, for example, New York is around 74\xB0W, and Los Angeles is\
      \ around 118\xB0W. So a lower longitude (closer to 0) means further east. So\
      \ Massachusetts would have a lower longitude (more east) compared to Arizona.\n\
      \nWait, let me check that. Let's think: Boston, MA is approximately at 71\xB0\

      \ and then determine their relative positions, specifically which one is further\
      \ east.\n\nFirst, I should recall where each university is. Florida State University\
      \ (FSU) is in Florida, right? The main campus is in Tallahassee, the state capital.\
      \ And the University of Phoenix is in Arizona. Wait, but the University of Phoenix\
      \ is an online university, right? Do they have a physical campus? I think they\
      \ have several campuses, but their headquarters is in Phoenix, Arizona. So maybe\
      \ we're talking about the main campus or administrative location there.\n\n\
      So, the key here is comparing the longitude of Tallahassee, FL, and Phoenix,\
      \ AZ. Because longitude determines how far east or west a location is. The further\
      \ east a place is, the higher its longitude (if we're talking about the eastern\
      \ hemisphere), but wait, no\u2014in the western hemisphere, longitude is measured\
      \ west of the Prime Meridian. So, lower longitude values (more negative) are\
      \ further west in the US. Wait, no, longitude in the US is west longitude, so\
      \ it's measured as degrees west of the Prime Meridian. So, Phoenix, AZ, and\
      \ Tallahassee, FL, both are in the western hemisphere, so their longitudes are\
      \ west (negative if using decimal notation). The one with the smaller numerical\
      \ value (less negative) would be further east. For example, if Phoenix is at\
      \ around 112\xB0W and Tallahassee is around 84\xB0W, then Tallahassee is further\
      \ east because 84 is east of 112 (since lower numbers are east in west longitude).\n\
      \nWait, let me confirm the actual longitudes. Let me think. Phoenix, Arizona\
      \ is in the Mountain Time Zone, which is UTC-7, while Tallahassee, Florida is\

      \ Time is UTC-5, so that's 75 degrees west (since 5*15=75). Mountain Time is\
      \ UTC-7, so 105 degrees west. So Phoenix would be around 112\xB0W longitude?\
      \ Wait, maybe not exactly, but approximately. Tallahassee's longitude is around\
      \ 84.28\xB0W, according to my memory. Phoenix is around 112.07\xB0W. So comparing\
      \ 84.28\xB0W vs. 112.07\xB0W. Since 84.28 is less than 112.07, that means Tallahassee\

      \ even so, Florida as a whole is on the East Coast. Phoenix is in Arizona, which\
      \ is in the southwestern US. So geographically, Florida is definitely east of\
      \ Arizona. For example, the state of Florida is on the Atlantic side, while\
      \ Arizona is near the Pacific. So any point in Florida would be east of any\
      \ point in Arizona. Wait, is that true? Let me think. The US extends from approximately\
      \ 66\xB0W (east coast, like Maine) to around 124\xB0W (west coast, so so so\
      \ so so cities there have longitudes around 80-87\xB0W. Arizona is in the southwest,\
      \ so Phoenix is around 112\xB0W. So yes, Tallahassee at 84\xB0W is east of Phoenix\

      \ whether Florida State University in Florida is located east of the University\

      \ \n\nFlorida State University, as the name suggests, is in Florida. I know\
      \ that Florida is on the east coast of the United States, with the Atlantic\
      \ Ocean to the east and the Gulf of Mexico to the west. The main campus of Florida\
      \ State is in Tallahassee, which is the state capital. But where exactly is\
      \ Tallahassee? I think it's in the northern part of Florida, not too far from\
      \ the Georgia border. So the coordinates probably are something like 30 degrees\
      \ north latitude and 84 degrees west longitude, roughly. Maybe a bit different,\
      \ but that's the general area.\n\nNow the University of Phoenix, Arizona. The\
      \ main campus of the University of Phoenix is in Phoenix, Arizona. Arizona is\
      \ in the southwestern part of the US, right? Phoenix is the capital and largest\
      \ city there. The coordinates for Phoenix are approximately 33 degrees north\
      \ latitude and 112 degrees west longitude. Wait, no, maybe 33\xB0N, 112\xB0\
      W? Or is that a bit off? Let me recall. Phoenix is in the central part of Arizona.\
      \ The longitude for Phoenix should be around 112 degrees west. \n\nSo longitude\
      \ is the key here. The question is about east vs. west. Places with a smaller\
      \ longitude (closer to the prime meridian) are further east. Since the Earth\
      \ is divided into eastern and western hemispheres from the prime meridian (0\xB0\
      ) going east and west up to 180\xB0. So, a location with a longitude of, say,\
      \ 80\xB0W is more east than one at 112\xB0W. \n\nFlorida State in Tallahassee:\
      \ let's get precise. Looking up, Tallahassee's coordinates are approximately\
      \ 30.4383\xB0 N, 84.2807\xB0 W. Wait, is that correct? From memory, Tallahassee\
      \ is in the Florida Panhandle, which is the part that's closest to Alabama and\
      \ Georgia. So its longitude would indeed be around 84\xB0W. \n\nThe University\
      \ of Phoenix in Phoenix, Arizona, has coordinates around 33.4484\xB0 N, 112.0740\xB0\
      \ W. So Phoenix is at about 112\xB0W longitude. \n\nComparing 84\xB0W (Tallahassee)\
      \ to 112\xB0W (Phoenix). Since 84 is less than 112, that means Tallahassee is\
      \ east of Phoenix. Therefore, Florida State University in Florida is east of\

      \ east. Wait, no, longitude is measured from the prime meridian (0\xB0), which\
      \ goes through Greenwich, England. So as you go west from there, longitude decreases\
      \ until 180\xB0, and east increases. So in the US, all longitudes are west,\
      \ so they're negative if we use the convention where east is positive and west\
      \ is negative. For example, New York is around -74\xB0W, and Los Angeles is\
      \ around -118\xB0W. So the more westward a location is, the more negative (or\
      \ smaller) its longitude value.\n\nSo if I can find the longitude of Tallahassee\
      \ and Phoenix, whichever has the higher longitude (less negative) is further\
      \ east. Let me try to recall or estimate. Florida is on the east coast, so Tallahassee\
      \ is in the Florida panhandle. Phoenix is in Arizona, which is in the southwestern\
      \ US. So Arizona is west of Florida. Therefore, Phoenix would be west of Tallahassee.\
      \ So FSU in Tallahassee would be east of Phoenix, AZ. Therefore, the answer\
      \ should be YES.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm mixing up. Let's\
      \ think about the states. Arizona is in the Mountain Time Zone (except for the\
      \ Navajo Nation, which observes daylight saving), and Florida is in the Eastern\
      \ Time Zone. The time zones generally go from east to west: Eastern, Central,\
      \ Mountain, Pacific. So Eastern Time is ahead of Mountain Time by two hours.\
      \ So Florida is east of Arizona. Therefore, Tallahassee, FL is east of Phoenix,\
      \ AZ. So FSU is east of University of Phoenix. So the answer is YES.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe I should check approximate longitudes. Let's see. Tallahassee, FL: I\
      \ think it's around 84\xB0W longitude. Phoenix, AZ is around 112\xB0W. Wait,\
      \ no, that can't be. Wait, 84\xB0W is around Atlanta, Georgia. Let me think.\
      \ Florida extends further west. For example, the westernmost point in Florida\
      \ is around 87\xB0W (like Pensacola). Tallahassee is in the panhandle, so maybe\
      \ around 84\xB0W. Wait, maybe I should look up approximate longitudes. But since\
      \ I can't access the internet, I have to estimate.\n\nWait, the continental\
      \ US spans from approximately 67\xB0W in the east (Maine) to 124\xB0W in the\
      \ west (Washington state). Florida is on the eastern side. Tallahassee is in\
      \ the northern part of Florida, near the border with Georgia. So maybe around\
      \ 84\xB0W. Phoenix, Arizona is in the southwestern part of the US. Arizona's\
      \ longitude is around 112\xB0W. Wait, no, that's too far. For example, Los Angeles\
      \ is around 118\xB0W. Phoenix is east of LA, so maybe around 112\xB0W. Wait,\
      \ but let me think. The approximate longitude of Phoenix: Arizona is in the\
      \ Mountain Time Zone, which is UTC-7. The central meridian for Mountain Time\
      \ is 105\xB0W. But Phoenix is a bit west of that. Maybe around 112\xB0W? Hmm,\
      \ maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think of cities. Denver is at about 105\xB0W.\
      \ Las Vegas is around 115\xB0W. Phoenix is east of Las Vegas, so maybe around\
      \ 112\xB0W. So if Tallahassee is around 84\xB0W, then 84\xB0W is east of 112\xB0\
      W. Because lower longitude (more east) means further east. So yes, Tallahassee\
      \ is east of Phoenix. Therefore, FSU is east of University of Phoenix, AZ. So\
      \ the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine if Florida State University (FSU)\

    7fa39088-1da5-4b97-a29a-222515519922: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question\
      \ step by step. So, I need to figure out if Florida State University in Florida\
      \ is east of the University of Phoenix in Arizona. Hmm, okay. Let's start by\
      \ recalling where each of these states is located in the US. \n\nFirst, Florida\
      \ is on the southeastern coast of the United States. It's that peninsula that\
      \ sticks out into the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. The capital of\
      \ Florida is Tallahassee, and that's where Florida State University is located.\
      \ Now, Arizona is in the southwestern part of the US, right next to California\
      \ and New Mexico. The University of Phoenix is based in Phoenix, which is the\
      \ capital of Arizona. \n\nSo, the main question is about their relative positions\
      \ east-west. East and west are determined by longitude. Places with a higher\
      \ longitude (more to the east) are further east, but actually, wait, longitude\
      \ increases as you go west, right? No, wait, no. Let me get that straight. The\
      \ prime meridian is 0 degrees, and as you go east, longitude increases to 180\
      \ degrees east, and west longitude increases to 180 degrees west. But in the\
      \ context of the United States, all the longitudes are west of the prime meridian,\
      \ so they're measured in degrees west. So, a higher degree of west longitude\
      \ means further west. For example, Arizona is further west than Florida, so\
      \ Phoenix, AZ would have a higher west longitude than Tallahassee, FL.\n\nWait,\
      \ maybe I should just look up the approximate longitudes. But since I don't\
      \ have actual data here, I need to reason it out. Florida is on the east coast,\
      \ so cities there are around 80-85 degrees west longitude. For example, Miami\
      \ is around 80\xB0W. Tallahassee is in the northern part of Florida, so maybe\
      \ around 84\xB0W. Arizona is in the Mountain Time Zone, which is UTC-7, while\
      \ Florida is in Eastern Time, which is UTC-5. But time zones don't directly\
      \ translate to longitude, but they give a rough idea. Phoenix, AZ is at approximately\
      \ 112\xB0W longitude. That's much further west than Tallahassee. \n\nSo if Florida\
      \ State University is in Tallahassee at around 84\xB0W, and the University of\
      \ Phoenix is in Phoenix at around 112\xB0W, then Tallahassee is east of Phoenix\
      \ because 84\xB0W is a smaller number than 112\xB0W. The smaller the longitude\
      \ (when both are west), the further east it is. So yes, Florida State University\
      \ (FL) is east of University of Phoenix (AZ). Therefore, the answer should be\
      \ YES.\n</think>To determine if Florida State University (FL) is east of the\
      \ University of Phoenix (AZ):  \n1. **Florida State University** is located\
      \ in Tallahassee, FL, which lies at approximately **84.28\xB0W** longitude.\
      \  \n2. **University of Phoenix** (headquarters) is in Phoenix, AZ, situated\
      \ around **112.07\xB0W** longitude.  \n3. Since lower western longitude values\
      \ indicate positions further east, Tallahassee (84.28\xB0W) is east of Phoenix\
      \ (112.07\xB0W).  \n\n**ANSWER: YES**"
    8a1dc27c-18d6-491c-ae07-9536c1872128: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Florida State University in Florida is located east of the University\
      \ of Phoenix in Arizona. Hmm, I need to figure out the geographic locations\
      \ of both universities and then determine their longitudinal positions.\n\n\
      First, I know that Florida State University (FSU) is in Tallahassee, Florida.\
      \ The University of Phoenix, though, I'm a bit fuzzy on. Wait, the University\
      \ of Phoenix is an online university, but they have physical campuses too. The\
      \ main administrative office or a major campus might be in Arizona, maybe Phoenix,\
      \ as the name suggests. So the University of Phoenix, AZ would be in Phoenix,\
      \ Arizona.\n\nNow, I need to compare the longitude of Tallahassee, FL, and Phoenix,\
      \ AZ. Since the Earth is divided into east and west longitudes, with the prime\
      \ meridian at 0\xB0, locations to the west have west longitudes (negative if\
      \ using the -180 to +180 system), and east longitudes are positive. But in the\
      \ US, all longitudes are west, so they're negative. The more eastward a location\
      \ is, the less negative (higher numerically) its longitude. For example, the\
      \ East Coast of the US is around -75 to -80 degrees, while the West Coast is\
      \ around -120 to -115 degrees.\n\nSo, Tallahassee, FL: Let me recall. Florida\
      \ is in the southeastern US. Tallahassee is the capital, in the northern part\
      \ of Florida. Its longitude is approximately 84.28\xB0 West, which is -84.28\
      \ in decimal degrees.\n\nPhoenix, AZ: Arizona is in the Mountain Time Zone.\
      \ Phoenix's longitude is around 112.07\xB0 West, which is -112.07.\n\nComparing\
      \ the two, -84.28 (Tallahassee) is east of -112.07 (Phoenix) because as you\
      \ go east, the longitude becomes less negative. So, Tallahassee is east of Phoenix.\
      \ Therefore, Florida State University, FL is east of University of Phoenix,\
      \ AZ.\n\nWait, but I should double-check the longitudes to be sure. Let me confirm:\n\
      \nLooking up, Tallahassee, FL coordinates: approximately 30.4550\xB0 N, 84.2533\xB0\
      \ W.\n\nPhoenix, AZ coordinates: approximately 33.4484\xB0 N, 112.0740\xB0 W.\n\
      \nYes, so Tallahassee's longitude is -84.25, Phoenix is -112.07. Since -84.25\
      \ is greater (less negative) than -112.07, Tallahassee is indeed east of Phoenix.\
      \ Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \nFlorida State University in\
      \ Tallahassee, FL, has a longitude of approximately 84.25\xB0 W, while the University\
      \ of Phoenix's Phoenix, AZ, campus is around 112.07\xB0 W. Since lower numerical\
      \ values (less negative) in longitude indicate positions farther east, Tallahassee\
      \ is east of Phoenix. Thus, FSU is located east of the University of Phoenix,\
      \ AZ."
    9a492736-b281-4f3e-92dd-5581859bcd41: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Florida State University in Florida is east of the University of Phoenix in\
      \ Arizona. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably locate\
      \ where each university is. Florida State University (FSU) is in Florida, and\
      \ the University of Phoenix (UOP) is in Arizona. But I need to know the specific\
      \ cities because states can be large. \n\nI remember that FSU is in Tallahassee,\
      \ which is the capital of Florida. For the University of Phoenix, I think their\
      \ main campus is in Phoenix, Arizona. So, Tallahassee, FL vs. Phoenix, AZ.\n\
      \nNow, the question is about east direction. To determine if one place is east\
      \ of another, I need to compare their longitudes. Places with higher longitude\
      \ (more east) are further east. The prime meridian is 0\xB0, and longitude increases\
      \ moving east from there, but in the US, all longitudes are west of the prime\
      \ meridian, so they're negative numbers. So, actually, the more east a location\
      \ is, the less negative (closer to zero) its longitude is. Wait, no. Let me\
      \ think again. Longitude west of the prime meridian is measured in degrees west,\
      \ which are negative when using decimal degrees. For example, in the US, locations\
      \ have longitudes like -75\xB0, -112\xB0, etc. So, the further east you are\
      \ in the US, the closer the longitude is to -60 or something, while further\
      \ west would be more negative, like -120. So, if a place has a longitude of\
      \ -80, it's more east than a place at -110. So comparing Tallahassee's longitude\
      \ to Phoenix's.\n\nSo I need the exact longitudes. Let me recall or approximate.\
      \ Florida is on the east coast, so its longitude would be around, say, Tallahassee\
      \ is in the Florida Panhandle. Maybe around 84\xB0W? Phoenix is in Arizona,\
      \ which is Mountain Time Zone. Mountain Time is UTC-7, and Florida is Eastern\
      \ Time, UTC-5. But time zones can vary in boundaries. Anyway, Phoenix's longitude\
      \ is around 112\xB0W? Wait, no. Wait, Arizona is in the Mountain Time Zone but\
      \ doesn't observe daylight saving time except for the Navajo Nation. But maybe\
      \ I'm mixing up cities. Let me think: Phoenix, Arizona's longitude is approximately\
      \ 112 degrees west? Wait, no, that's too far west. Let's think: The continental\
      \ US spans from approximately 67\xB0W (east coast, like Maine) to around 125\xB0\
      W (west coast, like Washington state). Florida is on the eastern side. Tallahassee\
      \ is in the northern part of Florida, so maybe around 84\xB0W. Phoenix, Arizona,\
      \ is in the southwestern part. Los Angeles is about 118\xB0W, so Phoenix is\
      \ east of LA. Maybe Phoenix is around 112\xB0W? Wait, let me get more precise.\
      \ \n\nAlternatively, refer to known coordinates. Let's recall: Tallahassee,\
      \ FL coordinates: Approximately 30.4550\xB0 N, 84.2533\xB0 W. Phoenix, AZ coordinates:\
      \ Approximately 33.4484\xB0 N, 112.0740\xB0 W. Wait, but wait, that can't be.\
      \ Because Phoenix is in Arizona, which is Mountain Standard Time, which is UTC-7.\
      \ The longitude for Mountain Time is roughly centered around 105\xB0W. For example,\
      \ Denver is at 105\xB0W. Phoenix is a bit west of Denver. Let me check. Wait,\
      \ no, maybe I'm confusing. Let me think again. Google's coordinates for Phoenix,\
      \ AZ: 33.4484\xB0 N, 112.0740\xB0 W. Wait, that would mean Phoenix is at 112\xB0\
      W, which is more west than Denver (105\xB0W). That's correct? Because Arizona\
      \ is in the Mountain Time Zone but perhaps more to the west. So if Tallahassee\
      \ is at 84\xB0W and Phoenix is 112\xB0W, then Tallahassee is east of Phoenix\
      \ because 84\xB0W is less west than 112\xB0W. In other words, locations with\
      \ lower numerical longitude (less west) are further east. Since 84\xB0W is closer\
      \ to the prime meridian than 112\xB0W, Tallahassee is east of Phoenix. Therefore,\
      \ Florida State University is east of University of Phoenix. \n\nWait, but the\
      \ University of Phoenix has multiple campuses, right? The question says \"located\
      \ east of University of Phoenix, AZ\". So assuming the main campus in Phoenix,\
      \ AZ. The coordinates for the University of Phoenix's Phoenix campus would be\
      \ same as Phoenix, AZ. So yes, Tallahassee is east of Phoenix. Hence, FSU is\
      \ east of UOP in AZ. So the answer is YES.\n</think>To determine if Florida\
      \ State University (FSU) in Tallahassee, FL, is east of the University of Phoenix\

      W**  \n\nSince **84.25\xB0W is closer to the prime meridian (0\xB0)** than 112.07\xB0\
      W, Tallahassee lies east of Phoenix.  \n\n**ANSWER: YES**"
    9b1f6121-3375-4125-835e-f2174fce477d: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Florida State University in Florida is located east of the University\

      \nFirst, I should find out where each university is. Florida State University\
      \ (FSU) is in Florida. The main campus is in Tallahassee, I think. Then the\

      \ So Phoenix, AZ is at approximately 112 degrees west longitude. Tallahassee,\

      \ to the west, bordering Alabama. So Tallahassee is actually in the panhandle,\
      \ which is the western part of Florida. So perhaps Tallahassee is around 84\xB0\
      W, while Miami is around 80\xB0W. So comparing the two:\n\nTallahassee, FL:\
      \ approx 84.28\xB0W (source: quick recall)\nPhoenix, AZ: approx 112.07\xB0W\
      \ (source: same)\n\nWait, but longitude west is measured as negative in decimal\

      \ Florida State University in Florida is east of the University of Phoenix in\
      \ Arizona. Let's start by recalling where these states are located geographically.\
      \ \n\nFlorida is on the southeastern coast of the United States, right? The\
      \ state is known for being a peninsula that sticks out into the Atlantic Ocean\
      \ and the Gulf of Mexico. The capital of Florida is Tallahassee, which is where\
      \ Florida State University is located. \n\nArizona, on the other hand, is in\
      \ the southwestern part of the U.S. It's known for deserts and the Grand Canyon.\
      \ The University of Phoenix is an online university, but I think their headquarters\
      \ or main campus is in Phoenix, Arizona. So I should consider Phoenix, AZ as\
      \ the location for the University of Phoenix.\n\nNow, the question is about\
      \ which is more east. Since Florida is on the east coast and Arizona is in the\
      \ southwest, I would guess that Florida is east of Arizona. But I should check\
      \ the exact longitudes to be sure because sometimes states can have parts that\
      \ are more east or west than others. \n\nLongitude measures how far east or\
      \ west a location is. The Prime Meridian is 0 degrees, and in the U.S., locations\
      \ have west longitude (since they're west of the Prime Meridian). So a smaller\
      \ longitude number (more negative) would be further east, and a higher number\
      \ (closer to zero) would be further west. Wait, no, actually, in the US, the\
      \ longitude is west, so it's measured in degrees west from the Prime Meridian.\
      \ So, for example, a longitude of 84 degrees West is further east than 112 degrees\
      \ West because 84 is a smaller number (less west). \n\nLet me confirm: If one\
      \ place is at 84\xB0W and another at 112\xB0W, the one at 84\xB0W is further\
      \ east since it's closer to the Prime Meridian. So, the longitude of Tallahassee,\

      \ Phoenix is in Arizona, which is Mountain Time (except for the Navajo Nation),\
      \ but its longitude. Let me check approximate longitude of Phoenix, AZ. A quick\
      \ search in my mind\u2014Phoenix is at approximately 112 degrees west longitude?\
      \ Wait, maybe it's closer to 112. So if FSU is at 84\xB0W and Phoenix is at\

      W. \n\nWait, but maybe my memory is off. Let me make sure: For example, the\

      \ I might be incorrect. Let me recall that the approximate longitude for Phoenix.\
      \ Let's think of other cities. For example, Denver is around 105\xB0W, Salt\
      \ Lake City is around 111\xB0W. So Phoenix, being in Arizona, which is west\
      \ of New Mexico (which is around 106\xB0W longitude for Albuquerque), so perhaps\
      \ Phoenix is around 112\xB0W. Alternatively, maybe it's a bit less. Wait, maybe\
      \ 112\xB0W is too far. Let me think of the coordinates for Phoenix. Checking\
      \ my memory, Phoenix, AZ is at approximately 33.45\xB0N latitude, 112.07\xB0\
      W longitude. Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Wait, I think I might be mixing\
      \ up with another city. Let me think again. For example, Tucson, AZ is at 110.97\xB0\
      W. So Phoenix, being north of Tucson, would have a slightly higher longitude?\
      \ Or wait, longitude increases as you go east to west. Wait, no: longitude measures\
      \ east or west from the Prime Meridian. So moving west from the Prime Meridian,\
      \ longitude increases in the west direction. So cities in the western US have\
      \ higher west longitude values. So if Tucson is at about 111\xB0W, maybe Phoenix\
      \ is a bit more west. Wait, but Phoenix is to the northwest of Tucson. Let me\
      \ check: Phoenix's coordinates are approximately 33.4484\xB0 N, 112.0740\xB0\
      \ W. Wait, so that's 112.074\xB0W. So yes, Phoenix is around 112\xB0W. \n\n\
      Tallahassee, FL's coordinates are approximately 30.4383\xB0 N, 84.2807\xB0 W.\
      \ So 84.28\xB0W. \n\nComparing the two longitudes: Tallahassee is at 84.28\xB0\
      W, Phoenix at 112.07\xB0W. Since 84.28\xB0W is a smaller number (closer to the\
      \ Prime Meridian) than 112.07\xB0W, Tallahassee is east of Phoenix. Therefore,\

      \ is around 112.07\xB0 West, which is -112.07. Comparing these two, since -84.28\
      \ is more east than -112.07 (because -84.28 is closer to zero), that means Tallahassee\

      \ the East Coast, New York City is south of Boston and north of Philadelphia.\
      \ So New York is between them. Wait, no. Wait, Philadelphia is south of New\
      \ York City, and Boston is north of New York. So in terms of east-west, are\
      \ they aligned differently? Let me think about their longitudes. \n\nLongitude\
      \ measures how far east or west a location is. The higher the longitude (in\
      \ the US, since it's west of the prime meridian), the more west it is. Wait,\
      \ no. Actually, in the US, all longitudes are west, so they're negative numbers.\
      \ So a smaller longitude (more negative) would be further west. Wait, no. Wait,\
      \ longitude is measured from 0\xB0 at the prime meridian (Greenwich, UK) going\
      \ east to 180\xB0 and west to -180\xB0. So in the US, all longitudes are negative\
      \ when expressed in the western hemisphere. So for example, New York City is\
      \ around -74\xB0 longitude, Boston is around -71\xB0, and Philadelphia is around\
      \ -75\xB0. Wait, is that right? Let me check my memory. \n\nWait, I think Boston\
      \ is further east. Because if you look at the map, Boston is on the coast of\
      \ Massachusetts, which juts out more into the Atlantic compared to Philadelphia.\
      \ Philadelphia is along the Delaware River, which is a bit inland. So Boston's\
      \ longitude should be more eastward, meaning a less negative (or higher) value\
      \ than Philadelphia's. \n\nFor example, if Boston is around -71\xB0 longitude\
      \ and Philadelphia is around -75\xB0, then Boston is east of Philadelphia because\
      \ -71 is east of -75 (since each degree west is more negative). So yes, Boston\
      \ (Northeastern) would be east of Philadelphia (UPenn). \n\nBut wait, maybe\
      \ I have the longitudes mixed up. Let me try to recall specific coordinates.\
      \ The University of Pennsylvania's coordinates are approximately 39.9522\xB0\
      \ N, 75.1932\xB0 W. So longitude is -75.1932. Northeastern University is in\
      \ Boston, which has coordinates approximately 42.3398\xB0 N, 71.0892\xB0 W.\
      \ So longitude is -71.0892. \n\nComparing the two longitudes: -71.0892 (Northeastern)\
      \ vs. -75.1932 (UPenn). Since -71 is less negative than -75, that means Northeastern\
      \ is further east. Because in terms of west longitude, a smaller numerical value\
      \ (closer to zero) is more east. So yes, Northeastern University in MA is east\
      \ of the University of Pennsylvania in PA.\n</think>YES  \nNortheastern University\
      \ in Boston, MA (longitude \u2248 -71.09\xB0 W) is east of the University of\
      \ Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA (longitude \u2248 -75.19\xB0 W). Since -71.09\xB0\
      \ is less negative (closer to the prime meridian) than -75.19\xB0, Boston lies\
      \ further east than Philadelphia."
    cabd54f3-52bc-4f95-9304-1f3a77af6332: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Northeastern University in Massachusetts is east of the University of Pennsylvania\
      \ in Pennsylvania. Let's start by recalling where these two states are. \n\n\
      First, Massachusetts is in the New England region of the northeastern United\
      \ States. Its major city is Boston, and I think Northeastern University is located\
      \ in Boston. Pennsylvania is a bit to the south and west of Massachusetts. The\
      \ University of Pennsylvania is in Philadelphia, which is a major city in southeastern\
      \ Pennsylvania.\n\nNow, I need to compare the longitudinal positions of Boston\
      \ and Philadelphia. Longitude measures how far east or west a location is. If\
      \ Boston has a higher longitude (more east) than Philadelphia, then Northeastern\
      \ would be east of UPenn. Wait, but longitude in the US increases as you go\
      \ west because the prime meridian is in Greenwich, England. Wait, no\u2014actually,\
      \ longitude in the eastern US would be negative numbers because they are west\
      \ of the prime meridian. So, for example, Boston's longitude is around -71 degrees,\
      \ and Philadelphia is around -75 degrees. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting that mixed\
      \ up. Let me think. The prime meridian is 0 degrees, and as you go west, the\
      \ longitude becomes negative in the western hemisphere. So Boston is at approximately\
      \ 71 degrees west, which would be -71, and Philadelphia is around 75 degrees\
      \ west (-75). Wait, but that can't be right because moving west from the prime\
      \ meridian, the longitude increases in the negative direction. So if Boston\
      \ is at -71 and Philadelphia is at -75, then Boston is actually east of Philadelphia\
      \ because -71 is a smaller number (less west) than -75. So, higher numerical\
      \ value (without considering the negative) would mean further west. So, since\
      \ -75 is more west than -71, Philadelphia is west of Boston. Therefore, Boston\
      \ (Northeastern) is east of Philadelphia (UPenn). \n\nWait, but let me confirm\
      \ the actual coordinates. Let me recall: Boston, MA is indeed located at approximately\
      \ 42.36\xB0 N latitude, -71.06\xB0 W longitude. Philadelphia, PA is around 39.95\xB0\
      \ N latitude, -75.16\xB0 W longitude. Comparing the longitudes: -71.06 vs. -75.16.\
      \ Since longitude becomes more negative as you go west, a less negative value\
      \ (closer to zero) means further east. Therefore, -71.06 is east of -75.16.\
      \ So Boston is east of Philadelphia, which means Northeastern University (in\
      \ Boston) is east of the University of Pennsylvania (in Philadelphia). Therefore,\
      \ the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \nNortheastern University in Boston, MA (longitude\
      \ ~-71.06\xB0 W) is east of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia,\
      \ PA (longitude ~-75.16\xB0 W). Since -71.06\xB0 is less west than -75.16\xB0\
      , Boston lies east of Philadelphia. Thus, the answer is YES."

      \ So, the user is asking if Northeastern University in Massachusetts is located\

      \ I think Boston is around 42 degrees north latitude and 71 degrees west longitude.\
      \ Let me confirm that. Yeah, Boston is roughly at 42.36\xB0 N, 71.06\xB0 W.\n\
      \nNow, the University of Pennsylvania. That's in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\
      \ Philadelphia is another big city, but where exactly is it located? From what\
      \ I remember, Philly is south of New York City. Its coordinates are approximately\
      \ 39.95\xB0 N, 75.17\xB0 W. So latitude-wise, Philly is south of Boston. But\
      \ the question is about east vs. west. \n\nLongitude is the key here because\
      \ east and west are determined by longitude. The lower the longitude number\
      \ (more negative in the western hemisphere), the further west it is. So Boston\
      \ is at about 71\xB0 W, and Philly is at 75\xB0 W. Wait, but longitude west\
      \ means that as the number increases, you go further west. So 75\xB0 W is actually\
      \ further west than 71\xB0 W. So if Northeastern (Boston) is at 71\xB0 W and\
      \ UPenn (Philly) is at 75\xB0 W, then Boston is east of Philly. Because 71 is\
      \ less than 75, meaning Boston is to the east. \n\nLet me double-check that.\
      \ Imagine looking at a map of the US East Coast. Boston is in the northeast,\

      \nI remember that Boston is north of Philadelphia, but I'm not sure about the\
      \ east-west positioning. Maybe I should look up the approximate longitudes of\
      \ both cities. Longitude measures how far east or west a place is from the prime\

      \ Western Hemisphere.\n\nWait, but in the US, which is in the Western Hemisphere,\

      \ no\u2014actually, longitude in the US is west longitude, so for example, Boston\

      \ If that's the case, Boston would be east of Philadelphia because 71\xB0W is\

      \ -71 degrees. So Boston is actually east of NYC because -71 is less west than\
      \ -74. \n\nSyracuse is in upstate New York. Let me try to remember the approximate\

      \ \n\nWait, if MIT is in Cambridge, MA, which is part of the Boston area. Boston's\
      \ coordinates are approximately 42.36\xB0 N, 71.06\xB0 W. Syracuse, NY is in\
      \ central New York. Let me think, Syracuse is west of Albany, which is the capital\
      \ of NY. Albany is around 42.65\xB0 N, 73.76\xB0 W. Syracuse is further west\
      \ than Albany. So if Albany is at about 73.76\xB0 W, Syracuse would be more\
      \ west, maybe around 76\xB0 W. \n\nSo MIT is at around 71\xB0 W, Syracuse at\
      \ 76\xB0 W. Since longitude west is measured as negative, 71\xB0 W is -71, and\
      \ 76\xB0 W is -76. The more eastward location would have the higher longitude\
      \ (less negative). So -71 is higher than -76. Therefore, MIT is east of Syracuse.\
      \ \n\nWait, but let me confirm the exact coordinates. Maybe I should look up\
      \ the exact longitudes. But since I can't access the internet, I have to rely\
      \ on my memory. Boston is on the east coast, so it's more east. Syracuse is\
      \ in upstate New York, which is more inland. So yes, Boston (and MIT) would\
      \ be east of Syracuse. \n\nSo the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \nMassachusetts\
      \ Institute of Technology (MIT) is located in Cambridge, MA, near Boston, with\
      \ a longitude of approximately 71.06\xB0 W. Syracuse University in Syracuse,\
      \ NY, has a longitude of around 76.14\xB0 W. Since lower numerical values (less\
      \ negative) in longitude indicate a more easterly position in the Western Hemisphere,\
      \ MIT (71.06\xB0 W) is east of Syracuse University (76.14\xB0 W)."

      \ in Massachusetts is east of Syracuse University in New York. First, I need\
      \ to know where each of these schools is located. \n\nMIT is in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\
      \ Syracuse University is in Syracuse, New York. Now, I need to compare their\
      \ geographical positions, specifically their longitude, since east-west direction\
      \ is determined by longitude. Places with a higher longitude (more east) are\
      \ further east.\n\nWait, but longitude increases as you go east from the prime\
      \ meridian. So, if MIT's longitude is higher than Syracuse's, then it's further\
      \ east. Let me check their coordinates. \n\nLooking up Cambridge, MA: I recall\
      \ it's near Boston, which is on the east coast of Massachusetts. Syracuse, NY\
      \ is in central New York State, more inland. From a map perspective, Boston\
      \ is definitely east of Syracuse. But let me confirm with actual coordinates.\n\
      \nQuick search: MIT's coordinates are approximately 42.3601\xB0 N, 71.0942\xB0\
      \ W. Syracuse University is around 43.0377\xB0 N, 76.1320\xB0 W. Wait, longitude\

      \ in negative degrees if we consider the standard where east is positive. However,\
      \ when comparing, a smaller numerical value in the west longitude means it's\
      \ further east because it's closer to the prime meridian. For example, -70 is\
      \ east of -75 because -70 is closer to 0.\n\nSo, MIT at 71.0942\xB0 W is actually\
      \ less west than Syracuse at 76.1320\xB0 W. So, MIT is east of Syracuse because\

      \ The question is whether Cambridge, MA, is east of Syracuse, NY.\n\nWait, let\
      \ me get their approximate coordinates. Maybe I can visualize a map of the northeastern\
      \ US. Boston is on the east coast, so Massachusetts is definitely towards the\
      \ east. New York State is west of Massachusetts. But Syracuse is in upstate\
      \ New York, not in New York City. So where exactly is Syracuse located? It's\
      \ in central New York, maybe a bit north. Boston is east of upstate New York,\
      \ right? Because when you go from New York State towards the east, you enter\
      \ Massachusetts. So Boston (and Cambridge) would be east of Syracuse. Let me\
      \ think again. If you look at a map, Syracuse is in the middle part of New York\
      \ State. The longitude lines run north-south. The further east a place is, the\
      \ higher the longitude (if we're talking west longitude). Wait, no, longitude\

      \ longitude (more west) than Syracuse, then it's west. Wait, no, longitude in\
      \ the US is west longitude, so larger numbers are further west. Wait, that's\
      \ confusing. Let me think.\n\nFor example, New York City is around 74 degrees\
      \ west longitude. Boston is around 71 degrees west. So Boston is east of NYC\

      \ or west compared to MIT?\n\nCambridge, MA is near Boston, which is on the\
      \ eastern coast. Syracuse is in central New York. Let me think about the longitude.\
      \ Places further east have higher longitude values if we're using the western\
      \ hemisphere where longitudes are negative. Wait, longitude in the US is typically\
      \ west longitude, so more eastward locations would have a less negative (closer\

      \ Syracuse, NY is around 76 degrees west. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the\

      \ Syracuse is west of NYC, so Syracuse's longitude would be higher in numerical\

      \ is measured west from the Prime Meridian. So cities on the east coast have\
      \ more easterly longitudes (closer to zero or less negative) compared to those\
      \ further west. Wait, no, actually, in the western hemisphere, longitude is\
      \ west, so it's measured as degrees west, which would be negative values. For\
      \ example, New York City is around 74 degrees west, which is -74. Boston is\
      \ around -71. So Boston is east of NYC because -71 is east of -74 (since moving\

      \ First, I need to figure out the locations of both places.\n\nLet me start\
      \ with Duke University. I know Duke is in North Carolina. The main campus is\
      \ in Durham, NC. Now, where exactly is Durham? North Carolina is on the East\
      \ Coast of the United States, right? So Durham should be in the eastern part\
      \ of the country. But I should confirm the exact longitude to be sure.\n\nThen,\
      \ the University of Michigan College of Engineering. The University of Michigan's\
      \ main campus is in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The College of Engineering is part\
      \ of that main campus. Now, Michigan is in the Midwest, near the Great Lakes.\
      \ Specifically, Ann Arbor is in the southeastern part of Michigan, close to\
      \ Detroit. \n\nNext, I need to compare their longitudes because east and west\
      \ are determined by longitude. The further east a location is, the higher its\
      \ longitude (if we're considering the eastern hemisphere, but in the US, all\
      \ longitudes are west, so actually, a lower longitude value means further east).\
      \ Wait, no, longitude in the US is measured as west of the prime meridian. So,\
      \ for example, New York City is around 74\xB0W, and Los Angeles is around 118\xB0\
      W. So the lower the longitude number (more east), the further east the location\
      \ is.\n\nSo, I need to find the longitude of Durham, NC, and Ann Arbor, MI.\
      \ Let me recall or estimate. Durham, NC: I think North Carolina's longitude\
      \ is around 78-79\xB0W. For example, Raleigh, the capital, is about 78.64\xB0\
      W. Durham is nearby, so probably similar. Ann Arbor, MI: Michigan's southeastern\

      \ 83.05\xB0W, and Ann Arbor is west of Detroit, so maybe around 83.7\xB0W or\
      \ so. \n\nIf Durham is around 78\xB0W and Ann Arbor is around 83\xB0W, then\
      \ Durham is east of Ann Arbor because 78 is less than 83 (since both are west\

      \ I'm not mixing up the directions. Since both are in the western hemisphere,\

      \ Ann Arbor, MI. Since the Earth is divided into east and west by the Prime\

      \ at their longitudinal coordinates. The more eastward a location is, the higher\
      \ its longitude value (in the western hemisphere, longitudes are negative, so\
      \ a less negative number is more east). \n\nWait, longitude for the US is west\
      \ of the Prime Meridian, so they'll be in the negative degrees. Let me confirm\
      \ that. Yes, for the contiguous US, longitudes are west, so represented as negative\
      \ numbers when using the decimal degree system (e.g., -70 degrees would be 70\
      \ degrees west).\n\nSo, I need to find the longitude of Durham, NC, and Ann\
      \ Arbor, MI. The one with the higher longitude (closer to zero, less negative)\
      \ is further east. Because moving east in the US means moving towards less negative\
      \ longitude.\n\nLet me look up the approximate longitudes. From memory or general\
      \ knowledge, Michigan is further west than North Carolina. But maybe I should\
      \ be precise. \n\nDuke University in Durham, NC: I think Durham is in the central\
      \ part of North Carolina. North Carolina is on the East Coast, but not the farthest.\
      \ Its longitude might be around -78 degrees or something. \n\nUniversity of\
      \ Michigan in Ann Arbor: Ann Arbor is in southeastern Michigan. Michigan as\
      \ a state is in the Midwest. Its longitude would be more west than North Carolina.\
      \ Maybe around -83 degrees?\n\nWait, let me recall. For example, Detroit, MI\
      \ has a longitude of about -83.05. Ann Arbor is west of Detroit, so maybe around\
      \ -83.7 or so? While Durham, NC's longitude is approximately -78.9. \n\nIf that's\
      \ the case, then Durham's longitude is -78.9, which is east (since -78.9 is\
      \ more east than -83.7). Therefore, Duke University in NC would be east of the\
      \ University of Michigan College of Engineering in MI.\n\nSo, the answer should\
      \ be YES.\n</think>To determine if Duke University, NC is east of the University\

      \ So I need to compare their longitudes because east vs. west is determined\

      \ west to east, the longitude decreases because the US is in the western hemisphere,\
      \ so longitude is measured west of the prime meridian. Wait, no, longitude can\

      \ I need to know where these two places are located geographically.\n\nSo, starting\
      \ with Duke University. I know Duke is in Durham, North Carolina. I remember\
      \ that North Carolina is on the East Coast of the United States, right? Its\
      \ major cities include Charlotte and Raleigh. Now, the University of Michigan\
      \ College of Engineering is part of the University of Michigan, which is in\
      \ Ann Arbor, Michigan. Michigan is a state in the Midwest, near the Great Lakes.\
      \ \n\nNow, to determine east-west positioning, I should compare their longitudes.\
      \ Places with higher longitude values are further east. Wait, no, longitude\

      \ longitude (more eastward), it's further east. Let me check approximate longitudes.\n\
      \nDurham, NC: I think Durham is around 78.9 degrees West longitude. Wait, but\
      \ longitude west of the prime meridian is negative if we use the standard coordinate\
      \ system where east is positive. So maybe Durham is approximately -78.9. \n\n\
      Ann Arbor, MI: I believe Ann Arbor is around 83.7 degrees West longitude, so\
      \ that would be -83.7. \n\nComparing the two, -78.9 (Duke) is east of -83.7\
      \ (Michigan) because -78.9 is a larger number (less negative) than -83.7. So\
      \ if you convert them to positive, 78.9\xB0W vs. 83.7\xB0W. Since 78.9 is less\
      \ than 83.7, that means Durham is east of Ann Arbor. Wait, maybe I confused\
      \ that. Let me think again. \n\nLongitude lines go from 0\xB0 at Greenwich,\
      \ increasing east and west up to 180\xB0. But when using west longitudes, the\
      \ more west you go, the higher the number (but as a negative, it's lower numerically).\
      \ For example, 80\xB0W is 80 degrees west, which is further west than 75\xB0\
      W. So in terms of decimal degrees, if we consider negative values, Ann Arbor\
      \ is at a more negative longitude (-83.7) than Durham (-78.9). The more negative\
      \ the longitude, the further west it is. Therefore, Durham, being less negative\
      \ (i.e., closer to the prime meridian) is east of Ann Arbor. \n\nAlternatively,\
      \ if you think in terms of absolute degrees west, 83.7\xB0W is further west\
      \ than 78.9\xB0W. So Duke at 78.9\xB0W is east of Michigan at 83.7\xB0W. \n\n\

      \ are west (negative if using the coordinate system where east is positive).\
      \ For example, New York City is around 74\xB0W, and Chicago is around 87\xB0\

      \ west, meaning the values are negative when expressed in decimal degrees. For\
      \ example, New York City is around 74\xB0W, which is -74 degrees. Los Angeles\
      \ is around 118\xB0W (-118 degrees). So, the more west you go (towards California),\

      \ in Maryland has a longitude that's less west (i.e., a smaller number in negative\
      \ terms) than Stanford's, then it is indeed east of Stanford.\n\nLet me check\
      \ the approximate longitudes. Baltimore, MD: I think it's around 76.6\xB0W (so\
      \ -76.6). Stanford, CA: I believe Palo Alto (where Stanford is) is around 122.1\xB0\
      W (-122.1). Comparing -76.6 and -122.1, -76.6 is more east because it's closer\

      \ 76.6\xB0W longitude) is located east of Stanford University in California\
      \ (approximately 122.1\xB0W longitude). Since lower numerical values in western\
      \ longitudes indicate positions further east, Maryland's longitude is less west\
      \ (more east) than California's."

    5ed65021-da02-4054-ba7a-d4d7dce5d03a: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Johns Hopkins University in Maryland is east of Stanford University in California.\
      \ Hmm, let me start by recalling where these two universities are located. \n\
      \nJohns Hopkins University is in Maryland. I know Maryland is on the East Coast\
      \ of the United States. Cities like Baltimore and Annapolis are there, and the\
      \ state capital is Annapolis. Maryland is near Washington D.C., which is also\
      \ on the East Coast. So JHU is definitely in the eastern part of the US.\n\n\
      Stanford University is in California, specifically in the northern part near\
      \ San Francisco. California is on the West Coast. So Stanford is in the western\
      \ part of the US. \n\nNow, the question is whether the East Coast location (Maryland)\
      \ is east of the West Coast location (California). Since the US spans from the\
      \ Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific Ocean on the west, all the East\
      \ Coast states are to the east of the West Coast states. \n\nBut wait, just\
      \ to be thorough, maybe I should check the longitudes. The further east a location\
      \ is, the higher its longitude (in the western hemisphere, longitudes are negative,\
      \ so actually a lower numerical value). Wait, no, longitude degrees increase\
      \ as you go east, but in the US, which is west of the prime meridian, the longitude\
      \ is measured in degrees west, so they're negative. So for example, New York\
      \ might be around -74 degrees, while San Francisco is around -122 degrees. Since\
      \ -74 is greater (less negative) than -122, New York is east of San Francisco.\
      \ \n\nSo Maryland's longitude: let's say Baltimore, where JHU is. Baltimore\
      \ is approximately at 76.6 degrees west longitude, which is -76.6. Stanford's\
      \ location in California is around -122.2 degrees (longitude of Palo Alto, where\
      \ Stanford is, is roughly 122.1 west, so -122.1). Comparing these numbers, -76.6\
      \ is more east than -122.1 because -76.6 is a higher number (less west). So\
      \ yes, Johns Hopkins in Maryland is east of Stanford in California. \n\nTherefore,\
      \ the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \nJohns Hopkins University in Maryland\
      \ is on the East Coast, while Stanford University in California is on the West\

      \ \u2248 -76.6\xB0 vs. California's \u2248 -122.1\xB0), Johns Hopkins is indeed\
      \ east of Stanford.  \n\n**Answer:** YES"

      \ Wisconsin is in the Midwest, near the Great Lakes, while California is on\

      \ their longitudes. The further east a location is (higher longitude in the\
      \ western hemisphere?), wait no, actually longitude increases as you go east,\
      \ but the US is in the western hemisphere, so longitude is measured west from\
      \ the prime meridian. So, lower longitude numbers (more west) would be further\
      \ west, and higher numbers (more east) would be further east. Wait, no, actually,\
      \ in the western hemisphere, longitude is measured as west longitude. So, for\

      \ around 89 degrees West. Wait, but when considering east vs west, a lower number\
      \ (closer to 0) in the west longitude means it's further east. Because 89W is\

    0bbdf290-6d21-4639-8955-0c0cdeb9734c: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison College of Engineering in Wisconsin\
      \ is located east of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in California.\
      \ Let me start by recalling the locations of these two universities. \n\nFirst,\
      \ the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison (UW-Madison) is in Madison, Wisconsin.\
      \ I know Wisconsin is a state in the Midwest, probably somewhere in the northern\
      \ part of the US. Then UCLA is in Los Angeles, California, which is on the West\
      \ Coast. \n\nI need to determine their relative east-west positions. Generally,\
      \ states on the East Coast are east of the Midwest, which in turn are east of\
      \ the West Coast. But wait, the Midwest is more central. Let me think about\
      \ the US map. The West Coast includes California, Oregon, Washington. The Midwest\
      \ includes states like Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan. So California is on the\
      \ western side, and Wisconsin is more towards the center but still east of California.\
      \ \n\nWait, but does that mean Wisconsin is east of California? Because California\
      \ is on the west, and Wisconsin is towards the east relative to California.\
      \ So if I compare the longitude of Madison, WI, and Los Angeles, CA, the one\
      \ with the higher longitude would be more east. Wait, longitude increases as\
      \ you go east, right? Or is it the other way around? No, longitude is measured\
      \ from the prime meridian. So for the US, which is west of the prime meridian,\
      \ all longitudes are west (negative if using the -180 to +180 system). So Los\
      \ Angeles is around 118 degrees West longitude, and Madison, WI, is around 89\
      \ degrees West. Since 89 is less than 118 in terms of west longitude (because\
      \ it's more east), that would mean Madison is east of Los Angeles. \n\nLet me\
      \ confirm that. Longitude lines run north-south, and longitude values decrease\
      \ as you move east (towards the prime meridian). So Los Angeles, CA, has a longitude\
      \ of approximately 118\xB0W, while Madison, WI, is around 89\xB0W. Since 89\xB0\
      W is a smaller number than 118\xB0W, Madison is east of Los Angeles. Therefore,\

      \ Since lower west longitude values are farther east, Madison is east of Los\
      \ Angeles. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    22c40704-d636-4d36-a8b9-2294cdf93358: "<think>Okay, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, I need to figure out if the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison College\
      \ of Engineering in Wisconsin is located east of the University of California,\
      \ Los Angeles in California. Hmm. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\
      \nFirst, I should probably locate both universities on a map. Let's start with\
      \ their states. The University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison is in Wisconsin, which\
      \ is in the Midwest region of the United States. On the other hand, UCLA is\
      \ in Los Angeles, California, which is on the West Coast. Just knowing their\
      \ states, I can already get a rough idea. The Midwest is generally east of the\
      \ West Coast, but I need to be more precise.\n\nWait, but states can be large.\
      \ For example, California is a big state, stretching a lot from north to south,\
      \ and Wisconsin is in the northern part of the Midwest. Let me think about their\
      \ exact locations. Madison, Wisconsin is the capital city of Wisconsin. If I\
      \ recall, Wisconsin is just west of Lake Michigan, bordering states like Minnesota\
      \ to the west, Iowa to the southwest, and Illinois to the south. So Madison\
      \ is in the southern part of Wisconsin. \n\nUCLA is in Los Angeles, which is\
      \ in Southern California, right near the coast. So, Los Angeles is on the Pacific\
      \ Ocean. Now, comparing their longitudes. Since the US spans from east to west,\
      \ the further east a location is, the higher its longitude (wait, no, longitude\
      \ is measured from the prime meridian, so actually, in the US, all longitudes\
      \ are west, so they're negative numbers. So a more easterly point in the US\
      \ would have a less negative longitude, meaning closer to zero. For example,\
      \ New York is around -74 degrees, while Los Angeles is around -118 degrees.\
      \ So the higher the number (less negative), the more east it is.)\n\nSo, if\
      \ I can find the approximate longitude of Madison, WI and compare it to that\
      \ of Los Angeles, CA, I can determine which is further east.\n\nLet me try to\
      \ recall or estimate. Madison, Wisconsin: I think it's somewhere around 89 degrees\
      \ west longitude. Let me check that mentally. Chicago is around 87 degrees west,\
      \ so Madison being west of Chicago (since Chicago is in Illinois, which is south\
      \ of Wisconsin but Madison is a bit north and west), so maybe Madison is around\
      \ 89\xB0W. \n\nLos Angeles, CA is approximately 118 degrees west longitude.\
      \ Wait, no, that's too far. Wait, San Francisco is around 122\xB0W, so Los Angeles\
      \ is a bit south but similar longitude. Maybe around 118\xB0W. So, if Madison\
      \ is around 89\xB0W and Los Angeles is 118\xB0W, then Madison is east of Los\
      \ Angeles because 89\xB0W is less than 118\xB0W (since both are west, but 89\
      \ is closer to the prime meridian). Therefore, Madison is east of LA. \n\nBut\
      \ wait, maybe I got the longitudes wrong. Let me think again. For example, New\
      \ York is about 74\xB0W, Chicago is 87\xB0W, Denver is 105\xB0W, Los Angeles\
      \ is 118\xB0W. So, Madison being in Wisconsin, which is just west of Lake Michigan,\
      \ would be around 89\xB0W. So, yes, 89 is east of 118. Therefore, the University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013Madison is indeed east of UCLA. \n\nSo the answer should\
      \ be YES. But wait, let me make sure. Let me visualize a map of the US. The\
      \ West Coast is California, Oregon, Washington. The Midwest includes states\
      \ like Wisconsin, Illinois, etc. So Wisconsin is to the east of California.\
      \ So any location in Wisconsin would be east of any location in California,\
      \ right? Because California is on the west coast, and Wisconsin is in the Midwest,\
      \ which is much further east. Even though Wisconsin is in the northern part\
      \ of the Midwest, it's still way east compared to California. \n\nSo yes, the\
      \ University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison is located east of UCLA. Therefore, the\
      \ answer is YES.\n</think>YES. The University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison is located\
      \ in Wisconsin, which is in the Midwest, while UCLA is in Los Angeles on the\
      \ West Coast. Since Wisconsin is significantly further east than California\
      \ (with Madison at approximately 89\xB0W longitude and Los Angeles at 118\xB0\
      W longitude), the answer is YES. \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    294bc0b2-a818-48af-ad22-600a4dc3a589: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ asking if the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison College of Engineering,\
      \ located in Wisconsin, is east of the University of California, Los Angeles\
      \ (UCLA) in California. I need to figure out their geographical positions relative\
      \ to each other. \n\nFirst, I should recall where these two universities are\
      \ located. The University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison is in Madison, Wisconsin.\
      \ UCLA is in Los Angeles, California. Now, I need to determine the relative\
      \ east-west positions of these two cities.\n\nI know that the United States\
      \ is broadly divided into regions. Wisconsin is in the Midwest, specifically\
      \ in the northern part, while California is on the West Coast. Los Angeles is\
      \ in Southern California, right along the Pacific Ocean. Madison, WI, being\
      \ in the Midwest, is much more inland compared to LA. \n\nTo determine east\
      \ or west, I need to consider the longitudinal coordinates. The further east\
      \ a location is, the higher its longitude value (or lower if considering east\
      \ as negative, depending on the system). Wait, no, longitude runs from 0\xB0\
      \ at the Prime Meridian (Greenwich, UK) going east to 180\xB0 and west to -180\xB0\
      . For the US, all locations are west of the Prime Meridian, so their longitudes\
      \ are negative values. For example, Los Angeles is around 118\xB0 West, which\
      \ would be -118 degrees. Madison, WI, I think is around 89\xB0 West (-89 degrees).\
      \ \n\nWait, longitude: the more west a place is, the higher the numerical value\
      \ in the west (since west longitudes are negative, but if we ignore the sign,\
      \ a higher number west means further west). So, comparing -118 (LA) and -89\
      \ (Madison). Since -118 is further west (lower in value when considering negative\
      \ numbers), that would mean Madison, WI is east of Los Angeles, CA. Because\
      \ -89 is a larger number than -118 (since -89 is to the right of -118 on the\
      \ number line). So yes, Madison is east of LA. Therefore, the answer would be\
      \ YES.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If a city is further to the east, its longitude\
      \ is closer to the Prime Meridian (closer to 0). For example, New York is around\
      \ -74\xB0, which is east of Chicago at -87.5\xB0, which is east of Denver at\
      \ -105\xB0, which is east of LA at -118\xB0. So Madison, at -89.4\xB0 (approx),\
      \ is west of New York and Chicago (since -89.4 is west of -87.5?), wait no:\
      \ wait, longitude for Madison, WI is approximately 89.4\xB0 West, which is 89.4\
      \ W. Chicago is about 87.6 W. So Madison is actually west of Chicago. But how\
      \ does that compare to LA? LA is 118.25 W. So 89.4 W is east of 118.25 W. Because\
      \ the lower the longitude (when measured in west degrees), the further east.\
      \ So 89.4 W is east of 118.25 W. So Madison is east of LA. Therefore, YES.\n\
      \nWait, but I should confirm the exact coordinates. Let me quickly check approximate\
      \ longitudes. \n\nMadison, WI: According to a quick mental note, Madison is\
      \ located in southern Wisconsin. Its longitude is approximately 89.4\xB0 West.\
      \ \n\nLos Angeles, CA: The longitude is approximately 118.25\xB0 West. \n\n\
      Since 89.4\xB0 W is a smaller number than 118.25\xB0 W when considering west\
      \ longitude (since west longitude increases as you go west), Madison is east\
      \ of Los Angeles. Because 89.4\xB0 W is closer to the Prime Meridian (0\xB0\
      ) than 118.25\xB0 W. So, moving east from Los Angeles (118 W) you would reach\
      \ Madison (89 W) before getting to the Prime Meridian. Therefore, the University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013Madison is indeed east of UCLA. \n\nSo the answer is YES.\n\
      </think>YES  \nThe University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison (longitude ~89.4\xB0\
      \ W) is east of UCLA (longitude ~118.25\xB0 W), as lower numerical longitude\
      \ values (west) indicate positions further east."
    5f8483f9-b3d5-4208-9010-692a334a5baf: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison College of Engineering in\

      \ universities and determine their relative positions, specifically which one\
      \ is further east.\n\nFirst, I know that Wisconsin is a state in the Midwest,\
      \ while California is on the West Coast. So, generally, the Midwest is east\
      \ of the West Coast. But I should check the exact longitudes to be sure because\
      \ sometimes states can have parts that are more east or west than others.\n\n\
      The University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison is in Madison, Wisconsin. Let me recall\
      \ that Madison is the capital of Wisconsin. I think Wisconsin is north of Illinois\
      \ and to the west of Lake Michigan. California is on the Pacific coast, so cities\
      \ there like Los Angeles are pretty far west. \n\nLongitude is the key here.\
      \ Places with a higher east longitude (more positive in the western hemisphere)\
      \ are further east. Wait, no, longitude is measured from the prime meridian.\
      \ For the United States, which is in the western hemisphere, the longitude is\
      \ west, so it's measured in degrees west, which are negative numbers. So, a\
      \ location with a smaller longitude (less negative) is further east. For example,\
      \ New York City is around -74 degrees, and Los Angeles is around -118 degrees.\
      \ So New York is east of LA because -74 is greater (less negative) than -118.\n\
      \nSo, I need to find the longitude of Madison, WI and UCLA in LA. Let me try\
      \ to remember or estimate. Madison, Wisconsin: I think it's somewhere around\
      \ 89 degrees west longitude. Let me confirm. Yes, Madison's coordinates are\
      \ approximately 43.0731\xB0 N, 89.4012\xB0 W. So that's longitude -89.4012.\n\
      \nUCLA is in Los Angeles, California. The coordinates for UCLA are approximately\
      \ 34.0689\xB0 N, 118.4457\xB0 W. So that's longitude -118.4457.\n\nComparing\
      \ the two longitudes: Madison is at -89.4, UCLA at -118.45. Since -89.4 is more\
      \ east than -118.45 (because -89.4 is less negative), that means Madison, WI\
      \ is east of Los Angeles, CA. Therefore, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison\
      \ College of Engineering is indeed east of UCLA.\n\nWait, but let me make sure\
      \ I didn't mix up the directions. The further west a place is in the US, the\

    72dd2618-546c-4e9d-843c-5fcd474761ad: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison College of Engineering, WI is located\
      \ east of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), CA. Let's start\
      \ by breaking this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that both universities\
      \ are in different states: Wisconsin (WI) and California (CA). The question\
      \ is about their relative east-west positions. East and west in the US are generally\
      \ determined by longitude; places with a higher longitude (more to the east)\
      \ are further east. Wait, no, actually, longitude increases as you go west in\
      \ the Western Hemisphere. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. The prime\
      \ meridian is 0 degrees, and as you go west, the longitude becomes negative\
      \ in the Americas. So for the US, the eastern states like New York have a more\
      \ positive longitude (around -73 for NYC), while California is further west\
      \ with a more negative longitude, like around -118 for LA. So, the more west\
      \ you go, the more negative the longitude becomes. Therefore, if a location\
      \ has a less negative (or more positive) longitude, it's further east. \n\n\
      So now I need to find the longitudes of both universities. Let's start with\
      \ the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. Madison is the capital of Wisconsin.\
      \ I remember that Wisconsin is in the Midwest, north of Illinois, which is where\
      \ Chicago is. So Madison, WI, is somewhere in the northern part of the state.\
      \ Let me check approximate coordinates. From memory, Madison's coordinates are\
      \ approximately 43.0748\xB0 N, 89.4039\xB0 W. So the longitude is -89.4039.\
      \ \n\nNow, UCLA is in Los Angeles, California. The coordinates for UCLA are\
      \ approximately 34.0689\xB0 N, 118.4453\xB0 W. So the longitude here is -118.4453.\
      \ \n\nComparing the two longitudes: Wisconsin-Madison is at around -89.4, and\
      \ UCLA is at -118.45. Since longitude becomes more negative as you go west,\
      \ a less negative value means further east. So -89.4 is more east than -118.45.\
      \ Therefore, Madison, WI, is east of Los Angeles, CA. Hence, the University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013Madison College of Engineering would be east of UCLA. \n\
      \nWait, but let me double-check in case I mixed up the longitude. If I have\
      \ two points, one at -89 and another at -118, the one at -89 is actually east\
      \ of the other. For example, the prime meridian is 0. Going west from there,\
      \ you get to -1, -2, etc. So -89 is east of -118 because it's closer to 0. So\
      \ yes, Madison is east of Los Angeles. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be YES.\n\
      </think>The University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison (longitude \u2248 -89.4\xB0\
      \ W) is east of UCLA (longitude \u2248 -118.45\xB0 W) because -89.4\xB0 is less\

    b12b331c-d964-4fc3-8f4a-07487941cf06: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison College of Engineering in Wisconsin\
      \ is located east of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in California.\
      \ Let's start by breaking this down. \n\nFirst, I should recall the general\
      \ geographic locations of these two states. Wisconsin is in the Midwest, right?\
      \ It's one of the states near the Great Lakes. California is on the West Coast,\
      \ obviously. So, UCLA is in Southern California, near the Pacific Ocean. Now,\
      \ comparing east and west positions, generally, the Midwest is east of the West\
      \ Coast. But wait, maybe I should get more specific.\n\nLet me think about the\
      \ actual longitude coordinates of each university. Longitude measures how far\
      \ east or west a place is. If a location has a higher longitude (more east)\
      \ than another, it's further east. Wait, no. Longitude lines run from the North\
      \ Pole to the South Pole. The prime meridian is 0\xB0, which goes through Greenwich,\
      \ England. West longitudes are west of that, and east longitudes are east. So\
      \ in the US, all locations are west of the prime meridian, meaning their longitude\
      \ is measured in degrees west (or negative if using the -180 to +180 system).\
      \ So UCLA is in Los Angeles, which is on the West Coast. Let me check approximate\
      \ longitudes.\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin\u2013Madison: Madison, WI. Looking\
      \ up, I think Madison's longitude is around 89.4\xB0 West. Let me confirm. Yes,\
      \ Madison, WI is approximately 43.07\xB0 N latitude, -89.40\xB0 W longitude.\
      \ \n\nUCLA is in Los Angeles, CA. Los Angeles is around 34.05\xB0 N, -118.25\xB0\
      \ W. So comparing the longitudes: Madison is at -89.40\xB0 W, and LA is at -118.25\xB0\
      \ W. Wait, but in terms of east-west, the more westward a place is, the higher\
      \ the negative number (or the lower the actual longitude value if we consider\
      \ west as positive). For example, 0\xB0 is in Greenwich. Moving west from there,\
      \ you go to -1\xB0, -2\xB0, etc. So a longitude of -89.4 is actually east of\
      \ -118.25 because -89.4 is closer to 0 (i.e., less west) than -118.25. So Madison,\
      \ WI is east of Los Angeles, CA. Therefore, the University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Madison's College of Engineering would be east of UCLA. \n\nWait, but maybe\
      \ I should double-check. Let's think in terms of actual directions. If I'm in\

      \ is closer to the prime meridian (0\xB0) than -118.25\xB0 W, Madison is east\
      \ of Los Angeles. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    b2c776fb-523a-409c-bfb0-09a3d740a69b: "<think>Okay, let's figure out if the University\

      Madison is in Madison, Wisconsin. UCLA is in Los Angeles, California. I should\
      \ check the geographical positions. \n\nI know that the United States is laid\
      \ out with California on the west coast and Wisconsin in the Midwest. Los Angeles\
      \ is on the west coast, so UCLA is definitely in the western part of the US.\
      \ Madison, WI is further inland. But east vs west is relative. \n\nTo compare\
      \ their longitudes. Places east have higher longitude if we're using the western\
      \ hemisphere (since longitude increases going east, but actually west longitudes\
      \ are negative). Wait, no, in the US, all longitudes are west of the prime meridian,\
      \ so they're negative numbers. So a more eastern location would have a less\
      \ negative (higher) longitude. For example, New York is around -74, while LA\
      \ is around -118. So the more east you go, the closer the longitude is to zero.\n\
      \nSo Madison, WI's longitude. Let me think. Madison is in southern Wisconsin.\
      \ Maybe around 43\xB0N latitude, and longitude about -89\xB0W. UCLA is in Los\
      \ Angeles, which is around 34\xB0N, -118\xB0W. \n\nComparing the longitudes:\
      \ Madison is at approximately -89\xB0, UCLA at -118\xB0. Since -89 is greater\
      \ (less negative) than -118, Madison is east of Los Angeles. Therefore, University\

    d7ddc7e1-8b3a-4210-83b3-d11524a2189c: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ asking if the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison College of Engineering\
      \ in Wisconsin is located east of the University of California, Los Angeles\
      \ (UCLA) in California. I need to figure out the answer step by step.\n\nFirst,\
      \ I should recall where each of these universities is located. The University\
      \ of Wisconsin\u2013Madison is in Madison, Wisconsin. UCLA is in Los Angeles,\
      \ California. So the main thing here is comparing the geographical positions\
      \ of these two cities to determine if Madison is east of Los Angeles.\n\nI know\
      \ that the United States is divided into different time zones. The east coast\
      \ is in the Eastern Time Zone, and moving west, there's Central, Mountain, and\
      \ Pacific Time Zones. Wisconsin is in the Central Time Zone, right? Because\
      \ states like Illinois (Chicago) are Central, and Wisconsin is just north of\
      \ Illinois. California is in the Pacific Time Zone, which is three hours behind\
      \ the Eastern Time Zone. So Los Angeles is in Pacific Time, which is two hours\
      \ behind Central Time (since Central is UTC-6 and Pacific is UTC-8 during standard\
      \ time). Wait, no, actually, Central is UTC-6, Mountain UTC-7, Pacific UTC-8.\
      \ So from Central to Pacific is two hours difference. So Wisconsin is two hours\
      \ ahead of California.\n\nBut time zones might not directly answer the east-west\
      \ question, but they can give a rough idea. Generally, moving from east to west\
      \ across the US, you go from Eastern, Central, Mountain, to Pacific. So states\
      \ in the Central Time Zone are east of those in the Pacific. So Wisconsin (Central)\
      \ is east of California (Pacific). Therefore, Madison, WI would be east of Los\
      \ Angeles, CA.\n\nBut maybe I should check the actual longitudes. Longitude\
      \ measures east-west position. The higher the longitude (more west), the further\
      \ west a location is. Wait, no, longitude is measured from the prime meridian\
      \ (0\xB0), with values increasing going east (up to 180\xB0) and west (down\
      \ to -180\xB0). In the US, all longitudes are west of the prime meridian, so\
      \ they would be expressed as negative numbers when using decimal degrees. For\
      \ example, Los Angeles is around 118\xB0W, and Madison, WI is around 89\xB0\
      W. Wait, that's not right. Let me think. The prime meridian is 0\xB0, so moving\
      \ west from there, the longitude becomes negative in the western hemisphere.\
      \ So Los Angeles is approximately 118 degrees west longitude, which is written\
      \ as -118. Madison, Wisconsin is around 89 degrees west longitude, so -89. \n\
      \nSince longitude is measured from 0\xB0 at Greenwich, going west to 180\xB0\
      , a lower numerical value (closer to 0) in the west means a location is more\
      \ east. So Madison's longitude is -89.4 (approx), and Los Angeles is around\
      \ -118.25. So comparing these two, -89.4 is east of -118.25 because -89.4 is\
      \ closer to 0. Therefore, Madison is indeed east of Los Angeles.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \nThe University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Madison (longitude ~-89.4\xB0) is located east of UCLA (longitude ~-118.3\xB0\
      ) because its longitude is closer to the prime meridian (0\xB0), indicating\
      \ a more easterly position in the U.S."

      \nFirst, I know that Wisconsin is in the Midwest, while California is on the\

      \ have a higher longitude value (more west) compared to Madison, which is further\
      \ east.\n\nLet me confirm the approximate longitudes. Madison, WI: I think it's\
      \ around 89 degrees West longitude. Los Angeles, CA is around 118 degrees West.\
      \ Wait, but wait, if Los Angeles has a longitude of 118\xB0W and Madison is\
      \ 89\xB0W, that means Madison is actually east of Los Angeles because 89\xB0\
      W is less than 118\xB0W. Since lower longitude numbers (closer to 0) are more\
      \ east. \n\nSo, for example, New York City is around 74\xB0W, which is east\
      \ of Chicago at 87\xB0W. So applying the same logic, Madison at 89\xB0W is east\
      \ of Los Angeles at 118\xB0W. Therefore, yes, the University of Wisconsin\u2013\
      Madison is east of UCLA.\n</think>YES  \nThe University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison\

      \ Virginia. Right? Yeah, I remember that. And Vanderbilt University is in Nashville,\
      \ Tennessee. So now I need to compare their geographical positions. \n\nSo both\
      \ states are in the southeastern part of the US. Virginia is to the east of\
      \ Tennessee, I believe. Wait, no, actually, let me think. The states are arranged\
      \ from the east coast moving west. So on the East Coast, you have states like\
      \ Virginia, then moving west, you hit Tennessee. So Virginia is east of Tennessee?\
      \ Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me visualize the map. \n\nVirginia is on\
      \ the east coast, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean. Tennessee is a landlocked\
      \ state, located west of Virginia's western border. So, for example, if you\
      \ look at the map, Virginia is to the east of Tennessee. Therefore, any point\
      \ in Virginia would be east of any point in Tennessee. But wait, that can't\
      \ be entirely correct because states aren't perfectly aligned. For example,\
      \ parts of Virginia might extend further west than parts of Tennessee. But generally,\
      \ Tennessee is west of Virginia. \n\nWait, Virginia's western border is with\
      \ Kentucky, right? And Kentucky is north of Tennessee. So actually, Tennessee\
      \ is south of Kentucky and west of North Carolina. Let me get this straight.\
      \ The states from east to west along that latitude might be: Virginia, then\
      \ maybe North Carolina, then Tennessee? Wait no. Let me recall. Virginia is\
      \ to the north of North Carolina. So Virginia's southern border is with North\
      \ Carolina. Then to the west of Virginia is West Virginia (which is actually\
      \ a separate state), and then Kentucky. Tennessee is south of Kentucky. So,\
      \ Nashville, TN would be southwest of Virginia. \n\nSo Blacksburg, VA is in\
      \ western Virginia, near the border with West Virginia. Nashville is in central\
      \ Tennessee. So if Virginia Tech is in western Virginia, and Vanderbilt is in\
      \ central Tennessee, is western Virginia east of central Tennessee? To determine\
      \ that, maybe I should look at their longitudes. \n\nLongitude is the key here.\
      \ Places with higher (more east) longitude are further east. Wait, no, in the\
      \ US, longitude is measured west from the prime meridian. So a higher longitude\
      \ value (in negative degrees because it's west) means further west. Wait, no,\
      \ longitude in the US is west longitude, so numbers are negative. For example,\
      \ New York City is around -74 degrees, Los Angeles around -118. So the more\
      \ negative the longitude, the further west it is. \n\nSo if I can find the longitude\

      \ -80 degrees longitude? Nashville is in Tennessee, which is further west. Maybe\
      \ around -86 degrees? So if Blacksburg is -80 and Nashville is -86, then Blacksburg's\
      \ longitude is less negative, meaning it's further east. Therefore, Virginia\
      \ Tech would be east of Vanderbilt. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify the\
      \ actual longitudes. I'm not 100% sure. Let me try to recall. Virginia's western\
      \ border is around 83 degrees west longitude? Wait, no. For example, Roanoke,\
      \ VA is around -79.9, so approximately -80. Nashville, TN is around -86.8. So\
      \ yes, Blacksburg, being in western Virginia, is around -80.7 (just looked up,\

      \ positions. \n\nLooking at a map of the United States, Virginia is to the east\
      \ of Tennessee. But wait, Virginia Tech is in the western part of Virginia,\
      \ while Vanderbilt is in the middle of Tennessee. So even though Virginia as\
      \ a state is east of Tennessee, the specific location of Virginia Tech might\
      \ be further west compared to Vanderbilt. \n\nLet me think about the longitude\
      \ coordinates. Longitude determines east-west positioning. The more eastward\
      \ a location is, the higher its longitude value (in the western hemisphere,\
      \ longitude is negative, so a smaller negative number is more east). So, if\
      \ Blacksburg, VA has a more western longitude (more negative) than Nashville,\
      \ TN, then Virginia Tech would be west of Vanderbilt. \n\nChecking the approximate\
      \ longitudes: Nashville, TN is around -86.78 degrees. Blacksburg, VA is approximately\
      \ -80.41 degrees. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I mixed up the\
      \ numbers. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, actually, Nashville's longitude is\
      \ about -86.78, and Blacksburg's is around -80.41. Wait, but longitude decreases\
      \ as you go west. So, -80 is more east than -86. So, Blacksburg is at -80.41,\
      \ which is east of Nashville's -86.78. Therefore, Virginia Tech (Blacksburg)\
      \ is east of Vanderbilt (Nashville). \n\nWait, but I thought Virginia Tech was\
      \ in southwestern Virginia. How does that compare to Nashville's position? Let\
      \ me visualize the map. Tennessee is to the west of Virginia. So the western\
      \ border of Virginia is adjacent to the eastern border of Tennessee. But Nashville\
      \ is in the middle of Tennessee, so it's further west than the eastern part\
      \ of Tennessee. However, Blacksburg is in southwestern Virginia, which is near\
      \ the border with Tennessee. So, if you look at the map, the westernmost part\
      \ of Virginia is actually further west than the eastern part of Tennessee. Wait,\
      \ no. Let me think again. \n\nVirginia is to the east of Tennessee. So the entire\
      \ state of Virginia is east of Tennessee. But within Virginia, Blacksburg is\
      \ in the southwest, so it's as far west as Virginia goes. But since Tennessee\
      \ is west of Virginia, even the westernmost part of Virginia is still east of\
      \ the entire state of Tennessee. Wait, that can't be right. Because states are\
      \ adjacent. For example, Bristol is a city that's split between Virginia and\
      \ Tennessee. So the state line runs through it. So, the western border of Virginia\
      \ is the eastern border of Tennessee. Therefore, any point in Virginia is east\
      \ of any point in Tennessee. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if you have\
      \ a city in eastern Tennessee, like Knoxville, it's east within Tennessee, but\
      \ compared to Virginia, which is to the east, but the western part of Virginia\
      \ is adjacent to eastern Tennessee. So, for example, Bristol, VA is directly\
      \ adjacent to Bristol, TN. So, the western edge of Virginia is the same longitude\
      \ as the eastern edge of Tennessee. Therefore, a university in southwestern\
      \ Virginia (like Virginia Tech) would be at the same longitude as the eastern\
      \ part of Tennessee. But Vanderbilt is in Nashville, which is in central Tennessee,\
      \ further west than the eastern border. Therefore, Virginia Tech, being in southwestern\
      \ VA, would be east of Nashville, TN. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check\
      \ the exact longitudes. Let me look up the coordinates. \n\nVirginia Tech's\
      \ coordinates: approximately 37.2284\xB0 N, 80.4234\xB0 W. \n\nVanderbilt University's\
      \ coordinates: 36.1447\xB0 N, 86.8027\xB0 W. \n\nComparing the longitudes: Virginia\
      \ Tech is at 80.42\xB0W, Vanderbilt at 86.80\xB0W. Since 80.42 is less than\
      \ 86.80 (because in negative terms, -80.42 is more east than -86.80), Virginia\
      \ Tech is indeed east of Vanderbilt. \n\nSo even though Virginia Tech is in\
      \ the western part of Virginia, it's still east of Vanderbilt in central Tennessee\
      \ because the entire state of Virginia is east of Tennessee. The longitude difference\
      \ confirms that. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \nVirginia Tech\
      \ in Blacksburg, VA (longitude \u2248 -80.42\xB0) is east of Vanderbilt University\
      \ in Nashville, TN (longitude \u2248 -86.80\xB0), as a smaller numerical longitude\
      \ (less negative) indicates a more easterly position."

      \ if Virginia Tech in Virginia is located east of Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.\
      \ Hmm, okay, first, I need to know where both universities are located. \n\n\
      So Virginia Tech, right? I think that's Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State\

      \ Nashville, Tennessee. Now, I need to figure out the geographical positions\
      \ of these two cities to see which is further east.\n\nLet me recall the general\
      \ locations of the states. Virginia is on the east coast, but Tennessee is more\
      \ inland, west of Virginia. Wait, no, actually, looking at the map, Tennessee\
      \ is south of Kentucky and north of Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. Virginia\
      \ is to the northeast of Tennessee. So maybe Blacksburg, VA, is on the western\
      \ side of Virginia, closer to the border with Tennessee. While Nashville is\
      \ in central Tennessee. \n\nWait, but directionally, is Blacksburg east of Nashville?\
      \ Let's think about their longitudes. The longitude determines east-west position.\
      \ The further east a place is (higher longitude in the western hemisphere?),\
      \ no, actually, longitude lines run from the Prime Meridian. In the US, all\
      \ longitudes are west, so they have negative values. So a lower longitude (more\
      \ negative) would be further west, and a higher longitude (closer to zero) is\
      \ further east. \n\nSo, if I can find the longitude of Blacksburg, VA, and Nashville,\
      \ TN, compare them. The city with the higher longitude (less negative) would\
      \ be further east. Let me try to recall or estimate their coordinates. \n\n\
      Blacksburg, VA: I think it's in southwestern Virginia. Coordinates might be\
      \ around 37.23\xB0 N, 80.42\xB0 W. \n\nNashville, TN: It's in central Tennessee.\
      \ Let's say approximately 36.16\xB0 N, 86.78\xB0 W. \n\nWait, so Blacksburg's\
      \ longitude is -80.42, and Nashville's is -86.78. Comparing the two, -80.42\
      \ is higher (less negative) than -86.78. That means Blacksburg is east of Nashville.\
      \ Therefore, Virginia Tech (Blacksburg, VA) is east of Vanderbilt University\
      \ (Nashville, TN). \n\nWait, but let me confirm. If a place has a longitude\
      \ of 80\xB0W, that's further east than 86\xB0W, because each degree west is\
      \ further west. So yes, 80\xB0W is east of 86\xB0W. So their conclusions hold.\
      \ \n\nTherefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>To determine if Virginia\

      \ positions. Eastern locations have lower west longitude numbers (since longitude\
      \ decreases as you go east). So if Northwestern is at around 87.67\xB0W and\

      \ longitude (in the western hemisphere, it's west longitude, but the US is in\
      \ the western hemisphere, so longitude is measured west from the prime meridian).\
      \ Wait, maybe I should check the actual coordinates.\n\nLet me think. The prime\
      \ meridian is 0\xB0, and as you go west, the longitude increases in the west\
      \ direction. So, for the US, all longitudes are west, so they are measured as\
      \ degrees west (W). So, a location with a smaller numerical value (less west)\
      \ would be further east. For example, if one place is at 80\xB0W and another\
      \ at 90\xB0W, the 80\xB0W is further east because it's closer to the prime meridian.\n\
      \nSo, I need to find the longitudes of both universities. Let's start with Northwestern\
      \ University in Evanston, IL. Evanston is near Chicago. Chicago's coordinates\
      \ are approximately 41.8781\xB0 N, 87.6298\xB0 W. So, Northwestern's longitude\
      \ is around 87.6\xB0 W.\n\nNow, the University of Georgia in Athens, GA. Athens,\
      \ GA's coordinates are approximately 33.9519\xB0 N, 83.3761\xB0 W. So, its longitude\
      \ is about 83.38\xB0 W.\n\nComparing the two: Northwestern is at ~87.63\xB0\
      \ W, UGA at ~83.38\xB0 W. Since 83.38\xB0 W is a smaller number than 87.63\xB0\
      \ W, that means UGA is further east. Because being less west (closer to the\
      \ prime meridian) means more east. So, yes, University of Georgia is east of\
      \ Northwestern University.\n</think>YES  \nThe University of Georgia (Athens,\
      \ GA) is located at approximately 83.38\xB0 W longitude, while Northwestern\
      \ University (Evanston, IL) is at approximately 87.63\xB0 W. Since lower western\
      \ longitude values are farther east, UGA is east of Northwestern.  \n\n**Answer:**\
      \ YES"
    5e16407d-17da-4b46-8434-4b6ec941f60f: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the University of Georgia (GA) is located east of Northwestern University\
      \ in Illinois (IL). Hmm, I need to figure out the locations of both universities\

      \ is. The University of Georgia is in Georgia, which is a state in the southeastern\
      \ United States. The main campus is in Athens, GA. Northwestern University is\
      \ in Illinois, specifically in Evanston, which is a suburb just north of Chicago.\
      \ So Chicago is in the northern part of Illinois, near Lake Michigan.\n\nNow,\
      \ to determine east or west, longitude is the key. Places with a higher longitude\
      \ (more east) are further east. Wait, no, longitude is measured from the prime\
      \ meridian. In the US, which is west of the prime meridian, so all longitudes\
      \ are negative when expressed in decimal degrees (like -80 degrees). But when\
      \ comparing two places in the US, the one with the less negative (closer to\
      \ zero) longitude is more east. For example, if one is -80 and another is -87,\
      \ the -80 is further east because it's closer to the prime meridian.\n\nSo I\
      \ need the specific longitudes. Let me think. Chicago, IL is around 87.6\xB0\
      \ West longitude, which would be approximately -87.6. Athens, GA is in northeastern\
      \ Georgia. I think Atlanta is around -84.4, but Athens is a bit east of Atlanta.\
      \ Maybe Athens is around -83.4 or so? Let me check that. Wait, if Atlanta is\
      \ at approximately 84.4\xB0W, then Athens, being east of Atlanta, would be a\
      \ bit more east, so maybe 83.3\xB0W? So converting to decimal degrees, that\
      \ would be -83.3 for Athens, GA, and -87.6 for Evanston, IL (Northwestern).\
      \ \n\nComparing those, -83.3 is more east than -87.6 because -83.3 is a larger\

      \ IL. Therefore, the University of Georgia is located east of Northwestern University.\
      \ \n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check the exact coordinates. Let me recall.\
      \ The University of Georgia's coordinates are approximately 33.95\xB0 N latitude,\
      \ -83.37\xB0 W longitude. Northwestern University in Evanston is around 42.05\xB0\
      \ N, -87.67\xB0 W. So comparing the longitudes: -83.37 vs. -87.67. Since -83.37\

      \ the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \nThe University of Georgia (Athens,\

      \ of -87.67\xB0, the University of Georgia is east of Northwestern University.\
      \  \n\n**Answer: YES**"
    753b34a5-fd6a-4dd1-ba8c-2389fc990548: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question.\
      \ So, the question is whether the University of Georgia (UGA) in Georgia is\
      \ located east of Northwestern University in Illinois. Hmm, okay, I need to\
      \ figure out the geographic locations of both universities and then determine\
      \ their relative positions from east to west.\n\nFirst, I should recall where\
      \ each university is. UGA is in Georgia. I know that Georgia is a state in the\
      \ southeastern United States. The main campus of the University of Georgia is\
      \ in Athens, GA. Northwestern University, on the other hand, is in Illinois.\
      \ Specifically, Northwestern's main campus is in Evanston, Illinois, which is\
      \ a suburb just north of Chicago. So, I need to compare the longitudes of these\
      \ two cities because longitude determines east-west positioning.\n\nI think\
      \ the next step is to find the approximate longitude coordinates for Athens,\
      \ GA, and Evanston, IL. Places further east have higher longitude values if\
      \ we're talking about the eastern hemisphere, but in the western hemisphere\
      \ (which includes the US), longitude is measured in degrees west, so actually,\
      \ a more easterly location would have a lower longitude value (since it's closer\
      \ to the prime meridian). Wait, no, longitude in the US is west longitude, so\
      \ numbers are negative when expressed in decimal degrees. For example, New York\
      \ might be around -74 degrees, and Los Angeles around -118 degrees. So, the\
      \ more east a location is, the closer its longitude is to 0 (i.e., less negative).\
      \ So, if Evanston, IL, has a longitude that's more west (more negative) than\
      \ Athens, GA, then Athens would be east of Evanston.\n\nLet me confirm that.\
      \ Let me think: The U.S. is in the western hemisphere, so all longitudes are\
      \ west of the prime meridian, hence negative when using the standard coordinate\
      \ system where east longitudes are positive and west are negative. So, if a\
      \ place is further east in the US, its longitude is a smaller negative number.\
      \ For example, New York City is around -74 degrees, while Chicago is around\
      \ -87.6 degrees. So NYC is east of Chicago because -74 is greater (less negative)\
      \ than -87.6. Therefore, the city with the higher (less negative) longitude\
      \ is farther east.\n\nSo, to answer the question, I need to find the longitudes\
      \ of Athens, GA, and Evanston, IL. Let me try to recall or estimate. Athens,\
      \ GA, is in the northern part of Georgia. Atlanta is around -84.38 degrees longitude.\
      \ Athens is a bit northeast of Atlanta, so maybe its longitude is a bit higher\
      \ (less negative). Let me check that. Wait, moving northeast from Atlanta, would\
      \ the longitude increase? Well, longitude lines run north-south, so moving east\
      \ would increase longitude (make it less negative), while moving west would\
      \ decrease it (more negative). So, if Athens is east of Atlanta, its longitude\
      \ would be higher (less negative). Let's see, Atlanta is around 33.7490\xB0\
      \ N, 84.3880\xB0 W. So longitude is -84.3880. Athens, GA, is about 33.9556\xB0\
      \ N, 83.3833\xB0 W. Wait, that's latitude 33.95, longitude -83.38. So longitude\
      \ is approximately -83.38. So that's higher (less negative) than Atlanta's -84.38.\
      \ So Athens is east of Atlanta.\n\nNow Evanston, IL: Evanston is near Chicago.\
      \ Chicago's coordinates are approximately 41.8781\xB0 N, 87.6298\xB0 W. So Evanston,\
      \ being just north of Chicago, would be similar. Let me check Evanston's coordinates.\
      \ Evanston, IL, is around 42.0451\xB0 N, 87.6877\xB0 W. So the longitude is\
      \ approximately -87.69. \n\nComparing the two longitudes: Athens, GA, is at\
      \ -83.38, and Evanston, IL, is at -87.69. Since -83.38 is higher (less negative)\
      \ than -87.69, that means Athens is east of Evanston. Therefore, the University\
      \ of Georgia in GA is indeed located east of Northwestern University in IL.\

    ae6e44ac-2833-47d8-a62d-fb8f7773d2aa: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether the University of Georgia in Georgia is located east of Northwestern\

      \ Georgia. I think the main campus is in Athens, Georgia. And Northwestern University\
      \ is in Illinois, specifically in Evanston, which is a suburb just north of\
      \ Chicago. So right off the bat, I need to get the approximate longitudes of\

      \ east a location is (higher longitude in the western hemisphere?), wait, no\u2014\
      longitude increases as you go east from the prime meridian. But since both are\
      \ in the US, which is west of the prime meridian, their longitudes are negative.\
      \ So more eastward locations would have less negative (higher) longitude values.\n\
      \nWait, let me make sure. For example, New York is around -74 longitude, and\
      \ Los Angeles is around -118. So New York is east, has a higher (less negative)\

      \ longitude is higher (less negative) than Northwestern's, then yes, it's east.\n\
      \nSo I need to find the coordinates for both universities. Let's start with\
      \ Northwestern University. Evanston, IL. Let me recall: Chicago is approximately\
      \ 41.88\xB0 N, -87.63\xB0 W. Evanston is a bit north of Chicago, so probably\
      \ similar longitude. Maybe around -87.7\xB0 or so. Let me check in my mind...\
      \ Wait, Chicago's downtown is around -87.62, and Evanston is a bit north, but\
      \ the longitude shouldn't differ much. Let's approximate Northwestern as -87.7\xB0\
      \ W longitude.\n\nNow, University of Georgia in Athens, GA. Athens is northeast\
      \ of Atlanta. Atlanta is around 33.75\xB0 N, -84.39\xB0 W. Athens is a bit to\
      \ the east of Atlanta. So maybe Athens has a slightly more east longitude. Let's\
      \ say around -83.3\xB0 W? Wait, Atlanta is at -84.39, so moving east would decrease\
      \ the longitude's absolute value. If Atlanta is -84.39, moving east to Athens\
      \ would make it, say, -83.4 or so. But I need to be precise here. Perhaps I\
      \ should remember that Athens, GA's coordinates are approximately 33.95\xB0\
      \ N, -83.37\xB0 W. So longitude of -83.37.\n\nComparing the two: Northwestern\
      \ is around -87.7\xB0, UGA is around -83.37\xB0. Since -83.37 is greater (less\

      \ University of Georgia in GA is located east of Northwestern University in\
      \ IL.\n\nWait, let me verify the exact coordinates to be sure. Northwestern\
      \ University's campus in Evanston, IL: According to my knowledge, the coordinates\

      W. So if a place has a smaller (less west) longitude, it's further east.\n\n\
      So I need to find the approximate longitudes of Athens, GA and Evanston, IL.\
      \ Let me recall or estimate. Let's see. Chicago is around 87\xB0W longitude.\
      \ Evanston is just north of Chicago, so maybe around 87.7\xB0W or something\
      \ close. For Athens, GA, I think Atlanta is about 84.3\xB0W. Athens is northeast\
      \ of Atlanta, so probably a bit further east, maybe around 83.3\xB0W? Or perhaps\
      \ similar. Wait, actually, Atlanta's longitude is approximately 84.388\xB0W.\
      \ Athens, GA is east of Atlanta, so it would have a lower longitude (less west),\
      \ meaning further east. Let me confirm that. If Atlanta is 84.388\xB0W, moving\
      \ east in Georgia would mean approaching South Carolina, which is further east.\
      \ So Athens, GA's longitude might be around 83.3\xB0W or 83.5\xB0W? \n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe I can think of their approximate positions. The University of Georgia\
      \ (Athens) is in the northeast part of Georgia. Georgia's eastern border is\
      \ with South Carolina, which is along the Savannah River. Athens is not on the\
      \ border, but a bit inland. So, perhaps around 83.5\xB0W. Whereas Evanston,\
      \ IL is near Chicago, which is at about 87.6\xB0W. So if Athens is at 83.5\xB0\
      W, and Evanston is at 87.6\xB0W, then Athens is east of Evanston because 83.5\
      \ is less than 87.6 (since these are west longitudes). Wait, but longitude west\
      \ is measured as degrees west of the prime meridian. So a higher number means\
      \ further west. Therefore, Athens (lower longitude) is east of Evanston (higher\
      \ longitude). Therefore, the answer would be YES.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure\
      \ I'm not mixing up the directions. If a place is at 80\xB0W is further east\
      \ than a place at 90\xB0W. Because as you go west, the longitude numbers increase.\
      \ So yes, lower longitude (west) numbers are more east. Therefore, University\
      \ of Georgia in GA (around 83.5\xB0W) is east of Northwestern in IL (around\
      \ 87.6\xB0W). So the answer should be YES.\n</think>The University of Georgia\
      \ (UGA) is located in Athens, GA, which has a longitude of approximately **83.37\xB0\
      W**. Northwestern University is in Evanston, IL, with a longitude of approximately\
      \ **87.69\xB0W**. Since lower western longitudes (closer to 0\xB0 at the Prime\
      \ Meridian) indicate a more easterly position, Athens, GA (83.37\xB0W) lies\
      \ **east** of Evanston, IL (87.69\xB0W). \n\nANSWER: YES"

      \ the College of the University of Chicago in Illinois is east of the California\
      \ Institute of Technology in California. Let's start by recalling some basic\
      \ geography. \n\nFirst, I know that California is on the west coast of the United\
      \ States. Specifically, cities like Los Angeles, where Caltech is located, are\
      \ in the southern part of California. On the other hand, Chicago is in Illinois,\
      \ which is a midwestern state. But I need to be more precise about their longitudinal\
      \ positions.\n\nLongitude measures how far east or west a location is. The prime\

      , the University of Chicago is indeed east of Caltech. \n\nANSWER: YES"
    2934789f-1225-4f1c-9196-5ee92de4ba24: "<think>Alright, let's figure this out.\
      \ The question is whether the University of Chicago, IL is located east of the\
      \ California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in CA. \n\nFirst, I need to recall\
      \ where each of these institutions is located. The University of Chicago is\
      \ in Chicago, Illinois. Caltech is in Pasadena, California. So, I need to determine\
      \ the relative positions of Chicago and Pasadena in terms of east-west direction.\n\
      \nI know that in the United States, the eastern states are on the Atlantic coast,\
      \ like New York, Florida, etc., and the western states are on the Pacific coast,\
      \ like California, Oregon, Washington. Chicago is in the Midwest, which is more\
      \ towards the central part of the country. California is on the west coast.\
      \ So, intuitively, Chicago should be east of California. But I should confirm\
      \ the exact longitudes to be sure.\n\nLongitude measures how far east or west\
      \ a location is. The Prime Meridian is 0\xB0, and in the US, locations have\
      \ negative longitude values because they are west of the Prime Meridian. The\
      \ more negative the longitude, the further west it is. So, if Chicago's longitude\
      \ is less negative (closer to zero) than Pasadena's, then Chicago is east of\
      \ Pasadena.\n\nLooking up the coordinates: The University of Chicago is approximately\
      \ at 41.7897\xB0 N, 87.5997\xB0 W. Caltech is around 34.1377\xB0 N, 118.1253\xB0\
      \ W. \n\nComparing the longitudes: Chicago is -87.5997, and Caltech is -118.1253.\
      \ Since -87.6 is a smaller number (less negative) than -118.1, Chicago's longitude\
      \ is east of Caltech's. Therefore, the University of Chicago is indeed east\
      \ of Caltech in California.\n\nWait, just to double-check, because sometimes\
      \ I might mix up east and west. If a place has a higher longitude value (closer\
      \ to zero), it's more east. So, since Chicago's longitude is -87.6 versus Caltech's\
      \ -118.1, Chicago is east. Yes, that's correct. East is towards the Atlantic,\
      \ so moving from west to east, you go from higher negative to lower negative\
      \ longitudes. So, the answer should be YES.\n</think>The University of Chicago,\

      \ Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, CA, is at approximately 118.1\xB0\
      \ W. Since a smaller (less negative) longitude value indicates a position farther\
      \ east, Chicago lies east of Pasadena. \n\nYES."

      \ step by step. So the user wants to know if the College of the University of\

      \ University of Chicago is in Chicago, Illinois. Caltech is in Pasadena, California.\
      \ \n\nNow, I should figure out the geographical positions relative to each other.\
      \ Let me recall that the United States is generally laid out with the East Coast\
      \ on the right (east) and the West Coast on the left (west). Chicago is a major\
      \ city in the Midwest, while Pasadena is on the West Coast. \n\nTo determine\
      \ east or west, longitude is key. Places with a higher longitude (more east)\
      \ are further east. Wait, no, longitude lines run north-south, and east longitude\
      \ increases towards the east. But in the US, cities on the East Coast (like\
      \ New York) have a lower longitude in terms of west longitude because they are\
      \ east but in the Western Hemisphere. Wait, I need to clarify this.\n\nActually,\
      \ in the context of the Earth, the prime meridian is 0\xB0, and longitude increases\
      \ east and west up to 180\xB0. However, for the United States, all longitudes\
      \ are west of the prime meridian, so they are all in the western hemisphere.\
      \ So Chicago and Pasadena would both have west longitude coordinates. The further\
      \ east a location is within the US, the smaller (lesser) the longitude value\
      \ because it's closer to the prime meridian. For example, New York City has\
      \ a longitude of around 74\xB0W, Chicago is about 87\xB0W, and Los Angeles (near\
      \ Pasadena) is around 118\xB0W. Wait, no, that's inverted. Wait, longitude west\
      \ means how far west you are from the prime meridian. So higher west longitude\
      \ numbers are further west. So Chicago is at approximately 87\xB0W, and Pasadena\
      \ is around 118\xB0W. Therefore, Chicago is east of Pasadena because 87\xB0\
      W is east of 118\xB0W. Because as the longitude number increases westward, the\
      \ further west you are. So if one place has a lower west longitude than another,\
      \ it's to the east.\n\nSo, since the University of Chicago is around 87\xB0\
      W and Caltech is around 118\xB0W, Chicago is east of Caltech. So the answer\
      \ should be YES.\n</think>The University of Chicago is located in Chicago, Illinois\

      \ Duke University's Graduate School in North Carolina is east of the University\
      \ of Texas at Austin's College of Liberal Arts in Texas.\n\nFirst, I need to\
      \ recall the locations of both universities. Duke University is in North Carolina,\
      \ specifically in Durham. The University of Texas at Austin is, as the name\
      \ suggests, in Austin, Texas. \n\nNow, I should think about the geographic positions\
      \ of these two states. Texas is in the southern part of the United States, and\
      \ North Carolina is on the East Coast. But I need to compare their longitudinal\
      \ positions because east and west are determined by longitude. \n\nI know that\
      \ the further east a location is, the higher its longitude value (in the Western\
      \ Hemisphere, longitude is measured as west of the prime meridian, so lower\
      \ numbers are further east). Wait, no, actually, longitude in the US is measured\
      \ in degrees west, so a smaller longitude number would mean it's further east.\
      \ For example, New York is around 74 degrees west, while Los Angeles is around\
      \ 118 degrees west. So a place with a smaller longitude (closer to 0) is more\
      \ east.\n\nSo I need to find the approximate longitudes of Durham, NC, and Austin,\
      \ TX. Let me try to remember or estimate. \n\nDurham, NC: I think North Carolina\
      \ is on the East Coast. Major cities there like Charlotte or Raleigh have longitudes\
      \ around 78-80 degrees west. Durham is near Raleigh, so maybe around 78.8 degrees\
      \ west.\n\nAustin, TX: Texas is much further west. For example, Houston is around\
      \ 95 degrees west, but Austin is a bit further west than Houston. Wait, no,\
      \ Houston is on the eastern side of Texas. Austin is more central. So maybe\
      \ Austin's longitude is around 97.7 degrees west. Let me verify that. \n\nIf\
      \ I recall correctly, the approximate longitude for Austin is indeed about 97.7\
      \ degrees west. So Durham, NC is at approximately 78.8\xB0W, and Austin, TX\
      \ is around 97.7\xB0W. \n\nComparing those two, Durham has a smaller longitude\
      \ (78.8 vs. 97.7), which means it's further east. Therefore, Duke's Graduate\
      \ School in NC is east of UT Austin's College of Liberal Arts in Texas. \n\n\
      Wait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing up east and west. Since the Earth\
      \ is a sphere, technically, if you go far enough east, you end up west. But\
      \ within the contiguous US, all locations are west of the prime meridian. So,\
      \ in the US, a lower longitude (closer to 0) is further east. So yes, Durham's\

      First, I need to figure out the locations of both universities. Duke University\
      \ is in North Carolina, specifically in Durham, I believe. The University of\
      \ Texas at Austin is, as the name says, in Austin, Texas. \n\nNow, I need to\
      \ determine their relative east-west positions. The key here is comparing the\
      \ longitude of Durham, NC, and Austin, TX. Places with a lower longitude (more\
      \ to the west) are further west, and higher longitude (more to the east) are\
      \ further east. \n\nWait, no. Actually, longitude lines run north-south. The\
      \ prime meridian is 0 degrees, and longitude increases as you go east or west\
      \ from there. But in the US, all locations are west of the prime meridian, so\
      \ their longitude is measured in degrees west. So a higher longitude value (more\
      \ west) would actually mean a location is further west. Wait, no. Let me clarify.\
      \ For example, in the US, the longitude is typically given as a negative number\
      \ because it's west of the prime meridian. So Austin, Texas, is around 97.7\
      \ degrees west longitude, which would be -97.7 in decimal terms. Durham, NC,\
      \ I think is around 78.9 degrees west, so -78.9. \n\nSo comparing the longitudes:\
      \ Austin is at -97.7, Durham is at -78.9. Since -78.9 is greater than -97.7\
      \ (because it's less negative), that means Durham is further east than Austin.\
      \ Wait, is that right? Yes, because moving east from Austin would decrease the\
      \ numerical value of the longitude (since you're moving towards the prime meridian).\
      \ For example, New York is at around -74 longitude, which is east of Durham.\
      \ So if Durham is at -78.9 and Austin at -97.7, Durham is east of Austin. \n\

      \ hemisphere?), wait, no. Wait, longitude lines run north-south, and east longitude\
      \ is measured from the prime meridian. But in the US, all locations are west\
      \ of the prime meridian, so they have west longitude, which is typically denoted\
      \ as negative degrees when using decimal coordinates. So, for example, New York\
      \ City is around -74 degrees, and Los Angeles is around -118 degrees. The lower\
      \ the number (more negative), the further west it is. So if Durham, NC has a\
      \ higher (less negative) longitude than Austin, TX, then it's further east.\n\
      \nLet me recall the approximate longitudes. Austin, Texas is in central Texas.\
      \ I think Austin's longitude is around -97.7 degrees. Durham, North Carolina\
      \ is in the eastern part of NC. I believe Durham is around -78.9 degrees. So\

      \ NC is east of Austin, TX. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n\nWait, let\
      \ me double-check. Maybe I have the longitudes mixed up. Let me think of major\
      \ cities. For example, Dallas, TX is around -96.8, so Austin is a bit west of\
      \ Dallas? No, wait, Austin is actually a bit west of Dallas? Wait, no. Wait,\
      \ Texas is a big state. Let me check mentally: Texas is in the central time\

      \ in the eastern time zone are east of those in central. So that would mean\
      \ Durham, NC (Eastern Time) is east of Austin, TX (Central Time). So that supports\
      \ the idea that Duke is east of UT Austin. Therefore, the answer is YES.\n</think>To\
      \ determine if Duke University's Graduate School (Durham, NC) is east of the\

      \nLet me recall: the United States uses the western hemisphere longitudes, which\

      \ degrees or so, while Texas, being more to the west, would have a more negative\
      \ longitude. Wait, no, actually, longitude decreases as you go west. So Austin,\
      \ Texas is in the central part of the US, so its longitude would be around -97\
      \ degrees, maybe? And Durham, NC, being on the East Coast, would be around -78\
      \ or -79. \n\nLet me verify. I think Austin, TX is at approximately 97 degrees\
      \ west longitude, which would be -97.74 or something. For example, the coordinates\
      \ for Austin are roughly 30.2672\xB0 N, 97.7431\xB0 W. So that's about 97.74\
      \ degrees west. Duke University in Durham, NC: Durham's coordinates are approximately\

      \ \n\nComparing the two longitudes: -97.74 (Austin) vs. -78.89 (Durham). Since\

      \ 0\xB0 at Greenwich, UK, westward to 180\xB0). Wait, no, maybe I got that mixed\

      \ are west of the prime meridian, meaning they are negative when using the standard\

      \ For example, New York City is around -74\xB0 longitude, and Los Angeles is\
      \ around -118\xB0. So a more easterly location in the US would have a less negative\

      \ need to check their longitudes.\n\nDuke University is located in Durham, North\
      \ Carolina. Let me recall or estimate the longitude. North Carolina is on the\
      \ East Coast, so its longitude should be around, say, -78\xB0 or so. The University\
      \ of Texas at Austin is in Austin, Texas. Texas is further west, so Austin's\
      \ longitude would be around -97\xB0 or -98\xB0. Wait, but isn't that a big difference?\
      \ Let me confirm. For example, Durham, NC: I can look up approximate coordinates.\
      \ Let's say Durham is approximately 36\xB0N latitude, -78.9\xB0W longitude.\
      \ Austin, TX is around 30.25\xB0N, -97.75\xB0W. So Duke is at about -78.9\xB0\
      , and UT Austin is at -97.75\xB0. Since longitude decreases as you go west,\

      But wait, the question specifically mentions the Graduate School of Duke and\

      \ and then compare their longitudes to determine which one is further east.\n\
      \nLet me start with Duke University. I recall that Duke is in Durham, North\
      \ Carolina. Now, North Carolina is on the East Coast of the United States. But\
      \ where exactly is Durham located within the state? I think it's in the central\
      \ part of North Carolina, maybe a bit towards the east. But I'm not 100% sure.\
      \ I should probably check the approximate longitude of Durham, NC. Let me think...\

      \ longitude. Durham is near Raleigh, so maybe around the same longitude, say\
      \ 78.5\xB0W or so.\n\nNext, the University of Texas at Austin. Austin is the\
      \ capital of Texas, right? Texas is a big state in the southern central part\
      \ of the US. Austin is in central Texas. What's the longitude there? I remember\
      \ that Dallas is about 96.8\xB0W, and Austin is slightly to the west of Dallas?\
      \ Wait, no, actually, Austin is a bit more to the south and maybe a little west.\
      \ Wait, no, maybe Dallas is more north. Let me think. Texas spans a lot of longitudes.\
      \ Houston is around 95.4\xB0W. Austin is west of Houston. Maybe around 97.7\xB0\

      \ Wait, no, actually, in terms of east and west, lower longitude (closer to\

      \ NC (Duke) is east of Austin, TX (UT Austin). Therefore, the answer would be\
      \ YES.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the exact longitudes to be sure. Sometimes\
      \ I might mix up the numbers. Let me recall: New York City is around 74\xB0\
      W, so Durham, NC being in central NC would be a bit further west than NYC. So\

      \ is, as the name says, in Austin, Texas. So I need to compare the geographic\

      \ which is further east.\n\nI remember that the easternmost point of Texas is\
      \ probably not as far east as North Carolina. But let's get more precise. I\
      \ think Austin is in central Texas, so its longitude would be around 97 or 98\

      \ US. The longitude for Durham might be around 78 or 79 degrees west. \n\nWait,\

      \ is located. Duke University is in North Carolina, right? Specifically, I think\
      \ it's in Durham, NC. The University of Texas at Austin is obviously in Austin,\
      \ Texas.\n\nNext, I should compare their longitudes because east and west are\
      \ determined by longitude. The further east a location is (higher longitude\
      \ in the western hemisphere?), wait, no. Wait, longitude is measured from the\
      \ prime meridian. So in the US, which is west of the prime meridian, the eastern\
      \ states have lower longitude values (more west?) Hmm, maybe I should check\
      \ the actual coordinates.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. Longitude increases as\
      \ you go east from the prime meridian. But the US is west of the prime meridian,\
      \ so all longitudes are negative when expressed in decimal degrees (like -77\
      \ for Duke and -97 for Austin, perhaps). Wait, but when comparing eastness,\
      \ a less negative (closer to zero) longitude is further east. So for example,\
      \ New York is around -74, and Los Angeles is around -118. So New York is east\
      \ of LA because -74 is east (closer to zero) than -118.\n\nSo, if Duke's longitude\

      \ me check approximate longitudes.\n\nDuke University in Durham, NC: I think\
      \ Durham is around 78 degrees west longitude? Wait, no. Wait, US uses negative\
      \ for west. So Durham, NC is approximately 36 degrees latitude, -78.9 degrees\
      \ longitude. University of Texas at Austin: Austin, TX is approximately 30 degrees\
      \ latitude, -97.7 degrees longitude.\n\nComparing the longitudes: -78.9 (Duke)\

      \ to figure out the locations of both places and compare their longitudes.\n\
      \nFirst, I know that Duke University is in Durham, North Carolina. The University\
      \ of Texas at Austin is, of course, in Austin, Texas. So I need to find out\
      \ the approximate longitude of both cities to determine which is further east.\n\
      \nI remember that in the United States, the easternmost states are on the Atlantic\
      \ coast, like Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, etc. Texas is more in the central-southern\
      \ part, but where exactly is Austin compared to Durham?\n\nLet me think about\
      \ the general geography. North Carolina is on the East Coast, so cities there\
      \ like Raleigh, Durham, Charlotte are definitely in the Eastern Time Zone. Texas\
      \ is in the Central Time Zone, which is one hour behind. But time zones can\
      \ be a rough guide, but not exact for longitude. For example, some parts of\
      \ Texas might be closer to the Eastern Time Zone boundary, but I think most\
      \ of Texas is solidly in Central.\n\nSo Durham, NC is in the Eastern Time Zone,\
      \ and Austin, TX is in Central. That suggests that Durham is east of Austin.\
      \ But to be precise, I should check their actual longitudes.\n\nLooking up the\
      \ longitude of Durham, NC: I think it's around 78 degrees West. Austin, TX is\
      \ probably further west. Let me recall: Austin is in central Texas. The longitude\
      \ for Austin is approximately 97 degrees West. Wait, that can't be right. Wait,\
      \ no, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again. The prime meridian is 0 degrees,\
      \ going through Greenwich. The US is west of that, so all longitudes are west.\
      \ The east coast of the US is around 70-80 degrees West. For example, New York\
      \ is about 74 degrees West. North Carolina is south of there, so maybe Durham\
      \ is around 78-79 degrees West. Texas is much further west. For example, Dallas\
      \ is around 96-97 degrees West. Austin is a bit south of Dallas, but longitude-wise,\
      \ maybe similar. So Austin's longitude is around 97.5 degrees West. If Durham\
      \ is around 78 degrees West, then Durham is east of Austin because 78 is less\
      \ than 97.5 (since west longitude increases as you go west). So a lower longitude\
      \ number means further east.\n\nTherefore, Duke University in NC (longitude\
      \ ~78\xB0W) is east of UT Austin (longitude ~97\xB0W). So the answer should\
      \ be YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. **Locations Identified:**\

      \  \n   - Durham, NC: ~78.9\xB0W longitude.  \n   - Austin, TX: ~97.7\xB0W longitude.\
      \  \n3. **Directional Analysis:** Lower longitude (eastward) values are further\

      \ So, the user is asking whether the University of Virginia (UVA) in Virginia\
      \ is located east of Texas A&M University in Texas. Hmm, okay. First, I need\
      \ to figure out where each of these universities is located geographically within\
      \ their respective states.\n\nLet me start with the University of Virginia.\
      \ I know that UVA is in Charlottesville, Virginia. Virginia is on the East Coast\
      \ of the United States, so that's pretty far east. Now, Texas A&M is in College\
      \ Station, Texas. Texas is a big state in the southern central part of the U.S.,\
      \ right? So Texas A&M's location is in the eastern part of Texas, but Texas\
      \ as a whole is west of the East Coast states.\n\nTo get more precise, maybe\
      \ I should look at the longitude coordinates. Longitude determines how east\
      \ or west a location is. The further east (higher longitude in the western hemisphere?),\
      \ wait, actually, longitude lines run from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0) going\
      \ west to 180\xB0 and east to 180\xB0. Wait, no\u2014actually, in the Western\
      \ Hemisphere, longitude is measured west from the Prime Meridian, so higher\
      \ degrees west would be further west. For example, the U.S. has longitudes that\
      \ are west of the Prime Meridian, so they are in the negative when using decimal\
      \ degrees (like -77 for Virginia and -96 for Texas, maybe).\n\nSo Charlottesville,\
      \ VA: let me check its longitude. From what I remember, Charlottesville is around\
      \ 78 degrees west longitude. Texas A&M in College Station, TX: I think College\
      \ Station is near Houston, which is around 96 degrees west. Wait, no, Houston\
      \ is more like 95\xB0W. Wait, College Station is actually a bit northwest of\
      \ Houston. Let me confirm. Yes, College Station's longitude is approximately\
      \ 96.3\xB0W. So that's more west than Charlottesville. Charlottesville, VA is\
      \ around 78.47\xB0W. So since 78\xB0W is east of 96\xB0W, that would mean UVA\
      \ is east of Texas A&M.\n\nWait, but longitude: lower numbers (when west) are\
      \ further east. Because as you go west, the longitude increases. So 78\xB0W\
      \ is closer to the Prime Meridian (0\xB0) than 96\xB0W. So yes, Charlottesville\

      \ more easterly positions, UVA (78.47\xB0W) lies east of Texas A&M (96.33\xB0\
      W).  \n\n**Answer**: YES"
    2c8a6b27-ab3e-4a8b-a1a4-d873707f95d4: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question:\
      \ Is the University of Virginia (UVA) in Virginia located east of Texas A&M\
      \ University in Texas? Hmm, okay, first I need to figure out where each university\
      \ is located geographically. \n\nSo, starting with the University of Virginia.\
      \ I know that UVA is in Charlottesville, Virginia. Virginia is on the east coast\
      \ of the United States, right? It's one of the original 13 colonies, so definitely\
      \ in the eastern part of the country. I'm pretty sure Charlottesville is in\
      \ the central part of Virginia, but since the state itself is on the East Coast,\
      \ that places UVA quite far east.\n\nNow, Texas A&M is in College Station, Texas.\
      \ Texas is a big state in the southern central part of the US. College Station\
      \ is somewhere in eastern Texas, but how far east exactly? I think it's not\
      \ right on the coast, but more inland. The eastern border of Texas is along\
      \ the Louisiana state line. So College Station is probably west of that border\
      \ but still in the eastern half of Texas.\n\nWait, but the key here is comparing\
      \ their longitudes. The further east a location is, the higher its longitude\
      \ (in the western hemisphere, longitude decreases as you go west). So if UVA\
      \ has a higher longitude (more east) than Texas A&M, then the answer is yes.\
      \ But maybe I should check approximate longitudes.\n\nLet me recall or estimate.\
      \ Virginia's longitude for Charlottesville. From what I remember, the approximate\
      \ longitude for Charlottesville, VA is around -78.5 degrees. For College Station,\
      \ TX, maybe around -96.3 degrees. Wait, longitude is measured from the prime\
      \ meridian, with values west of it being negative in the US. So, a smaller number\
      \ (less negative) means further east. Wait, no. Wait, longitude in the US is\
      \ west of the prime meridian, so all the US has negative longitude values. The\
      \ more negative the longitude (i.e., the lower the number), the further west\
      \ it is. So, Charlottesville at -78.5, College Station at -96.3. Wait, no, that\
      \ can't be right. Wait, maybe I got that backwards. Let me think. For example,\
      \ New York City is around -74 degrees, so it's more east (less negative) than,\
      \ say, Chicago at -87.6. So, the more east you are, the closer to 0 the longitude\
      \ is. So, Charlottesville at around -78.5 would be east of College Station if\
      \ College Station has a longitude more west (more negative). \n\nWait, if College\
      \ Station, TX is at -96.3, then that's more west than Charlottesville's -78.5.\
      \ Wait, but -96 is more west than -78 because it's a larger negative number.\
      \ So yes, College Station is west of Charlottesville, which would mean Charlottesville\
      \ (UVA) is east of Texas A&M. Therefore, the answer would be YES. \n\nAlternatively,\
      \ maybe I should confirm the exact coordinates. Let me see, from memory approximate\
      \ coordinates. Charlottesville, VA's longitude is roughly 78 degrees west, which\
      \ is -78. College Station, TX's longitude is around 96 degrees west, so -96.\

      \ lower numbers? Wait, no. Longitude is measured from the prime meridian, which\

      \ is at -78.48, Texas A&M at -96.34. Since longitude increases as you go west\
      \ (in the western hemisphere), a more negative number means further west. So\

      \ \n\nWait, yes. Because if you have two points in the western hemisphere, the\
      \ one with the smaller longitude value (more west, more negative) is further\
      \ west. So since -96.34 is smaller (more negative) than -78.48, College Station\

      \ the University of Virginia (UVA) in Virginia is located east of Texas A&M\
      \ University in Texas. Let me start by recalling the geographic locations of\
      \ both states. Virginia is on the east coast of the US, right? It's one of the\
      \ original 13 colonies, so it's definitely on the Atlantic side. Texas is in\
      \ the southern part of the country, more towards the central and southwest areas.\
      \ But where exactly is Texas A&M? \n\nTexas A&M is in College Station, Texas.\
      \ Let me confirm that. Yes, the main campus is in College Station. Now, where\
      \ is College Station located within Texas? I think it's in the eastern part\
      \ of Texas, but not right on the border. Maybe central-east? Let me visualize\
      \ a map. Texas is a big state. If I imagine Texas, the major cities like Houston,\
      \ Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio come to mind. College Station is actually\
      \ northeast of Austin and between Houston and Dallas. So that would place it\
      \ in the central-eastern part of Texas.\n\nNow, the University of Virginia is\
      \ in Charlottesville, Virginia. Charlottesville is in the central part of Virginia,\
      \ but since Virginia itself is on the east coast, even the central part is still\
      \ east compared to many other states. So, comparing the longitudes of both places\
      \ should determine which is further east. \n\nBut how do their longitudes compare?\
      \ I know that the US becomes more westward as you go from the east coast towards\
      \ the central and mountain time zones. The prime meridian is in Greenwich, so\
      \ locations in the eastern US have longitudes that are west of the prime meridian\
      \ (negative numbers). For example, New York City is around -74 degrees longitude,\
      \ while Los Angeles is around -118. \n\nSo Virginia's longitude would be somewhere\
      \ west of, say, -75 to maybe -80 degrees. Texas is further west. College Station,\
      \ Texas, I think has a longitude around -96.3 degrees. Let me check that. Wait,\
      \ maybe I should approximate. If Virginia is on the east coast, its longitude\
      \ is more easterly (less negative) than Texas. For instance, Charlottesville,\
      \ VA is approximately at -78.4 degrees longitude. College Station, TX is around\
      \ -96.3 degrees. Since longitude decreases as you go west, the more negative\
      \ the number, the further west it is. So -78 is east of -96. That means UVA\
      \ is east of Texas A&M. \n\nWait, but I need to confirm the exact longitudes.\
      \ Let me think again. If College Station is at approximately 96.3\xB0 West,\
      \ and Charlottesville is at 78.4\xB0 West, then Charlottesville is indeed east\
      \ because 78.4\xB0W is less than 96.3\xB0W. So yes, the University of Virginia\

      \ I know that the University of Virginia is in Charlottesville, Virginia. Virginia\

      \ to Virginia. \n\nWait, but I need to be precise. Let me recall the approximate\
      \ longitudes. Longitude measures east-west position. The further east a place\
      \ is, the higher (more negative if we're in the western hemisphere) its longitude.\
      \ Wait, no, actually, in the US, all longitudes are west, so they're negative\
      \ numbers. So a more easterly location would have a less negative (higher) longitude.\
      \ For example, Virginia is around, say, 78 degrees west longitude for Charlottesville.\
      \ Texas A&M in College Station is around 96 degrees west longitude. Wait, no,\
      \ wait. Let me check that.\n\nWait, no, maybe I have that backwards. The prime\
      \ meridian is 0 degrees, and as you go west, the longitude increases in the\
      \ negative direction. So, for example, New York is around 74 degrees west, which\
      \ is -74. Texas is further west, so College Station would be around 96 degrees\
      \ west (-96), while Charlottesville, VA is around 78 degrees west (-78). So\
      \ since -78 is east of -96, that means UVA is east of Texas A&M. \n\nWait, but\
      \ longitude: lower numerical value (less west) means more east. So yes, 78\xB0\
      W is east of 96\xB0W. So Charlottesville is east of College Station. Therefore,\
      \ the answer would be YES. \n\nBut let me make sure I'm not mixing up the directions.\
      \ If you have two points in the western hemisphere, the one with the smaller\
      \ longitude (closer to 0) is more east. For example, 75\xB0W is east of 100\xB0\
      W. So yes, Virginia is around 78\xB0W, Texas A&M is around 96\xB0W. Therefore,\
      \ UVA is east of Texas A&M. So the answer is YES.\n</think>YES  \nThe University\

      \ is further east.\n\nWait, longitude measures east-west position. Places with\
      \ a higher longitude (more east) have a higher number if we're using the eastern\
      \ hemisphere, but in the western hemisphere, longitude is measured west from\
      \ the Prime Meridian. So for the US, all longitudes are west, so they're negative\

      \ longitude numbers (more east) mean further east. \n\nWait, longitude lines\
      \ decrease as you go east? No, longitude is measured from the Prime Meridian\
      \ (0\xB0), with values increasing westward up to 180\xB0 in the Pacific. So\

      \ in some systems, but in the US, we refer to them as west longitude, so 78\xB0\
      W is 78 degrees west of the Prime Meridian. Therefore, the further east a place\
      \ is in the US, the smaller the longitude number. So Charlottesville at 78\xB0\
      W is east of College Station at, say, 96\xB0W. Because 78 is less than 96, meaning\

      \nFirst, I should recall where each of these cities is. Boston is in Massachusetts,\

      \ The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific\
      \ Ocean on the west. So if you compare two points, one on each coast, the one\
      \ on the east coast (Boston) would have a higher longitude (more east) than\
      \ the one on the west coast (San Francisco). \n\nBut maybe I should check the\
      \ actual longitudes. Let me think. Longitude lines run north-south, and they\
      \ measure east or west from the Prime Meridian. Places to the west have negative\
      \ longitudes in the western hemisphere. So San Francisco's longitude is around\
      \ 122 degrees West, I think. And Boston is somewhere around 71 degrees West.\
      \ Wait, no, if Boston is on the east coast, its longitude would actually be\
      \ around 71 degrees West because the east coast is still in the western hemisphere\
      \ but further east than the west coast. \n\nSo, for example, New York City is\
      \ about 74 degrees West, Boston is a bit more east, maybe 71 degrees West. San\
      \ Francisco is around 122 degrees West. Since longitude decreases as you go\
      \ east (because you're moving closer to the Prime Meridian which is 0 degrees),\
      \ Boston at 71\xB0W is east of San Francisco at 122\xB0W because 71 is a smaller\
      \ number than 122 when measuring west longitude. Wait, but in terms of east\
      \ longitude, the higher the number, the further east you are. But since both\
      \ are in the western hemisphere, their longitudes are west. So the lower the\
      \ number (closer to 0), the further east the location is. So Boston, being at\
      \ a lower west longitude (71\xB0W) is indeed east of San Francisco (122\xB0\
      W). \n\nTherefore, Boston University in MA is east of UC San Francisco, CA.\
      \ So the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\
      \  \n1. **Locations:** Boston University is in Boston, MA (east coast); UC San\
      \ Francisco is in San Francisco, CA (west coast).  \n2. **Longitude Comparison:**\
      \  \n   - Boston, MA: ~71\xB0W longitude.  \n   - San Francisco, CA: ~122\xB0\
      W longitude.  \n3. **East vs. West Longitude:** Lower numerical longitude (closer\
      \ to 0\xB0) in the western hemisphere means further east.  \n4. **Conclusion:**\
      \ 71\xB0W (Boston) is east of 122\xB0W (San Francisco).  \n\n**Answer:** YES."

      \ whether Boston University in Massachusetts is east of the University of California,\

      \ a city on the East Coast of the United States. Boston University is in Boston,\
      \ MA. On the other hand, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)\
      \ is in San Francisco, CA, which is on the West Coast. Generally, East Coast\
      \ cities are east of West Coast cities because the US spans from the Atlantic\
      \ Ocean on the east to the Pacific Ocean on the west. So, Boston should be east\
      \ of San Francisco.\n\nBut maybe I should check the exact longitudes to be sure.\
      \ Longitude measures how far east or west a place is from the prime meridian.\
      \ Places with higher east longitude are further east. Wait, no\u2014actually,\
      \ in the US, all longitudes are west of the prime meridian, so they're measured\
      \ as west longitude. So the smaller the longitude number (more negative if using\
      \ decimal degrees west as negative), the further east the location is. \n\n\
      Let me look up the approximate coordinates. Boston, MA: I think its longitude\
      \ is around -71 degrees. San Francisco, CA: I recall the Golden Gate Bridge\
      \ is at about -122 degrees, so the city's longitude would be similar. Comparing\
      \ -71 and -122, -71 is to the east because it's a smaller negative number (closer\
      \ to zero). Therefore, Boston is indeed east of San Francisco. So Boston University,\
      \ being in Boston, is east of UCSF in San Francisco. \n\nWait, but does the\
      \ University of California, San Francisco have its main campus exactly in the\
      \ city? I believe UCSF's main campus is in San Francisco proper, yes. Boston\
      \ University is definitely in Boston. So their locations correspond to the cities.\

      \ San Francisco, on the West Coast, has a longitude of approximately **-122\xB0\

      \ is indeed east of UCSF."
    6cd2a787-d105-47ca-af6e-8ec60222d091: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Boston University in Massachusetts is east of the University of California,\
      \ San Francisco in California. Let me start by recalling the locations of both\
      \ cities. \n\nBoston University is in Boston, MA. I know Boston is on the east\
      \ coast of the United States, right? Like, Massachusetts is part of New England,\
      \ and cities there like Boston are definitely on the Atlantic side.\n\nOn the\
      \ other hand, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) is in San Francisco,\
      \ CA. San Francisco is on the west coast, in California. So California is a\
      \ west coast state, facing the Pacific Ocean.\n\nNow, to determine east or west\
      \ relative positions, I think longitude is the key here. Places with a higher\
      \ longitude (more to the east) are further east. Wait, no, longitude is measured\
      \ from the prime meridian. So in the US, the eastern parts have a lower longitude\
      \ (since they're west of the prime meridian), but when comparing within the\
      \ US, west coast cities like San Francisco have a more western longitude (i.e.,\
      \ a higher negative number) compared to east coast cities like Boston.\n\nWait,\
      \ confusing. Let me think. The prime meridian is 0 degrees, and longitude increases\
      \ to the east and west. But in the US, all longitudes are west of the prime\
      \ meridian, so they are in the western hemisphere. So Boston's longitude is\
      \ around 71 degrees west, and San Francisco is around 122 degrees west. Wait,\
      \ that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, longitude for Boston is approximately\
      \ 71 degrees west (since it's on the east coast), and San Francisco is around\
      \ 122 degrees west. Since longitude west is measured from 0 to 180 west. So\
      \ Boston is at about 71\xB0W, and San Francisco is about 122\xB0W. \n\nWait,\
      \ but if a place is more to the west (like San Francisco), its longitude is\
      \ a larger number in the west direction. So San Francisco is at a higher degree\
      \ west than Boston. That means Boston is east of San Francisco because it's\
      \ at a lower west longitude. Because 71\xB0W is east of 122\xB0W. So if you\
      \ have two points in the western hemisphere, the one with the smaller longitude\
      \ (closer to zero) is further east. \n\nSo Boston, being at around 71\xB0W,\
      \ is east of San Francisco, which is at 122\xB0W. So yes, Boston University\
      \ is east of UCSF. Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \n**Step-by-Step\
      \ Explanation:**  \n1. **Identify Locations:** Boston University is in Boston,\

    7461b712-9ace-4175-95fc-3975f517d9cc: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure this\

      \ see which one is further east.\n\nFirst, I know that Boston is a city on the\
      \ east coast of the United States, in Massachusetts. The University of California,\
      \ San Francisco is in San Francisco, which is on the west coast, in California.\
      \ Generally, the east coast is to the east of the west coast, so Boston should\
      \ be east of San Francisco. But maybe there's some nuance here.\n\nWait, to\
      \ be precise, I should check the longitudes of both cities. Longitude measures\
      \ how far east or west a location is. Places with higher longitude numbers (east\
      \ longitude) are further east, but in the case of the US, all longitudes are\
      \ west, so a lower (more negative) longitude means further west. So, the more\
      \ east a place is, the less negative its longitude. For example, Boston's longitude\
      \ is around 71 degrees west, and San Francisco's is around 122 degrees west.\
      \ Since 71 is less than 122 (when considering west as negative, -71 vs. -122),\

      \ Therefore, Boston University, being in Boston, is east of UCSF in San Francisco.\
      \ \n\nBut wait, are there any exceptions or mistakes in my understanding? Let\
      \ me confirm. If I look at a map of the US, Boston is on the Atlantic coast,\

      \ Yes, the East Coast is definitely east of the West Coast. So the answer should\
      \ be yes. But maybe I should double-check the exact coordinates.\n\nLooking\
      \ up Boston University's coordinates: I think Boston University is in Boston,\
      \ MA. The coordinates for Boston are approximately 42.35\xB0 N latitude, 71.06\xB0\
      \ W longitude. UCSF's main campus is in San Francisco, which is around 37.76\xB0\
      \ N, 122.45\xB0 W. Comparing the longitudes: Boston is at 71.06\xB0W, San Francisco\
      \ at 122.45\xB0W. Since longitude increases westward in the Western Hemisphere,\
      \ a lower numerical value (less west) means more east. So 71.06\xB0W is east\
      \ of 122.45\xB0W. Therefore, Boston is indeed east of San Francisco. Hence,\
      \ Boston University is east of UCSF. The answer is yes.\n</think>YES. Boston\
