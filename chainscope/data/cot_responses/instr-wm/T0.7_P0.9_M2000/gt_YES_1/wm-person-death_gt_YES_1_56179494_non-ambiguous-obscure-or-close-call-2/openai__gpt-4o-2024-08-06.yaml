      1. **Paul Newman**: He was an American actor and philanthropist who died on

      2. **Sun Tzu**: He was an ancient Chinese military strategist and philosopher

      1. **Sun Tzu**: Sun Tzu was an ancient Chinese general, military strategist,
      and philosopher who is traditionally credited as the author of "The Art of War."
      He is believed to have lived during the Eastern Zhou period, approximately between
      544 BC and 496 BC. Therefore, Sun Tzu died around 496 BC.

      driver, and philanthropist. He was born on January 26, 1925, and died on September
