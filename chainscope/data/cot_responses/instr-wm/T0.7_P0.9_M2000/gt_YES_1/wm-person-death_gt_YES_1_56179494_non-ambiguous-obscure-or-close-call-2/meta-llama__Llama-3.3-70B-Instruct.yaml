      Now, comparing the dates of death:


      - Charles de Gaulle died on November 9, 1970.

      - Idi Amin died on August 16, 2003.


      Given that 2003 is indeed later than 1970, we can conclude that Idi Amin died

      \ Mugabe died in 2019 CE.\n\n2. **Compare the death dates:**\n   - Alexander\
      \ the Great passed away in 323 BCE, which is before the Common Era (BCE).\n\
      \   - Robert Mugabe passed away in 2019 CE, which is in the Common Era (CE).\n\
      \n3. **Determine the relationship between BCE and CE:**\n   - BCE counts down\
      \ to 1, then the era changes to CE, which starts counting up from 1.\n   - Therefore,\
      \ any date in CE is after any date in BCE.\n\n4. **Conclusion based on the comparison:**\n\

      II of Russia and then compare them.


      1. **Identify Catherine II of Russia''s date of death**: Catherine II, also
      known as Catherine the Great, was the Empress of Russia from 1762 until her
      death in 1796.


      2. **Identify Jimmy Carter''s status**: As of my last update, Jimmy Carter,
      the 39th President of the United States, was still alive. He was born on October
      1, 1924.


      3. **Compare the dates**: Since Catherine II of Russia died in 1796 and Jimmy
      Carter is still alive (as of my last update), it means Jimmy Carter has not
      died yet, which automatically places his potential date of death (whenever it
      may occur) at a later time than Catherine II of Russia''s death in 1796.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Jimmy Carter died at a later date than Catherine
      II of Russia is: **YES**'

      1. **Catherine II of Russia''s death date**: Catherine II, also known as Catherine
      the Great, died on November 17, 1796.


      2. **Jimmy Carter''s status**: As of my last update, Jimmy Carter, the 39th
      President of the United States, was born on October 1, 1924, and is still alive.


      Given these facts, since Jimmy Carter is still alive, he has not died. Therefore,
      he has not died at any date, let alone a later date than Catherine II of Russia,
      who died in 1796.


      So, considering the question is about whether Jimmy Carter died at a later date
      than Catherine II of Russia, and knowing Jimmy Carter has not died, the answer
      reflects the fact that there''s no death date for Jimmy Carter to compare with
      Catherine II''s death date.

      Given these steps, the answer to whether Jimmy Carter died at a later date than
      Catherine II of Russia is **YES**. This answer is based on the fact that Jimmy

      1. **Genghis Khan''s Death**: Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol Empire,
      is believed to have died in 1227. The exact date of his death is not certain,
      but it is generally accepted to be around August 1227.

      Cohen was born on September 21, 1934. He passed away on November 7, 2016.


      2. **Ferdinand Magellan**: A Portuguese explorer who led the first expedition
      to circumnavigate the globe, Ferdinand Magellan was born around 1480. He died
      on April 27, 1521, during his voyage, in the Philippines.


      Now, comparing the death dates:

      - Leonard Cohen died on November 7, 2016.

      - Ferdinand Magellan died on April 27, 1521.


      Given these dates, it''s clear that Leonard Cohen died much later than Ferdinand
      Magellan.

      let''s determine the dates of death for both Kofi Annan and Oskar Schindler.


      1. **Kofi Annan''s Date of Death**: Kofi Annan was a Ghanaian diplomat who served
      as the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1997 to
      December 2006. He passed away on August 18, 2018.


      2. **Oskar Schindler''s Date of Death**: Oskar Schindler was a German industrialist
      and a member of the Nazi Party who is credited with saving the lives of approximately
      1,200 Jews during the Holocaust. He died on October 9, 1974.


      Now, comparing the two dates:


      - Kofi Annan died on August 18, 2018.

      - Oskar Schindler died on October 9, 1974.


      Given that 2018 is later than 1974, it follows that Kofi Annan died at a later
      date than Oskar Schindler.


      The answer is: **YES**'
