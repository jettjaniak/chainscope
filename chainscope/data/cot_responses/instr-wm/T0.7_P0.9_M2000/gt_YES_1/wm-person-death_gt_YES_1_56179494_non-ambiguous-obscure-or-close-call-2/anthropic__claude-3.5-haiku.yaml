    dc730a2b-d9e8-4fcb-882f-3dab1393ab71: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated on June 28, 1914 in Sarajevo, which
      triggered World War I.


      2. Peter I (also known as Peter the Liberator) was the King of Serbia from 1903
      to 1918.


      3. Peter I lived from 1844 to 1921.


      4. Since Peter I died in 1921, which is after 1914, and Archduke Franz Ferdinand
      died in 1914, this means Peter I died at a later date than Franz Ferdinand.


      5. Therefore, the answer to the question "Did Archduke Franz Ferdinand die at
      a later date than Peter I?" is NO.


      The answer is NO.'
