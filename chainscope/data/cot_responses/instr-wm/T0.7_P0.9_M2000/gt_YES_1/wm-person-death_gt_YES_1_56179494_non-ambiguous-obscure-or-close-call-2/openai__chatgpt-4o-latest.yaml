      of death.


      Step 1: Determine when Josef Mengele died.

      - Josef Mengele was a Nazi doctor who fled to South America after World War
      II.

      - He died in 1979 in Brazil, although his death was not confirmed until years
      later.


      Step 2: Determine when Nelson Mandela died.

      - Nelson Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary and president.

      - He died on December 5, 2013.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      - Josef Mengele: 1979

      - Nelson Mandela: 2013


      2013 is later than 1979.

      Oswald die at a later date than Piotr I?" we need to consider the dates of death
      for both individuals.


      Step 1: Identify who Lee Harvey Oswald was.

      - Lee Harvey Oswald is known as the alleged assassin of U.S. President John
      F. Kennedy.

      - He died shortly after Kennedy''s assassination, which occurred on November
      22, 1963.

      - Oswald himself was shot and killed on November 24, 1963.


      Step 2: Identify who Piotr I was.

      - Piotr I is the Russian name for Peter the Great, a prominent Tsar and later
      Emperor of Russia.

      - Peter the Great died in the early 18th century.

      - His date of death was February 8, 1725.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      - Lee Harvey Oswald: November 24, 1963.

      - Piotr I (Peter the Great): February 8, 1725.


      1963 is clearly later than 1725.
