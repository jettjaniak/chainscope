      the dates of death for both historical figures:


      1. **Bob Marley**: He was a Jamaican singer-songwriter who died on May 11, 1981.

      2. **H. G. Wells**: He was an English writer who died on August 13, 1946.


      Given these dates, we can see that Bob Marley died in 1981 and H. G. Wells died
      in 1946.


      Since 1981 is indeed a later date than 1946, the answer to whether Bob Marley

      Now, let''s compare the dates:


      - Andy Warhol died in 1987.

      - Marco Polo died in 1324.


      Since 1987 is later than 1324, we can conclude that Andy Warhol died at a later
      date than Marco Polo.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'

      - Karl Marx died in 1883.

      2. **Genghis Khan**: He was the founder and first Great Khan of the Mongol Empire.
      Genghis Khan died on August 18, 1227.


      Now, let''s compare these dates:


      - Joan of Arc died in 1431.

      the death dates of Leonard Cohen and Ferdinand Magellan.


      1. **Leonard Cohen**: He was a Canadian singer-songwriter, poet, and novelist.
      He died on November 7, 2016.


      2. **Ferdinand Magellan**: He was a Portuguese explorer who led the first expedition
      to sail around the world. He died on April 27, 1521.


      Now, let''s compare their death dates:


      - Leonard Cohen died in 2016.

      - Ferdinand Magellan died in 1521.


      Since 2016 is later than 1521, we can conclude that Leonard Cohen died at a

      1. **Kofi Annan**: Kofi Annan was a Ghanaian diplomat who served as the seventh
      Secretary-General of the United Nations. He died on August 18, 2018.

      2. **Oskar Schindler**: Oskar Schindler was a German industrialist who saved
      the lives of over a thousand Jews during the Holocaust. He died on October 9,
      1974.


      Now, let''s compare these dates:


      - Kofi Annan died in 2018.

      - Oskar Schindler died in 1974.


      Given that 2018 is later than 1974, we can conclude that Kofi Annan indeed died
      at a later date than Oskar Schindler.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      the dates of death for both J. R. R. Tolkien and William Shakespeare.


      1. First, let''s find out when William Shakespeare died. William Shakespeare,
      the famous English playwright and poet, died on April 23, 1616.


      2. Next, we need to find out when J. R. R. Tolkien died. J. R. R. Tolkien, the
      English writer, poet, and philologist, died on September 2, 1973.


      3. Now, we compare the two dates. Since 1973 is later than 1616, J. R. R. Tolkien
      died at a later date than William Shakespeare.


      The answer is: **YES**'
