    0659258e-c6a8-4452-8e7f-99fb451520a8: 'To answer this question,
      let''s first establish the dates of death for both historical figures:


      1. **Bob Marley**: He was a Jamaican singer-songwriter who died on May 11, 1981.

      2. **H. G. Wells**: He was an English writer who died on August 13, 1946.


      Given these dates, we can see that Bob Marley died in 1981 and H. G. Wells died
      in 1946.


      Since 1981 is indeed a later date than 1946, the answer to whether Bob Marley
      died at a later date than H. G. Wells is YES.

      date than Marco Polo.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'

      Now, let''s compare these dates:


      - Ferdinand Marcos died in 1989.

      - Robert F. Kennedy died in 1968.


      Since 1989 is indeed a later date than 1968, the answer to whether Ferdinand
      Marcos died at a later date than Robert F. Kennedy is YES.

      let''s first establish the dates of death for both Anne Frank and Isaac Newton.


      1. **Anne Frank**: Anne Frank, a Jewish victim of the Holocaust, died in early
      March 1945 in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.


      2. **Isaac Newton**: Isaac Newton, the renowned English mathematician and physicist,

      Great, was a Russian czar who died on February 8, 1725.

      3. Now, we compare the two dates. Since 1963 is later than 1725, Lee Harvey
      Oswald indeed died at a later date than Piotr I.

      1. Grigori Rasputin, the Russian mystic and self-proclaimed holy man, died on
      December 30, 1916.

      2. Friedrich Nitzsch, the German philosopher, died on August 25, 1900.


      Now, let''s compare these dates:


      - Grigori Rasputin died in 1916.

      - Friedrich Nitzsch died in 1900.


      Since 1916 is later than 1900, we can conclude that Grigori Rasputin indeed
