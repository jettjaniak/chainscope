      Step 1: Determine when Jane Austen lived and died.

      - Jane Austen was born on December 16, 1775.

      - She died on July 18, 1817, at the age of 41.


      Step 2: Determine when historical Jesus lived and died.

      - Jesus is generally believed to have been born around 4-6 BCE.

      - Historical consensus places his death around 30-33 CE, when he was in his
      30s.


      Step 3: Compare the death dates.

      - Jesus died around 30-33 CE (the first century).

      - Jane Austen died in 1817 CE (the 19th century).

      - 1817 CE is approximately 1,784 years after 33 CE.


      Therefore, Jane Austen died at a much later date than historical Jesus.

      Step 1: Identify when Paul Newman died.

      Paul Newman was an American actor who died on September 26, 2008.


      Step 2: Identify when Sun Tzu died.

      Sun Tzu was an ancient Chinese military strategist and philosopher, author of
      "The Art of War." He is believed to have lived during the Eastern Zhou period
      of ancient China, around the late 6th to early 5th century BCE (approximately
      544-496 BCE).

      Sun Tzu was an ancient Chinese military strategist and philosopher who is believed
      to have lived during the Eastern Zhou period. Historical records suggest he
      died around 496 BCE (Before Common Era).

      2008 CE is much later than 496 BCE. The Common Era (CE) comes after the Before
      Common Era (BCE), and even within the Common Era, 2008 is a recent year.

      - Lee Harvey Oswald was the assassin of US President John F. Kennedy. He was
      killed by Jack Ruby on November 24, 1963.

      - Piotr I likely refers to Peter I (Peter the Great), who was Tsar and later
      Emperor of Russia. He died on February 8, 1725.


      Now I need to compare these dates:

      - Lee Harvey Oswald died in 1963

      - Peter I (Piotr I) died in 1725


      Since 1963 comes after 1725 chronologically, Lee Harvey Oswald died at a later

      Lee Harvey Oswald was the assassin who killed U.S. President John F. Kennedy
      in 1963. Oswald himself was killed by Jack Ruby on November 24, 1963.


      Step 2: Identify who Piotr I was.

      Piotr I, also known as Peter the Great, was the Tsar of Russia from 1682 to
      1725. He died on February 8, 1725.

      - Lee Harvey Oswald died on November 24, 1963

      - Piotr I (Peter the Great) died on February 8, 1725


      Step 4: Determine which date is later.

      1963 comes after 1725 chronologically, so Oswald died at a later date than Piotr
      I.
