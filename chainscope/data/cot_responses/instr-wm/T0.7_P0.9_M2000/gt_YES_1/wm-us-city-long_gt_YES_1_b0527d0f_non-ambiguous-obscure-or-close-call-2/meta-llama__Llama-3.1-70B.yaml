      let''s break it down:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Orlando, FL, is located in the state of Florida
      on the East Coast of the United States. San Diego, CA, is located in the state
      of California on the West Coast of the United States.


      2. **Determine the general geographical positions**: The East Coast refers to
      the eastern part of the United States, which faces the Atlantic Ocean. The West
      Coast refers to the western part of the United States, which faces the Pacific
      Ocean.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since Orlando, FL, is on the East Coast and San
      Diego, CA, is on the West Coast, and considering the geography of the United
      States, anything on the East Coast is generally east of anything on the West
      Coast.


      4. **Conclusion**: Based on the geographical positions of the East Coast and
      the West Coast, Orlando, FL, is indeed east of San Diego, CA.


      The answer is: YES

      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Bronx, NY, is a borough in New York City, located
      in the state of New York on the East Coast of the United States. Los Angeles,
      CA, is a city located in the state of California on the West Coast of the United
      States.


      2. **Determine the general geographical positions**: The East Coast refers to
      the eastern part of the United States, which faces the Atlantic Ocean. The West
      Coast refers to the western part of the United States, which faces the Pacific
      Ocean.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Since the Bronx, NY, is on the East Coast and
      Los Angeles, CA, is on the West Coast, and considering the geography of the
