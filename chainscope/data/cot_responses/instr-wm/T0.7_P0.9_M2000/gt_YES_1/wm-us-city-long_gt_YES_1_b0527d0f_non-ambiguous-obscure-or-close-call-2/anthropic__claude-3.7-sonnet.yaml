      Step 1: Let me identify the geographical positions of both cities.

      - Orlando, FL is located in the southeastern United States.

      - San Diego, CA is located in the southwestern United States.


      Step 2: Consider their positions relative to each other on a map.

      - Florida is on the east coast of the United States.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Cities further east have higher longitude values (moving from west to east).

      - Orlando is much closer to the Atlantic Ocean (east coast).

      - San Diego is on the Pacific Ocean (west coast).


      Step 4: Make the final determination.

      - Since the United States spans from west to east with California on the western
      side and Florida on the eastern side, Orlando must be east of San Diego.


      YES, Orlando, FL is located east of San Diego, CA.'

      California.


      Step 2: Consider their positions relative to each other on a map of the United
      States.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Florida is on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their longitudinal positions.

      - Cities that are "east" of others have a more easterly longitude.

      - Since Florida is on the east coast and California is on the west coast, Orlando
      is east of San Diego.

      - Detroit is located in Michigan, in the Midwest/Great Lakes region of the United
      States.

      - Seattle is located in Washington state, on the west coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider their positions in terms of longitude (east-west positioning).

      - The United States spans from west to east, with the west coast (including
      Washington state) being on the Pacific Ocean.

      - The Midwest region (including Michigan) is much further inland and closer
      to the eastern portion of the country.


      Step 3: Make the comparison.

      - Seattle is on the west coast, which is the westernmost part of the contiguous
      United States.

      - Detroit is in the eastern half of the United States, much closer to the Atlantic
      coast than Seattle is.

      - Therefore, Detroit is located east of Seattle.


      YES, Detroit, MI is located east of Seattle, WA.'

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both cities.

      - Denver is the capital city of Colorado (CO), located in the Rocky Mountain
      region of the United States.

      - Compton is a city in California (CA), located in the Los Angeles metropolitan
      area.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on the US map.

      - California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - Colorado is in the interior of the country, east of California.


      Step 3: More specifically, Compton, CA is in southern California near the Pacific
      coast, while Denver, CO is in central Colorado.


      Step 4: In terms of east-west positioning, any city in Colorado will be east
      of any city in California, because Colorado is entirely east of California.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES, Denver, CO is located east of Compton, CA.'

      - Denver, Colorado is located in the Rocky Mountain region, roughly in the middle
      of the United States.

      - Compton, California is located in the Los Angeles metropolitan area in southern
      California, which is on the west coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider their positions in terms of longitude (east-west positioning).

      - States on the west coast (like California) are generally farther west than
      inland states.

      - Colorado is east of California in the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their specific locations.

      - Denver is in the eastern part of Colorado.

      - Compton is near the Pacific coast in California.

      - All of Colorado, including Denver, is east of all of California, including
      Compton.
