      let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Austin, TX (Texas) and Portland, OR (Oregon)
      are the two cities in question.

      2. **Understand the geography of the United States**: The United States is divided
      into various regions, with the general divisions including the East Coast, the
      West Coast, the South, the Midwest, and others. Texas is considered part of
      the South or Southwest, while Oregon is on the West Coast.

      3. **Determine the general directional relationship**: The West Coast of the
      United States is generally west of the rest of the country, including the South
      and the East Coast. This means that any city on the West Coast (like Portland,
      OR) will typically be west of cities in other parts of the country, except for
      those also on the West Coast or further west.

      4. **Consider Austin, TX, and Portland, OR, specifically**: Austin, TX, is located
      in the southern part of the United States, which places it east of the West
      Coast. Portland, OR, is on the West Coast, near the Pacific Ocean.

      5. **Conclusion based on geographical location**: Since Austin, TX, is in the
      south and Portland, OR, is on the West Coast, Austin is east of Portland in
      terms of geographical location within the United States.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Boston is in the state of Massachusetts, and
      Manhattan is in the state of New York.


      2. **Consider geographical directions**: East and west are the directions we''re
      concerned with. The United States is laid out in such a way that moving east
      means moving towards the Atlantic Ocean from the interior of the country.


      3. **Relative positions of Massachusetts and New York**: Massachusetts is generally
      east of New York. This is because if you start at the western edge of New York
      state and move east, you would eventually cross into Massachusetts.


      4. **Specific locations - Boston and Manhattan**: Boston is located on the eastern
      coast of Massachusetts, directly on the Atlantic Ocean. Manhattan, being part
      of New York City, is also on the Atlantic coast but is situated southwest of
      Boston.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that Boston is directly east of Manhattan when considering
      their geographical positions relative to each other (with Boston being northeast
      but more directly east than west in relation to Manhattan), the question of
      whether Boston is east of Manhattan can be answered affirmatively.

      1. **Identify the locations**: Queens, NY is a borough in New York City, located
      on the East Coast of the United States. Yosemite Valley, CA is a valley located
      in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California, on the West Coast of the United
      States.


      2. **Determine the general direction between the two locations**: Since Queens,
      NY is on the East Coast and Yosemite Valley, CA is on the West Coast, Queens
      is generally east of Yosemite Valley.


      3. **Consider if there''s any need for more precise geographical analysis**:
      Given the vast distance between the East and West Coasts and the fact that we''re
      comparing a location on one coast to a location on the other, the general east-west
      alignment of the coasts provides a clear enough indication for this comparison.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Queens, NY is located east of Yosemite
      Valley, CA is: **YES**.'

      NY is located east of Yosemite Valley, CA, let''s break down the process step
      by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Queens, NY is a borough in New York City, located
      in the state of New York on the East Coast of the United States. Yosemite Valley
      is a valley in Yosemite National Park, located in the state of California on
      the West Coast of the United States.


      2. **Determine the general geographical positions**: New York is on the East
      Coast, and California is on the West Coast. This means that New York (and thus
      Queens, NY) is generally east of California (and thus Yosemite Valley, CA).


      3. **Consider the specific geography**: Since Yosemite Valley, CA is on the
      West Coast and Queens, NY is on the East Coast, with the entire continental
      United States in between, Queens, NY is indeed east of Yosemite Valley, CA.


      Based on these steps, the answer to whether Queens, NY is located east of Yosemite
