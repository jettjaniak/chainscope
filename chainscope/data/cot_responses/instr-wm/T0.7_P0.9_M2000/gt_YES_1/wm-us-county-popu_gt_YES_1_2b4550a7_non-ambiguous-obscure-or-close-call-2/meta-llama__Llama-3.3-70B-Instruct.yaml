      let''s break it down into steps.


      1. **Identify the entities in question**: We are comparing King County, Washington
      (WA), with the District of Columbia (DC). Note that the District of Columbia
      is not a county but a federal district that serves as the capital of the United
      States. However, for the sake of comparison, we can consider its population
      as a single entity similar to a large county.

      County, CA.


      Step 1: Identify the population of Dallas County, TX. According to the 2020
      United States Census, the population of Dallas County, Texas, is approximately
      2,613,539.


      Step 2: Identify the population of Sacramento County, CA. According to the 2020
      United States Census, the population of Sacramento County, California, is approximately
      1,585,055.


      Step 3: Compare the populations of the two counties. Dallas County, TX, has
      a population of about 2,613,539, while Sacramento County, CA, has a population
      of about 1,585,055.


      Since 2,613,539 (Dallas County, TX) is greater than 1,585,055 (Sacramento County,
      CA), we can conclude that Dallas County, TX, is indeed more populous than Sacramento
      County, CA.
