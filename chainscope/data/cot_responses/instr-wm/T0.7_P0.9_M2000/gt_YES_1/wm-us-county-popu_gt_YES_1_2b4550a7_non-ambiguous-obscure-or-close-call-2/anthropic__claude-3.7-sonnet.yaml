      whether King County, WA is more populous than the District of Columbia, DC.


      Step 1: Let me recall the population of King County, Washington.

      King County is home to Seattle and is one of the most populous counties in Washington
      state. Its population is approximately 2.3 million people.


      Step 2: Let me recall the population of the District of Columbia (DC).

      DC is not a county but a federal district. Its population is approximately 700,000
      people.


      Step 3: Compare the two populations.

      King County, WA: ~2.3 million people

      District of Columbia, DC: ~700,000 people


      Since 2.3 million is greater than 700,000, King County has a larger population
      than DC.

      - King County, WA (which includes Seattle) has a population of approximately
      2.3 million people.

      - The District of Columbia (Washington, DC) has a population of approximately
      670,000 to 700,000 people.

      - King County''s population (2.3 million) is significantly larger than DC''s
      population (670,000-700,000).

      - King County has more than three times the population of DC.
