      1. First, Punjab is a region/province, located in India and Pakistan, while
      Pyongyang is a city (the capital of North Korea).


      2. Regions/provinces are typically much larger in area than individual cities.


      3. Punjab as a region spans approximately 50,361 square miles (when combining
      the Indian and Pakistani parts).


      4. Pyongyang city covers an area of about 1,633 square miles.

    caddd07a-1e6a-4ac9-9b74-b66fc19dc301: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s find the area of Dubai (Emirate):

      - Dubai Emirate covers approximately 4,114 square kilometers


      2. Next, let''s find the area of Bangalore:

      - Bangalore (also called Bengaluru) is a city in India

      - Its total area is around 741 square kilometers


      3. Comparing the two areas:

      - Dubai Emirate: 4,114 sq km

      - Bangalore: 741 sq km

      - 4,114 is larger than 741


      4. Therefore, the Emirate of Dubai has a LARGER area than Bangalore.
