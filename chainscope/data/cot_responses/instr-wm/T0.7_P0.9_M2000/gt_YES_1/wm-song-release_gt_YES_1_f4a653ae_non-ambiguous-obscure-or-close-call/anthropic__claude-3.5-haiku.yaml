      1. First, I''ll find the release date for Phil Collins''s "Sussudio":

      - "Sussudio" was released in 1985 as part of the album "No Jacket Required"


      2. Next, I''ll find the release date for Kanye West''s "Black Skinhead":

      - "Black Skinhead" was released in 2013 as part of the album "Yeezus"


      3. Compare the years:

      - "Sussudio" was released in 1985

      - "Black Skinhead" was released in 2013
