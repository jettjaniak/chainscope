      - "Sussudio" was released in 1985 as part of the album "No Jacket Required"


      2. Next, I''ll find the release date for Kanye West''s "Black Skinhead":

      - "Black Skinhead" was released in 2013 as part of the album "Yeezus"


      3. Compare the years:

      - "Sussudio" was released in 1985

      - "Black Skinhead" was released in 2013


      4. Determine the chronological order:

      - 2013 is later than 1985


      Therefore, the answer is: YES, Kanye West''s "Black Skinhead" was released later
      than Phil Collins''s "Sussudio".'
