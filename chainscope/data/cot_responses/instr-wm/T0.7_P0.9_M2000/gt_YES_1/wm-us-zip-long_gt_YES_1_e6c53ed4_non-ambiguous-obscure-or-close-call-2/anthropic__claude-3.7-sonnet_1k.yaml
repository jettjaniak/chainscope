      east of 90210, CA, I need to think about the relative locations of these zip
      codes.


      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 10011 is a zip code in New York (NY), specifically in Manhattan, New York
      City

      - 90210 is a zip code in California (CA), specifically in Beverly Hills, Los
      Angeles


      Now I need to think about their relative positions on the map of the United
      States:

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States

      - California is on the west coast of the United States


      Looking at a map of the United States, the east coast (where New York is located)
      is east of the west coast (where California is located). That means New York
      is east of California.


      Therefore, 10011, NY is located east of 90210, CA.</think>I need to determine
      the relative positions of these two zip codes on the US map.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 10011 is a zip code in New York (NY), specifically in Manhattan, New York
      City.

      - 90210 is a zip code in Beverly Hills, California (CA).


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of New York and California.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - The East Coast (where New York is) is east of the West Coast (where California
      is).

      - Therefore, any location in New York would be east of any location in California.


      YES, 10011, NY is located east of 90210, CA.'
    44e7b5b8-5abc-4f94-9972-1bfdf0c979e6: '<think>Let me break this down step by step:


      1) 10011 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      2) 90210 is a zip code in California (CA)


      To determine if one is east of the other, I need to consider their geographic
      locations on the US map.


      The United States spans from west to east, with:

      - California on the west coast

      - New York on the east coast


      California is on the Pacific Ocean side of the US, while New York is on the
      Atlantic Ocean side.


      Since the US mainland spans from west to east, locations in New York are east
      of locations in California. Therefore, zip code 10011 in NY would be east of
      zip code 90210 in CA.</think># Is 10011, NY located east of 90210, CA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes on the US
      map.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10011 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 90210 is a zip code in Beverly Hills, California (CA)


      Step 2: Determine their geographic positions.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States, bordering the
      Pacific Ocean

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States, bordering the
      Atlantic Ocean


      Step 3: Compare their positions on the east-west axis.

      - Moving from west to east across the continental United States, you would encounter
      California first, then New York

      - Therefore, New York is east of California


      Since 10011, NY is in New York, and 90210, CA is in California, the zip code
      in New York is east of the zip code in California.


      YES'

      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states within the US.

      - Florida is located on the southeastern coast of the United States

      - Nevada is located in the western part of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - Florida is on the east coast of the US

      - Nevada is far to the west of Florida, closer to the west coast


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      Since Florida is on the east coast and Nevada is in the western US, any location
      in Florida (including 33139) would be east of any location in Nevada (including
      89109).

      Step 2: Compare their relative positions.

      - The continental United States spans from east to west, with the Atlantic Ocean
      on the east and the Pacific Ocean on the west.

      - Florida borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast.

      - Nevada is a western state, located several states away from the Atlantic Ocean.


      Step 3: Consider longitude (east-west position).

      - States on the east coast (like Florida) have more eastern longitudes than
      states in the west (like Nevada).

      - All of Florida is east of all of Nevada on a map of the United States.

      First, let me identify these locations:

      - 10024 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 70112 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)


      In the United States, locations in the eastern states are generally east of
      locations in the more central or western states. New York is on the East Coast
      of the United States, while Louisiana is in the South/Gulf Coast region.


      Looking at a mental map of the United States, New York is definitely east of
      Louisiana. New York is one of the easternmost states, while Louisiana is considerably

      So geographically speaking, any location in New York would generally be east
      of any location in Louisiana.</think># Is 10024, NY located east of 70112, LA?


      I need to determine the geographical relationship between these two zip codes.


      ## Step-by-step reasoning:

      1) Zip code 10024 is in New York (NY), which is located on the East Coast of
      the United States

      2) Zip code 70112 is in Louisiana (LA), which is located in the southern part

      3) When looking at a map of the United States, New York is positioned significantly
      further east than Louisiana

      4) The entire state of New York is east of the entire state of Louisiana

      3. Compare their positions on an east-west axis


      For zip code 10024, NY:

      This is a zip code in New York (NY), specifically on the Upper West Side of
      Manhattan in New York City, which is on the eastern coast of the United States.


      For zip code 70112, LA:

      This is a zip code in Louisiana (LA), likely in or near New Orleans, which is
      in the southern part of the United States near the Gulf of Mexico.


      Geographically, the entire state of New York is east of Louisiana. The United
      States generally has lower numbered zip codes in the east and higher numbers
      as you move west, which aligns with these examples (10xxx for NY vs 70xxx for
      LA).

      - 70112 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA), likely in the New Orleans area.


      Step 2: Determine their relative east-west positions.

      - New York is located on the eastern coast of the United States.

      - Louisiana is located in the southern United States, bordering the Gulf of
      Mexico.

      - Geographically, New York is positioned far to the east of Louisiana.


      Step 3: Consider the general pattern of US zip codes.

      - US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers are assigned to
      the eastern parts of the country, while higher numbers are assigned to western
      regions.

      - The 10xxx series is used for New York City, while the 70xxx series is used
      for Louisiana.


      YES, 10024, NY is located east of 70112, LA.'

      First, let me identify these zip codes:

      - 11954 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 90028 is a zip code in California (CA)


      In the United States, locations in New York are generally east of locations
      in California. This is because California is on the west coast of the United
      States, while New York is on the east coast.


      The continental United States spans from west to east, with California being
      on the western edge and New York being closer to the eastern edge. So geographically,
      any location in New York would be east of any location in California.


      Therefore, 11954, NY would be located east of 90028, CA.</think>Let me solve
      this step by step:


      Step 1: I need to understand the geographic positions of these zip codes.

      - 11954 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 90028 is a zip code in California (CA)


      Step 2: Now I need to determine their relative positions east-west.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States


      Step 3: In terms of geography, locations in New York are always east of locations
      in California because the United States spans from west (Pacific Ocean) to east
      (Atlantic Ocean).


      Step 4: Therefore, regardless of the specific locations within these states,
      any zip code in New York will be east of any zip code in California.


      YES, 11954, NY is located east of 90028, CA.'
    731e723b-8a37-47a3-8cb4-71e7a5ac5d6e: '<think>Let me reason step by step about

      1) 11954 is a ZIP code in NY (New York)

      2) 90028 is a ZIP code in CA (California)


      To determine which is east of the other, I need to know their relative positions
      on the US map.


      New York is on the east coast of the United States, while California is on the
      west coast. The continental United States spans from west to east, with the
      west coast (including California) being on the Pacific Ocean side and the east
      coast (including New York) being on the Atlantic Ocean side.


      Given this geographic knowledge:

      - New York is east of California

      So 11954, NY would be east of 90028, CA.</think>I need to determine the relative
      geographic positions of these two ZIP codes.


      Step 1: Identify the states.

      - 11954 is in NY (New York)

      Step 2: Determine the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - When looking at a map of the United States, states on the East Coast (like
      New York) are east of states on the West Coast (like California)

      - This is true regardless of the specific ZIP codes within those states


      Step 4: Make the conclusion.

      - Since New York is east of California, any ZIP code in New York (including
      11954) must be east of any ZIP code in California (including 90028)


      YES'

      First, let me identify the locations:

      - 11954, NY: This is a ZIP code in New York state, which is on the east coast
      of the United States.

      - 90028, CA: This is a ZIP code in California, which is on the west coast of
      the United States.


      Geographically in the United States, New York is east of California. This is
      because:

      1. The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the
      Atlantic Ocean (east)

      2. California is on the Pacific coast (western edge)

      3. New York is on the Atlantic coast (eastern edge)


      So any location in New York state would be east of any location in California.</think>I

      - 90028 is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States


      Step 3: Apply basic U.S. geography knowledge.

      - When comparing east-west positions in the continental United States, locations
      on the east coast (like New York) are east of locations on the west coast (like
      California)


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Any ZIP code in New York would be east of any ZIP code in California, regardless
      of their specific locations within those states


      YES, 11954, NY is located east of 90028, CA.'

      In the United States, California is on the west coast, and New York is on the
      east coast. The continental United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west)
      to the Atlantic Ocean (east).


      Since California is on the west coast and New York is on the east coast, locations

      - In the United States, locations on the east coast are east of locations on
      the west coast

      - Moving from California to New York means traveling eastward


      Since New York (where 10003 is located) is on the east coast and California

      United States:

      - California is on the west coast of the United States

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States


      Since the continental United States spans from west (Pacific Ocean) to east
      (Atlantic Ocean), and California is on the western edge while New York is on
      the eastern edge, New York is east of California.


      Therefore, zip code 10007 in NY is located east of zip code 94133 in CA.</think>To
      determine if 10007, NY is located east of 94133, CA, I need to understand the

      - 10007 is a zip code in New York (NY), which is on the east coast of the United
      States.

      - 94133 is a zip code in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the continental United States.

      - The United States spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean
      (east).

      - California borders the Pacific Ocean on the west coast.

      - New York borders the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast.


      Step 3: Compare their positions.

      - Since New York is on the east coast and California is on the west coast, New
      York is east of California.

      - Therefore, any location in New York (including 10007) would be east of any
      location in California (including 94133).

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Moving from west to east across the United States, you would encounter California
      first, then New York.

      - Therefore, New York is east of California on a map.


      YES, 10023, NY is located east of 94301, CA.'

      ## Step-by-step reasoning:


      1) 11201 is a zip code in New York (NY), which is on the eastern coast of the
      United States.


      2) 90291 is a zip code in California (CA), which is on the western coast of

      east-west positions of two zip codes: 10013, NY and 70130, LA.


      First, let me identify the states:

      - 10013, NY: This is a zip code in New York

      - 70130, LA: This is a zip code in Louisiana


      To determine which is east of the other, I need to consider their geographical
      locations on the US map.


      New York is on the east coast of the United States, while Louisiana is in the
      southern part of the country, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.


      In terms of east-west positioning (longitude):

      - New York is much further east than Louisiana

      - Louisiana is much further west than New York


      Therefore, 10013, NY (New York) would be east of 70130, LA (Louisiana).</think>I''ll
      think about this step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10013 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 70130 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Louisiana is located in the southern part of the United States, much further
      west


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions on an east-west axis.

      - New York is positioned significantly east of Louisiana

      - Any zip code in New York would be east of any zip code in Louisiana


      Therefore, 10013, NY is indeed located east of 70130, LA.

      I need to think about the geographical locations of these zip codes:


      10013 is a zip code in New York (NY). New York is on the East Coast of the United
      States.

      70130 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA). Louisiana is in the southern United States,
      along the Gulf of Mexico.


      In the United States, locations that are more east have lower longitude values,
      and locations that are more west have higher longitude values.


      New York is definitely east of Louisiana on a map of the United States. New
      York is on the East Coast, while Louisiana is in the southern central part of
      the country.

      seaboard of the United States.


      2) Zip code 70130, LA refers to a location in Louisiana, which is in the southern
      part of the United States along the Gulf of Mexico.


      3) In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), New York is located much further
      east than Louisiana on the US map.


      4) The first digits of US zip codes generally follow a pattern where lower numbers
      (1xx) are assigned to eastern regions and higher numbers (7xx) are assigned
      to more central/southern regions.


      5) The zip code 10013 (starting with "1") confirms it''s in the eastern region,
      while 70130 (starting with "7") confirms it''s further west.
