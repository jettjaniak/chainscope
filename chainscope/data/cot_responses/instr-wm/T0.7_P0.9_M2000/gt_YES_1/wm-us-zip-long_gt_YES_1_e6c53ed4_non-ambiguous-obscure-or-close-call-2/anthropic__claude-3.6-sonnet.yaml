    fb1dd886-7435-4c38-af37-70cc525dc121: 'Let me solve this step by step:


      1) 10012 is a ZIP code in New York City (Manhattan)

      2) 94043 is a ZIP code in Mountain View, California


      3) When comparing east/west positions in the US:

      - California is on the west coast

      - New York is on the east coast


      4) Therefore, any point in New York will be east of any point in California


      5) Since 10012 (NY) is on the east coast and 94043 (CA) is on the west coast,
      10012 must be east of 94043.
