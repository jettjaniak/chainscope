      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10011 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 90210 is a zip code in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states in the US.

      - New York is on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is on the West Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - The United States spans from west to east, with the West Coast (including
      California) being the westernmost part and the East Coast (including New York)
      being the easternmost part.

      - Therefore, any location in New York would be east of any location in California.


      Step 4: Conclude about the specific zip codes.

      - Since 10011, NY is in New York, and 90210, CA is in California, the New York
      zip code must be east of the California zip code.


      YES, 10011, NY is located east of 90210, CA.'

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 11954 is in New York (NY)

      - 90028 is in California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of New York and California within
      the United States.

      - New York is on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is on the West Coast of the United States


      Step 3: In terms of cardinal directions in the US:

      - East Coast states like New York are east of West Coast states like California

      - This is a fundamental geographic fact about the United States


      Step 4: Therefore, any location in New York state (including zip code 11954)
      would be east of any location in California (including zip code 90028).


      NO WAIT - I need to be more precise. The question asks specifically about these
      zip codes, not just the states.


      Step 5: Looking at the specific locations:

      - 11954 is in Mattituck, NY, on the eastern part of Long Island

      - 90028 is in Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA, on the western coast


      This confirms that 11954, NY is indeed east of 90028, CA.

      east of California

      - The East Coast is east of the West Coast


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      - Since 10003 (NY) is on the East Coast and 90069 (CA) is on the West Coast,
      10003 is located east of 90069

      - Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative east-west positions.

      - New York is significantly east of Minnesota on the US map

      - Any location in New York (including Long Island where Water Mill is located)

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 11201 is in Brooklyn, New York (NY)

      - 90291 is in Venice, California (CA)


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these locations within the United
      States.

      - New York is on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is on the West Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Moving from west to east across the United States, we go from California to
      New York

      - Therefore, New York (including Brooklyn) is east of California (including
      Venice)


      Step 4: Reach a conclusion about the specific zip codes.

      - Since 11201 (Brooklyn, NY) is in New York, and 90291 (Venice, CA) is in California,
      and New York is east of California, it follows that 11201 is east of 90291.

      City.

      - 70130 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA), specifically in New Orleans.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these locations in the United States.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Louisiana is located in the southern part of the United States, along the
      Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - New York is significantly farther east than Louisiana on the US map.

      - New York is approximately around 74-75 degrees west longitude.

      - New Orleans, Louisiana is approximately around 90 degrees west longitude.

      - A smaller longitude number (when both are west) indicates a more eastern position.


      Step 4: Make the determination based on longitude.

      - Since New York has a smaller west longitude than Louisiana, New York is east
      of Louisiana.

      - Therefore, zip code 10013 (NY) is east of zip code 70130 (LA).
