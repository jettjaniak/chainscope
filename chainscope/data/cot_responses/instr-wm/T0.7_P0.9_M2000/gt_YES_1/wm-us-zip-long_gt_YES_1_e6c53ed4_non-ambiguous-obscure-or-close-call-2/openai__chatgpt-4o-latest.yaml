      New York is located east of ZIP code 70116 in Louisiana, we need to consider
      their geographical locations in terms of longitude.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes.

      - ZIP code 10014 is in New York, specifically in the Manhattan area.

      - ZIP code 70116 is in New Orleans, Louisiana.


      Step 2: Understand U.S. geography.

      - New York is located in the northeastern United States.

      - Louisiana is located in the southeastern region of the United States, along
      the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 3: Consider longitudinal positions.

      - Longitude measures east-west position on the globe. The more negative the
      longitude (in the Western Hemisphere), the farther west the location.

      - New York (10014) has a longitude of approximately -74.00.

      - New Orleans (70116) has a longitude of approximately -90.06.


      Step 4: Compare the longitudes.

      - -74.00 (New York) is east of -90.06 (New Orleans), because -74 is closer to
      zero and therefore farther east.


      Final Step: Based on the comparison, ZIP code 10014 (New York) is indeed east
      of ZIP code 70116 (New Orleans).

      is located east of ZIP code 70112 in Louisiana, we need to:


      **Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes.**


      - ZIP code **10024** is in **New York, NY**, specifically in the Upper West
      Side of Manhattan.

      - ZIP code **70112** is in **New Orleans, LA**, covering part of the downtown
      area.


      **Step 2: Understand their longitudinal coordinates.**


      - New York, NY (ZIP 10024) is located at approximately **longitude -73.97**.

      - New Orleans, LA (ZIP 70112) is located at approximately **longitude -90.08**.


      **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**


      - In geographic coordinates, more negative longitudes in the Western Hemisphere
      indicate locations further **west**.

      - Since **-73.97 is greater than -90.08**, New York is located **east** of New

      - ZIP code 10036 is in New York, specifically in the borough of Manhattan.

      - This ZIP code covers parts of Midtown Manhattan, including the Theater District
      and Times Square.

      - New York City is located on the eastern coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Identify the location of ZIP code 90265.

      - ZIP code 90265 is in California, specifically in the city of Malibu.

      - Malibu is located along the Pacific Coast, in Southern California.

      - California is located on the western coast of the United States.

      is located east of ZIP code 94043, CA, we need to analyze their geographic locations.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes.


      - ZIP code 10012 is in New York, NY. Specifically, it covers parts of lower
      Manhattan, including SoHo and Greenwich Village.

      - ZIP code 94043 is in Mountain View, California, which is in the San Francisco
      Bay Area.


      Step 2: Determine the relative geographic positions.


      - New York is on the East Coast of the United States.

      - California is on the West Coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudes.


      - New York (10012) has a longitude of approximately -74 degrees (West).

      - Mountain View, CA (94043) has a longitude of approximately -122 degrees (West).


      Since -74 is east of -122 (closer to 0), New York is geographically east of
