      east of 90210, CA, I need to identify the geographical locations of these zip
      codes and compare their positions on the east-west axis.


      10011 is a zip code in New York City, specifically in Manhattan.

      90210 is a famous zip code in Beverly Hills, California.


      In the United States, locations are generally measured by longitude for east-west
      positioning. Lower longitude numbers represent more western locations, while
      higher longitude numbers represent more eastern locations.


      However, I don''t need to know the exact longitude coordinates to answer this
      question. I can use general geographic knowledge:


      1. New York is on the East Coast of the United States.

      2. California is on the West Coast of the United States.

      3. The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the
      Pacific Ocean (west).

      4. States on the East Coast (like New York) are east of states on the West Coast
      (like California).


      Therefore, any location in New York, including zip code 10011, would be east
      of any location in California, including zip code 90210.


      So, 10011, NY is located east of 90210, CA.</think>To determine if 10011, NY
      is located east of 90210, CA, I''ll think about the geographic locations of
      these zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10011 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York City, New York

      - 90210 is a zip code in Beverly Hills, California


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of New York and California within the
      United States.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the
      Pacific Ocean (west)

      - New York faces the Atlantic Ocean on the east

      - California faces the Pacific Ocean on the west

      - Therefore, any location in New York is east of any location in California

      locations of two US ZIP codes: 10011, NY and 90210, CA.


      Let me break this down:

      1. 10011 is a ZIP code in New York (NY)

      2. 90210 is a ZIP code in California (CA)

      3. I need to determine if 10011, NY is located east of 90210, CA


      To figure this out, I need to recall the general geography of the United States:

      - The US spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast to the Pacific Ocean
      on the west coast

      - New York is on the east coast of the US

      - California is on the west coast of the US


      Since New York is on the east coast and California is on the west coast, any
      location in New York would be east of any location in California.


      Therefore, 10011, NY (which is in New York) is located east of 90210, CA (which
      is in California).


      The answer is YES.</think># Is 10011, NY located east of 90210, CA?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two ZIP codes on the US

      zip code 10011, NY is located east of the zip code 90210, CA.


      First, let me identify the locations associated with these zip codes:

      - 10011 is a zip code in New York, likely in New York City.

      - 90210 is a well-known zip code for Beverly Hills, California.


      Now, to determine which is further east, I need to consider their relative positions
      on the map of the United States:


      The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast to the Pacific
      Ocean on the west coast. New York is on the east coast, while California is
      on the west coast. This means that generally, locations in New York are east
      of locations in California.


      Specifically:

      - New York (including NYC where 10011 is located) is one of the easternmost
      states in the continental US.

      - California (including Beverly Hills where 90210 is located) is the westernmost
      state in the continental US.


      Therefore, 10011, NY is definitely located east of 90210, CA.

      City.

      - 90210 is a zip code in California (CA), specifically in Beverly Hills, Los
      Angeles.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic orientation of the United States.

      - The US spans from the Pacific Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean (east).

      - California is on the west coast of the United States.

      - New York is on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions.

      - Since New York is on the east coast and California is on the west coast, any

      \ the locations\n- 10014, NY is a zip code in New York City, specifically in\
      \ the Greenwich Village area of Manhattan.\n- 70116, LA is a zip code in New\

      \ York) is on the eastern side of the country\n- Louisiana is in the southern\
      \ part of the US, considerably west of New York\n\n## Step 3: Consider longitude\
      \ (east-west position)\n- New York City is approximately at longitude -74\xB0\
      \ W\n- New Orleans is approximately at longitude -90\xB0 W\n- Less negative\

      east of 89109, NV, I need to:


      1. Identify the locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine their relative positions (east/west)


      Let me start by identifying these zip codes:


      33139, FL: This is a zip code in Florida. Florida is on the east coast of the
      United States.


      89109, NV: This is a zip code in Nevada. Nevada is in the western part of the
      United States.


      The United States generally runs with lower longitudes in the east and higher
      longitudes in the west (in terms of absolute values, eastern US has smaller
      negative longitudes than western US).


      Geographically speaking, Florida is located in the southeastern United States,
      while Nevada is located in the western United States. Looking at a mental map
      of the US:


      - Florida is on the east coast bordering the Atlantic Ocean

      - Nevada is in the west, east of California and west of Utah


      Since Florida is on the east coast and Nevada is in the western part of the
      country, 33139, FL would be east of 89109, NV.


      To be even more specific:

      - 33139 appears to be in Miami Beach, Florida

      - 89109 appears to be in Las Vegas, Nevada


      Miami Beach is definitely east of Las Vegas, so 33139, FL is east of 89109,
      NV.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west
      positioning of these two zip codes.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 33139 is a zip code in Florida (FL)

      - 89109 is a zip code in Nevada (NV)

      - Florida is located on the southeastern coast of the United States, bordering
      the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Nevada is located in the western United States, far inland from the east coast.


      Step 3: Compare the longitudinal positions.

      - All of Florida is east of all of Nevada on the US map.

      - More specifically, 33139 is in Miami Beach, Florida, while 89109 is in Las
      Vegas, Nevada.

      - Miami Beach is significantly east of Las Vegas.


      Therefore, 33139, FL is indeed located east of 89109, NV.

      whether ZIP code 33139 in Florida is located east of ZIP code 89109 in Nevada.


      To solve this, I need to:

      1. Determine the geographic locations of these two ZIP codes

      2. Compare their positions in terms of east/west orientation

      3. Decide if 33139, FL is east of 89109, NV


      Let''s think about this:


      1. ZIP code 33139 is in Florida (FL). Florida is located on the east coast of
      the United States.

      2. ZIP code 89109 is in Nevada (NV). Nevada is located in the western part of
      the United States.


      Geographically, the United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east
      to the Pacific Ocean on the west. States on the east coast (like Florida) are
      always east of inland western states (like Nevada).


      Since Florida is on the east coast and Nevada is in the western part of the
      country, any location in Florida would be east of any location in Nevada.


      Therefore, ZIP code 33139 in Florida is indeed east of ZIP code 89109 in Nevada.


      The answer is YES.</think>I need to determine if ZIP code 33139 in Florida is

      the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Nevada (NV) is located in the western part of the United States, between California
      and Utah.

      other.

      - The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west).

      - Florida is one of the easternmost states in the country.

      - Nevada is significantly west of Florida.


      Step 3: Apply this knowledge to the specific ZIP codes.

      - ZIP code 33139 is in Florida, specifically in Miami Beach.

      - ZIP code 89109 is in Nevada, specifically in Las Vegas.

      - Since all of Florida is east of all of Nevada, any ZIP code in Florida (including

      zip code 10024 in New York is located east of the zip code 70112 in Louisiana.
      Let me break this down step by step:


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10024 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 70112 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)


      Step 2: Recall the general geographic positions of New York and Louisiana within
      the United States.

      - New York is located in the northeastern part of the United States.

      - Louisiana is located in the southeastern part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - In terms of longitude (east-west position), New York is generally east of
      Louisiana.

      - New York is on the Atlantic coast, while Louisiana is on the Gulf of Mexico.

      - The eastern states (like New York) have lower longitude numbers than western
      states because longitude in the US is measured in degrees west of the Prime
      Meridian.


      Step 4: Verify more specifically the locations of these zip codes.

      - 10024 is likely in New York City or the surrounding area, which is definitely
      on the eastern seaboard.

      - 70112 appears to be in or near New Orleans, Louisiana, which is on the Gulf
      Coast.


      Based on the general geography of the United States, New York is definitely
      east of Louisiana. Therefore, zip code 10024 in NY is east of zip code 70112
      in LA.


      The answer is YES.


      Wait, let me double-check this by looking at actual locations:


      - Zip code 10024 is on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City, NY.

      - Zip code 70112 is in New Orleans, LA.


      Looking at a map of the United States, New York City is clearly east of New

      Step-by-Step Reasoning


      First, I need to identify what these zip codes represent:

      - 10024 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 70112 is a zip code in Louisiana (LA)


      Next, I need to determine their relative positions on a west-east axis:

      1. New York is located on the Atlantic coast in the northeastern United States

      2. Louisiana is located along the Gulf of Mexico in the southeastern United
      States

      3. On a map of the United States, New York is positioned to the east of Louisiana


      More specifically:

      - Zip code 10024 is in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City

      - Zip code 70112 is in New Orleans, Louisiana


      Looking at the geography of the continental United States, the entire state
      of New York is east of the entire state of Louisiana.

      11954, NY is located east of 90028, CA. I''ll break this down step by step.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      11954 is a zip code in New York (NY).

      90028 is a zip code in California (CA).


      Step 2: Consider the geography of the United States.

      The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast to the Pacific
      Ocean on the west coast. New York is on the east coast, while California is
      on the west coast. Generally speaking, locations in New York are east of locations
      in California because of this basic geographic layout of the country.


      Step 3: More specifically, I can think about the longitudinal positions of these
      states.

      New York is roughly around 74-77 degrees West longitude.

      California is roughly around 114-124 degrees West longitude.


      Since lower values of West longitude indicate being more east (closer to 0 degrees,
      which would be at the Prime Meridian), New York is east of California.


      Step 4: Even more specifically, I can look at the potential locations of these
      specific zip codes.

      11954 in NY is likely in a typical New York location, east of most of the country.

      90028 in CA is likely in a typical California location, west of most of the
      country.


      Given the general geography of the United States, with New York on the east
      coast and California on the west coast, it is safe to conclude that 11954, NY
      is located east of 90028, CA.


      So, my answer is YES.</think># Is 11954, NY located east of 90028, CA?


      I''ll think through this step by step:


      1) First, I need to consider the geographical positions of New York (NY) and
      California (CA) within the United States.


      2) The United States is laid out with the Atlantic Ocean on the east and the
      Pacific Ocean on the west.


      3) New York state is located on the east coast of the United States, bordering
      the Atlantic Ocean.


      4) California is located on the west coast of the United States, bordering the
      Pacific Ocean.


      5) In terms of geography, all locations in New York state are east of all locations
      in California.


      6) Therefore, zip code 11954 in NY must be east of zip code 90028 in CA.

      For 11954, NY:

      This is a zip code in New York state. New York is on the east coast of the United

      For 90028, CA:

      This is a zip code in California. California is on the west coast of the United

      New York on its east coast.


      But let''s be more precise. On a west-east axis in the United States:

      - West Coast (including California) is on the far west

      First, I need to identify where these zip codes are located.

      - 10003 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      - 90069 is a zip code in California (CA)


      Now, to determine which one is east of the other, I need to remember the relative
      positions of New York and California within the United States.


      The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west). New York is on the East Coast of the United States, while California
      is on the West Coast.


      So geographically:

      - New York (NY) is in the eastern part of the United States

      - California (CA) is in the western part of the United States


      Since New York is east of California, it follows that zip code 10003 in NY is
      east of zip code 90069 in CA.


      So the answer is YES, 10003, NY is located east of 90069, CA.</think># Determining

      location in New York (including zip code 10003) would be east of any location
      in California (including zip code 90069).


      YES, 10003, NY is located east of 90069, CA.'

      - 90069, CA: This is a ZIP code in California


      The United States is generally oriented such that the East Coast (including
      New York) is east of the West Coast (including California). This is a fundamental
      geographic fact about the continental United States.


      New York is on the East Coast of the United States, while California is on the

      So, ZIP code 10003 in New York is located east of ZIP code 90069 in California.


      Therefore, the answer is YES.


      Actually, let me double-check my reasoning. The question is asking if 10003,
      NY is east of 90069, CA. East means toward the Atlantic Ocean from the continental
      United States, and west means toward the Pacific Ocean. New York is closer to
      the Atlantic, and California is closer to the Pacific. So New York is east of

      - 90069 is a ZIP code in California (CA)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic orientation of the United States

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States


      ## Step 3: Apply east-west directionality

      - In geographic terms, "east" refers to locations closer to the Atlantic Ocean

      - "West" refers to locations closer to the Pacific Ocean

      - The entire state of New York is east of the entire state of California

      relative geographic positions of two zip codes: 10003, NY and 90069, CA.


      To determine if 10003, NY is east of 90069, CA, I need to understand where these
      zip codes are located.


      10003 is a zip code in New York (NY). Specifically, it is in Manhattan, New
      York City, which is on the East Coast of the United States.


      90069 is a zip code in California (CA). It appears to be in the Los Angeles
      area (West Hollywood), which is on the West Coast of the United States.


      The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the
      Pacific Ocean on the west. The East Coast (where New York is) is east of the
      West Coast (where California is).


      So, 10003, NY (on the East Coast) is east of 90069, CA (on the West Coast).


      Therefore, the answer is YES.</think># Reasoning Step by Step


      To determine if 10003, NY is east of 90069, CA, I need to identify where these
      zip codes are located and compare their positions on the map of the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 10003 is a zip code in New York (NY), specifically in the Manhattan area of
      New York City

      - 90069 is a zip code in California (CA), specifically in the West Hollywood/Los
      Angeles area


      Step 2: Consider the geographic layout of the United States

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States

      - The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the
      Pacific Ocean (west)


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions

      - All of New York state, including Manhattan (10003), is located east of all
      of California, including Los Angeles (90069)

      - Moving from California to New York requires traveling eastward


      Therefore, YES, 10003, NY is located east of 90069, CA.'

      Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,
      North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. The states along the west
      coast include Washington, Oregon, and California.


      New York (NY) is on the east coast of the United States, while California (CA)
      is on the west coast. In terms of longitude, all locations in New York state
      are east of all locations in California.


      Since 10019 is a ZIP code in New York (NY), and 94027 is a ZIP code in California
      (CA), we can conclude that 10019, NY is located east of 94027, CA.


      So the answer is YES, 10019, NY is located east of 94027, CA.


      Let me double-check this:


      In the US, ZIP codes don''t directly encode longitude information, but the general
      structure of ZIP codes does roughly follow geography. ZIP codes on the east
      coast generally start with lower numbers (0, 1, 2), while those on the west
      coast have higher first digits (9 for California, Oregon, Washington, etc.).


      10019 is a ZIP code that starts with 1, which corresponds to the New York City
      area.

      94027 is a ZIP code that starts with 9, which corresponds to California.


      This confirms our reasoning based on the states. New York is east of California,
      so any location in New York (including 10019) is east of any location in California
      (including 94027).


      The answer is YES.</think># Is 10019, NY located east of 94027, CA?


      To answer this question, I need to determine the relative geographic positions
      of these two ZIP codes based on their locations in the United States.


      ## Step-by-Step Reasoning:


      1) 10019 is a ZIP code in New York (NY), which is located on the East Coast
      of the United States.


      2) 94027 is a ZIP code in California (CA), which is located on the West Coast
      of the United States.


      3) In terms of U.S. geography, the East Coast (including all of New York) is
      east of the West Coast (including all of California).


      4) The continental United States spans from east to west, with lower longitude
      values (more eastern locations) on the East Coast and higher longitude values
      (more western locations) on the West Coast.


      5) Since 10019 is in New York on the East Coast, and 94027 is in California
      on the West Coast, the NY location must be east of the CA location.

    ee079ba4-2905-4104-900d-01b21ae2fd4b: '<think>Let me think about this step by
      step.


      The question is asking if 10019, NY is located east of 94027, CA.


      First, I need to identify these locations.

      - 10019 is a ZIP code in New York (NY). Specifically, it''s in Manhattan, New
      York City.

      - 94027 is a ZIP code in California (CA). I believe this is in the San Francisco
      Bay Area, specifically Atherton.


      Now, I need to determine their relative positions on the east-west axis.


      The United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific Ocean
      on the west. New York is on the east coast, while California is on the west
      coast. Therefore, in general, locations in New York are east of locations in
      California.


      So, 10019, NY (Manhattan) is located east of 94027, CA (Atherton).


      The answer is YES.</think>I need to determine if ZIP code 10019 in New York
      is east of ZIP code 94027 in California.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10019 is a ZIP code in New York (NY), specifically in Midtown Manhattan, New
      York City.

      - 94027 is a ZIP code in California (CA), specifically in Atherton, near San
      Francisco.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of these states.

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Determine their relative positions.

      The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west). New York State is positioned along the Atlantic Ocean, while California
      is positioned along the Pacific Ocean.


      Step 4: Make the comparison.

      Since New York is on the East Coast and California is on the West Coast, any
      location in New York (including 10019) is east of any location in California
      (including 94027).


      YES'

      \n1) First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's asking if\
      \ the location with zip code 10019 in New York (NY) is east of the location\
      \ with zip code 94027 in California (CA).\n\n2) In the United States, locations\
      \ on the east coast (like New York) are generally east of locations on the west\
      \ coast (like California). This is because the continental US spans from the\
      \ Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean (west), with California being on\
      \ the Pacific coast and New York being on the Atlantic coast.\n\n3) So just\
      \ based on the states, we would expect a location in NY to be east of a location\
      \ in CA.\n\n4) Let's confirm this by thinking about the geographic layout of\
      \ the US. California is on the west coast, while New York is on the east coast.\
      \ Moving from west to east across the continental US, you would go from California\
      \ to states like Nevada, Utah, Colorado, etc., and eventually reach states on\
      \ the east coast like New York.\n\n5) The specific zip codes 10019 (NY) and\
      \ 94027 (CA) don't change this general east-west relationship. Zip code 10019\
      \ is in New York City, specifically in the borough of Manhattan, which is indeed\
      \ on the east coast of the US. Zip code 94027 is for Atherton, California, which\
      \ is near San Francisco on the west coast.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that yes,\
      \ 10019, NY is located east of 94027, CA.\n\nActually, I should be more careful.\
      \ Let me think about this in terms of longitude. East-west position is measured\

      \ York City is roughly at longitude 74 degrees west (or -74 degrees).\nSan Francisco\
      \ (near Atherton, CA) is roughly at longitude 122 degrees west (or -122 degrees).\n\
      \nSince -74 > -122, New York is east of California.\n\nSo again, my conclusion\

      Let me break this down:

      1. 10007, NY is a zip code in New York

      2. 94133, CA is a zip code in California


      Generally speaking, New York is on the east coast of the United States, while
      California is on the west coast. In terms of cardinal directions, locations
      in New York are typically east of locations in California.


      To be more precise:

      - 10007 is a zip code in Lower Manhattan, New York City, New York, which is
      located on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      - 94133 is a zip code in San Francisco, California, which is located on the
      western seaboard of the United States.


      Since the United States spans from west to east with California on the west
      coast and New York on the east coast, any location in New York would be east
      of any location in California.

      Next, I need to consider the geographic positioning of these locations within
      the United States:

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States


      Looking at a map of the United States, we can see that the country spans from
      west (Pacific Ocean side) to east (Atlantic Ocean side). California is on the
      western edge, while New York is on the eastern edge.

      along the Pacific Ocean. Going from west to east across the continental US:

      - The West Coast states include California (CA)

      - The East Coast states include New York (NY)


      California is on the west coast of the United States, while New York is on the
      east coast. Therefore, any location in New York would be east of any location
      in California.


      So, 10007, NY (a zip code in New York) is located east of 94133, CA (a zip code
      in California).


      The answer is YES, 10007, NY is located east of 94133, CA.</think># Step-by-Step
      Reasoning


      First, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes:

      - 10007, NY is a zip code in New York State

      - 94133, CA is a zip code in California


      Next, I need to consider the geographical positions of these states within the
      United States:

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States, bordering the
      Pacific Ocean

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States, bordering the
      Atlantic Ocean


      In terms of longitude (east-west positioning), the entire state of New York
      lies east of the entire state of California. The continental United States spans
      from west to east, with California on the western side and New York on the eastern
      side.


      Therefore, any location in New York (including zip code 10007) must be east
      of any location in California (including zip code 94133).

      if a US zip code 10007 in New York (NY) is located east of zip code 94133 in
      California (CA).


      To answer this, I need to:

      1. Identify the approximate geographical locations of these zip codes

      2. Determine which one is further east


      First, I know that in the US, zip codes 10xxx are generally in the New York
      City area, while zip codes 9xxxx are generally in western states like California.


      More specifically:

      - 10007 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York City, NY, which is on the East
      Coast of the United States

      - 94133 is a zip code in San Francisco, CA, which is on the West Coast of the
      United States


      In terms of geography, the United States spans from west to east, with:

      - California on the West Coast

      - New York on the East Coast


      Since New York is on the East Coast and California is on the West Coast, New
      York is east of California. Therefore, zip code 10007 in NY is located east
      of zip code 94133 in CA.


      So the answer is YES, 10007, NY is located east of 94133, CA.</think># Is 10007,

      I need to determine the geographical locations of these zip codes and compare
      their positions from east to west.


      ## Step 1: Identify the locations

      - 10007 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York City, NY

      - 94133 is a zip code in San Francisco, CA


      ## Step 2: Consider their positions in the US

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is located on the West Coast of the United States


      ## Step 3: Compare east-west positions

      In the United States, the East Coast (including New York) is east of the West
      Coast (including California).


      Therefore, 10007, NY is located east of 94133, CA.

      whether 10023, NY is located east of 94301, CA. I need to figure out where these
      zip codes are located geographically and then determine their relative east-west
      positioning.


      Let me think about this:


      1. 10023 is a zip code in New York (NY). New York is on the east coast of the
      United States.

      2. 94301 is a zip code in California (CA). California is on the west coast of
      the United States.


      In the United States, the east coast (including New York) is east of the west
      coast (including California). So generally, locations in New York are east of
      locations in California.


      To be more specific:

      - 10023 is a zip code in Manhattan, New York City, New York.

      - 94301 is a zip code in Palo Alto, California.


      The continental United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the
      Pacific Ocean on the west. New York is near the Atlantic Ocean (east), while
      California is near the Pacific Ocean (west).


      So, 10023, NY (Manhattan) is indeed located east of 94301, CA (Palo Alto).


      The answer is YES.</think>I need to determine the relative east-west positioning

      States.

      - 94301 is a zip code in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic layout of the United States.

      The continental US spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific Ocean
      (west). New York faces the Atlantic Ocean, while California faces the Pacific
      Ocean.


      Step 3: Compare the specific locations.

      - 10023 is in Manhattan, New York City

      - 94301 is in Palo Alto, California


      Since the United States has New York on the east coast and California on the

      the relative east-west positioning of two zip codes in the United States.


      Let me break this down:

      1. 11976, NY - This is a zip code in New York state

      2. 55425, MN - This is a zip code in Minnesota state


      To determine which is more eastern, I need to compare their geographic positions.
      The United States generally has states in the east with lower longitude values
      (since longitude increases as you move west from the Prime Meridian).


      Let''s think about the general geographic positions:

      - New York (NY) is on the east coast of the United States

      - Minnesota (MN) is in the upper Midwest of the United States


      Generally speaking, all of New York state is east of all of Minnesota state.
      The continental United States spans roughly from the Atlantic Ocean in the east
      to the Pacific Ocean in the west, and New York borders the Atlantic while Minnesota
      is in the interior of the country.


      So geographically, any location in New York state would be east of any location
      in Minnesota state. Without even knowing the specific locations of these zip
      codes within their states, I can determine that 11976, NY is east of 55425,
      MN.


      To be more specific about these particular zip codes:

      - 11976 appears to be in Long Island, New York, which is on the eastern end
      of New York state

      - 55425 is likely in the Minneapolis area of Minnesota


      So 11976, NY is definitively east of 55425, MN.


      The answer is YES.</think># Is 11976, NY located east of 55425, MN?


      I need to determine the relative east-west positioning of these two zip codes.


      ## Step 1: Identify the states

      - 11976 is in New York (NY)

      - 55425 is in Minnesota (MN)


      ## Step 2: Consider the geographic locations of these states

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States

      - Minnesota is located in the upper Midwest region


      ## Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - All of New York state lies east of all of Minnesota state

      - The continental US generally follows a pattern where eastern locations have
      lower longitude values than western locations

      - Specifically, 11976 appears to be in Long Island, which is on the eastern
      side of New York

      - 55425 is in the Minneapolis area of Minnesota


      Since New York is entirely east of Minnesota on the US map, any zip code in
      NY (including 11976) must be east of any zip code in MN (including 55425).


      YES'
    7d58bd8c-0dba-4ecb-baea-bb02fade724e: '<think>Alright, I need to determine if
      the zip code 11976 in New York is located east of the zip code 55425 in Minnesota.
      Let me break this down step by step.


      1. First, I need to recognize that this is a question about geographical locations
      within the United States. The question mentions two zip codes: 11976 in New
      York (NY) and 55425 in Minnesota (MN).


      2. To determine whether one location is east of another, I need to consider
      their relative positions on the map of the United States. In the US, east-west
      positioning corresponds to longitude, with eastern locations having smaller
      (less negative) longitude values than western locations.


      3. I know that Minnesota (MN) is located in the Midwest region of the United
      States, while New York (NY) is located on the East Coast.


      4. Generally speaking, the East Coast states like New York are east of Midwestern
      states like Minnesota. This means that locations in New York are typically east
      of locations in Minnesota.


      5. Even without knowing the exact longitude coordinates of these specific zip
      codes, I can be confident that any location in New York state would be east
      of any location in Minnesota based on the general geography of the United States.


      6. Therefore, zip code 11976 in NY should be east of zip code 55425 in MN.


      Let me verify this by thinking about the US map. Moving from west to east across
      the continental United States, we would encounter Minnesota before reaching
      New York. This confirms that New York is east of Minnesota.


      So the answer is YES, 11976, NY is located east of 55425, MN.</think># Is 11976,
      NY located east of 55425, MN?


      I need to determine the relative positions of these two zip codes on the U.S.
      map.


      Step 1: Identify the states

      - 11976 is in New York (NY)

      - 55425 is in Minnesota (MN)


      Step 2: Recall the geographic positions of these states

      - New York is located on the East Coast of the United States

      - Minnesota is located in the Midwest region of the United States


      Step 3: Compare their relative positions

      - When looking at a map of the United States, Minnesota is positioned considerably
      west of New York

      - All of New York state is east of all of Minnesota


      Step 4: Make the conclusion about the specific zip codes

      - Since 11976 is in New York, and 55425 is in Minnesota, the same east-west
      relationship applies to these specific zip codes

      Let me break this down:


      1. 11201 is a zip code in New York (NY)

      2. 90291 is a zip code in California (CA)

      3. I need to determine if the New York zip code is east of the California zip

      Generally speaking, New York is on the East Coast of the United States, while
      California is on the West Coast. So geographically speaking, New York is east
      of California.


      More specifically:

      - New York is in the northeastern part of the United States

      - California is in the western part of the United States


      Since the United States spans from the Atlantic Ocean (east) to the Pacific
      Ocean (west), and New York borders the Atlantic while California borders the
      Pacific, any location in New York would be east of any location in California.

      - New York borders the Atlantic Ocean

      - California borders the Pacific Ocean

      2. 90291 is a zip code in California (CA)

      3. I need to determine if the NY location is east of the CA location


      The United States spans from west to east, with the Pacific Ocean on the west

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 11201 is a zip code in Brooklyn, New York.

      - 90291 is a zip code in the Venice area of Los Angeles, California.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic layout of the United States.

      - California is located on the west coast of the United States.

      - New York is located on the east coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare the relative positions.

      - Moving from west to east across the United States, you would travel from California
      to New York.

      - Therefore, any location in New York (including 11201) is east of any location
      in California (including 90291).

      \ 11201, NY (which is in New York) is east of 90291, CA (which is in California).\n\
      \nTo verify this more precisely, I know that:\n- New York City is roughly at\

      if the zip code 11201 (New York) is east of zip code 90291 (California).


      First, I need to understand the general geographic locations of these zip codes:

      - 11201 is in New York (NY). New York is on the east coast of the United States.

      - 90291 is in California (CA). California is on the west coast of the United
      States.


      In the United States, locations on the east coast are east of locations on the
      west coast. This is because the continental United States spans from the Pacific
      Ocean (west) to the Atlantic Ocean (east).


      Since New York is on the east coast and California is on the west coast, a zip
      code in New York would be east of a zip code in California.


      Therefore, 11201, NY is east of 90291, CA.


      The answer is YES.</think># Is 11201, NY located east of 90291, CA?

      \ and locations further west have higher longitude values. This is because longitude\
      \ is measured in degrees east or west from the Prime Meridian (0\xB0 longitude),\
      \ which runs through Greenwich, London. In the US, all locations are in the\
      \ Western Hemisphere, so they all have negative longitudes (or longitudes expressed\
      \ as \"west\" degrees).\n\nSo the question is basically asking: Does 10013,\
      \ NY have a lower longitude (more negative, or higher \"west\" degrees) than\

      \ the US.\n\nNew York City is at about 74 degrees west longitude, while New\
      \ Orleans is at about 90 degrees west longitude. Since 74 is less than 90, New\

      The question is asking whether 10012, NY is located east of 94043, CA.


      First, I need to identify the locations:

      - 10012 is a ZIP code in New York (NY)

      - 94043 is a ZIP code in California (CA)


      Now, to determine which is east of the other, I need to consider the geographic

      First, I need to identify the locations of these zip codes:

      - 10012, NY: This is a zip code in New York (state of NY)

      - 94043, CA: This is a zip code in California (state of CA)


      To determine which is east of the other, I need to consider the geographic positions
      of these places within the United States.


      The continental United States is oriented such that:

      - The East Coast (including New York) is on the eastern side

      - The West Coast (including California) is on the western side


      California is on the west coast of the United States, while New York is on the
      east coast. This means that any location in New York state would be east of
      any location in California.


      Therefore, 10012, NY (New York) is east of 94043, CA (California).


      So the answer is YES, 10012, NY is located east of 94043, CA.</think># Determining
