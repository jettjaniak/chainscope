      \ Community of Madrid?** To answer this, I'll need to determine the geographical\
      \ locations of both Brussels and the Community of Madrid and compare their latitudes.\n\
      \n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\n- **Brussels**: This is the capital\
      \ city of Belgium, located in Western Europe.\n- **Community of Madrid**: This\
      \ is one of the autonomous communities of Spain, with Madrid as its capital\
      \ city.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Geographical Coordinates\n\nTo compare\
      \ their locations north or south of each other, I need their latitudes.\n\n\
      - **Brussels**:\n  - Latitude: Approximately 50.8503\xB0 N\n  - Longitude: Approximately\
      \ 4.3517\xB0 E\n\n- **Madrid** (as the capital of the Community of Madrid):\n\

      \ or south a location is from the equator. The higher the latitude number, the\
      \ farther north it is.\n\n- Brussels: 50.8503\xB0 N\n- Madrid: 40.4168\xB0 N\n\

      \ Sydney?**\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Locations\n\nFirst, I need to know\
      \ where Singapore Island and Sydney are located geographically.\n\n- **Singapore\
      \ Island** is the main island of the Republic of Singapore, a country in Southeast\
      \ Asia.\n- **City of Sydney** is the capital city of the state of New South\

      \ out whether Pyongyang is located north of both Australia and Cuba. To do this,\
      \ I need to understand the geographical locations of these places. Let's break\
      \ it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identifying Pyongyang, Australia, and\
      \ Cuba\n\n**Pyongyang** is the capital city of North Korea. I know that North\
      \ Korea is located in East Asia, on the northern part of the Korean Peninsula.\n\
      \n**Australia** is a country and continent located in the Southern Hemisphere,\
      \ primarily in the southern and eastern parts of the region.\n\n**Cuba** is\
      \ an island country located in the Caribbean Sea, which is part of the North\
      \ American continent.\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the Concept of \"North\"\n\
      \nWhen we say one place is \"north\" of another, we're referring to its position\
      \ relative to the Earth's North Pole. If a location has a higher latitude (closer\
      \ to the North Pole) than another, it is considered north of it.\n\n### Step\
      \ 3: Comparing Latitudes\n\nTo determine if Pyongyang is north of Australia\
      \ and Cuba, I need to compare their latitudes.\n\n**Pyongyang** is approximately\
      \ at a latitude of 39.0\xB0N.\n\n**Australia** spans from about 10.7\xB0S in\
      \ the north (Cape York) to 43.5\xB0S in the south (Tasmania). Since Australia\
      \ is primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, its latitudes are negative.\n\n**Cuba**\
      \ is located at a latitude of about 21.5\xB0N.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the\
      \ Latitudes\n\nNow, let's compare these latitudes:\n\n- **Pyongyang (39.0\xB0\
      N)** vs. **Australia (~10.7\xB0S to ~43.5\xB0S)**:\n  \n  Since Australia is\
      \ in the Southern Hemisphere (negative latitudes), any location in the Northern\
      \ Hemisphere (positive latitudes) is north of it. Therefore, Pyongyang is north\
      \ of Australia.\n\n- **Pyongyang (39.0\xB0N)** vs. **Cuba (21.5\xB0N)**:\n \
      \ \n  Both are in the Northern Hemisphere. A higher latitude means farther north.\
      \ Since 39.0\xB0N is higher than 21.5\xB0N, Pyongyang is north of Cuba.\n\n\
      ### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBased on the latitude comparisons:\n\n- Pyongyang\
      \ is north of Australia.\n- Pyongyang is north of Cuba.\n\nTherefore, the answer\
      \ to the question \"Is Pyongyang located north of Australia, Cuba?\" is **YES**."

      \ question: **Is Moscow located north of Tahiti?** To answer this, I need to\
      \ understand the geographical locations of both Moscow and Tahiti. Here's how\
      \ I'll approach it:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations of Moscow and Tahiti\n\
      \nFirst, I need to know where Moscow and Tahiti are located on the globe.\n\n\
      - **Moscow**: I recall that Moscow is the capital city of Russia. Russia is\
      \ a vast country spanning Eastern Europe and northern Asia. Moscow is situated\
      \ in the western part of Russia.\n  \n- **Tahiti**: I think Tahiti is an island\
      \ in the Pacific Ocean. It's part of French Polynesia, which is an overseas\
      \ collectivity of France.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Latitudes of Both Locations\n\
      \nTo compare their positions relative to the Earth's north and south, I need\
      \ to know their latitudes.\n\n- **Latitude Basics**: Latitude lines run east-west\
      \ and indicate how far north or south a place is from the equator. The equator\
      \ is at 0 degrees, the North Pole is at 90 degrees north, and the South Pole\
      \ is at 90 degrees south.\n\n- **Moscow's Latitude**: I'm not entirely sure,\
      \ but I think Moscow is located at a relatively high latitude, meaning it's\
      \ closer to the North Pole.\n\n- **Tahiti's Latitude**: Since Tahiti is in the\
      \ Pacific and part of French Polynesia, I believe it's closer to the equator.\n\
      \n### Step 3: Verify the Exact Latitudes\n\nTo get a precise answer, I should\
      \ look up the exact latitudes.\n\n- **Moscow's Latitude**: After a quick search,\
      \ I find that Moscow is located at approximately **55.7558\xB0 N** latitude.\n\
      \n- **Tahiti's Latitude**: Searching further, I discover that Tahiti is around\
      \ **17.6500\xB0 S** latitude.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Latitudes\n\nNow that\
      \ I have both latitudes:\n\n- **Moscow**: 55.7558\xB0 N (North of the equator)\n\
      \  \n- **Tahiti**: 17.6500\xB0 S (South of the equator)\n\nSince Moscow is north\
      \ of the equator and Tahiti is south of the equator, Moscow is definitively\
      \ north of Tahiti.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBased on the latitudes:\n\n\
      - Moscow is at 55.7558\xB0 N.\n  \n- Tahiti is at 17.6500\xB0 S.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ **Moscow is located north of Tahiti**.\n\n**Final Answer: YES**"
