      \n### Step 1: Identify the Locations\n\n- **Brussels**: This is the capital\
      \ city of Belgium, located in Western Europe.\n- **Community of Madrid**: This\
      \ is one of the autonomous communities of Spain, with Madrid as its capital\
      \ city.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Geographical Coordinates\n\nTo compare\
      \ their locations north or south of each other, I need their latitudes.\n\n\
      - **Brussels**:\n  - Latitude: Approximately 50.8503\xB0 N\n  - Longitude: Approximately\

      ### Step 1: Understanding the Locations\n\nFirst, I need to know where Singapore\
      \ Island and Sydney are located geographically.\n\n- **Singapore Island** is\
      \ the main island of the Republic of Singapore, a country in Southeast Asia.\n\
      - **City of Sydney** is the capital city of the state of New South Wales in\

      - **Sydney** is located further south, below the Tropic of Capricorn.\n\n###\
      \ Step 3: Comparing Latitudes\n\nTo determine if Singapore is north of Sydney,\
      \ I'll look at their latitudes.\n\n- **Singapore's latitude** is approximately\
      \ 1.3521\xB0 N.\n- **Sydney's latitude** is approximately 33.8688\xB0 S.\n\n\

      \ it's clear that Singapore is north of the equator, and Sydney is south of\
      \ it.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nGiven that Singapore is north of the equator\

      \ Pyongyang is located north of both Australia and Cuba. To do this, I need\
      \ to understand the geographical locations of these places. Let's break it down\
      \ step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identifying Pyongyang, Australia, and Cuba\n\n\
      **Pyongyang** is the capital city of North Korea. I know that North Korea is\
      \ located in East Asia, on the northern part of the Korean Peninsula.\n\n**Australia**\
      \ is a country and continent located in the Southern Hemisphere, primarily in\
      \ the southern and eastern parts of the region.\n\n**Cuba** is an island country\
      \ located in the Caribbean Sea, which is part of the North American continent.\n\
      \n### Step 2: Understanding the Concept of \"North\"\n\nWhen we say one place\
      \ is \"north\" of another, we're referring to its position relative to the Earth's\
      \ North Pole. If a location has a higher latitude (closer to the North Pole)\
      \ than another, it is considered north of it.\n\n### Step 3: Comparing Latitudes\n\
      \nTo determine if Pyongyang is north of Australia and Cuba, I need to compare\
      \ their latitudes.\n\n**Pyongyang** is approximately at a latitude of 39.0\xB0\
      N.\n\n**Australia** spans from about 10.7\xB0S in the north (Cape York) to 43.5\xB0\
      S in the south (Tasmania). Since Australia is primarily in the Southern Hemisphere,\
      \ its latitudes are negative.\n\n**Cuba** is located at a latitude of about\
      \ 21.5\xB0N.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Latitudes\n\nNow, let's compare these\
      \ latitudes:\n\n- **Pyongyang (39.0\xB0N)** vs. **Australia (~10.7\xB0S to ~43.5\xB0\
      S)**:\n  \n  Since Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere (negative latitudes),\
      \ any location in the Northern Hemisphere (positive latitudes) is north of it.\
      \ Therefore, Pyongyang is north of Australia.\n\n- **Pyongyang (39.0\xB0N)**\
      \ vs. **Cuba (21.5\xB0N)**:\n  \n  Both are in the Northern Hemisphere. A higher\
      \ latitude means farther north. Since 39.0\xB0N is higher than 21.5\xB0N, Pyongyang\
      \ is north of Cuba.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBased on the latitude comparisons:\n\
      \n- Pyongyang is north of Australia.\n- Pyongyang is north of Cuba.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ the answer to the question \"Is Pyongyang located north of Australia, Cuba?\"\
      \ is **YES**."

      \ Moscow located north of Tahiti?** To answer this, I need to understand the\
      \ geographical locations of both Moscow and Tahiti. Here's how I'll approach\
      \ it:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Locations of Moscow and Tahiti\n\nFirst, I\
      \ need to know where Moscow and Tahiti are located on the globe.\n\n- **Moscow**:\
      \ I recall that Moscow is the capital city of Russia. Russia is a vast country\
      \ spanning Eastern Europe and northern Asia. Moscow is situated in the western\
      \ part of Russia.\n  \n- **Tahiti**: I think Tahiti is an island in the Pacific\
      \ Ocean. It's part of French Polynesia, which is an overseas collectivity of\
      \ France.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Latitudes of Both Locations\n\nTo compare\
      \ their positions relative to the Earth's north and south, I need to know their\
      \ latitudes.\n\n- **Latitude Basics**: Latitude lines run east-west and indicate\
      \ how far north or south a place is from the equator. The equator is at 0 degrees,\
      \ the North Pole is at 90 degrees north, and the South Pole is at 90 degrees\
      \ south.\n\n- **Moscow's Latitude**: I'm not entirely sure, but I think Moscow\
      \ is located at a relatively high latitude, meaning it's closer to the North\
      \ Pole.\n\n- **Tahiti's Latitude**: Since Tahiti is in the Pacific and part\
      \ of French Polynesia, I believe it's closer to the equator.\n\n### Step 3:\
      \ Verify the Exact Latitudes\n\nTo get a precise answer, I should look up the\
      \ exact latitudes.\n\n- **Moscow's Latitude**: After a quick search, I find\
      \ that Moscow is located at approximately **55.7558\xB0 N** latitude.\n\n- **Tahiti's\
      \ Latitude**: Searching further, I discover that Tahiti is around **17.6500\xB0\
      \ S** latitude.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Latitudes\n\nNow that I have both\
      \ latitudes:\n\n- **Moscow**: 55.7558\xB0 N (North of the equator)\n  \n- **Tahiti**:\
      \ 17.6500\xB0 S (South of the equator)\n\nSince Moscow is north of the equator\
      \ and Tahiti is south of the equator, Moscow is definitively north of Tahiti.\n\
      \n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBased on the latitudes:\n\n- Moscow is at 55.7558\xB0\
      \ N.\n  \n- Tahiti is at 17.6500\xB0 S.\n\nTherefore, **Moscow is located north\
      \ of Tahiti**.\n\n**Final Answer: YES**"
