      1. First, let''s locate Ibiza:

      - Ibiza is an island in the Mediterranean Sea

      - It is part of Spain

      - It is located in the western Mediterranean, specifically in the Balearic Islands


      2. Now, let''s locate Bali:

      - Bali is an island in Indonesia

      - It is located in Southeast Asia

      - It is situated in the southern hemisphere, near the equator


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - Ibiza is in the Northern Hemisphere (around 38-39 degrees North latitude)

      - Bali is very close to the equator (around 8 degrees South latitude)


      4. Comparing their latitudes:

      - Ibiza is significantly north of Bali

      - The difference in latitude is approximately 38-47 degrees


      5. Conclusion:

      Since Ibiza is located at a much higher latitude than Bali, it is indeed north
      of Bali.

      - Manchester is a city in the northwest of England, United Kingdom

      - It is located in the northern part of Europe


      2. Next, let''s locate the Canary Islands:

      - The Canary Islands are a Spanish archipelago off the northwestern coast of
      Africa

      - They are located in the Atlantic Ocean, relatively close to the coast of Morocco

      - Their latitude is around 28 degrees North


      3. Comparing their latitudes:

      - Manchester is at approximately 53 degrees North

      - The Canary Islands are at approximately 28 degrees North


      4. Comparing their positions:

      - Since Manchester is at a higher latitude (further north) than the Canary Islands,
      Manchester city centre is indeed located north of the Canary Islands
