      song "All Falls Down" was released in 2004. It was a single from his debut studio
      album "The College Dropout".

      "Silhouette" is notable for being the opening theme of the anime series "Naruto:
      Shippuden" but more specifically for our purposes, it was released in 2014 as
      part of their album "Doppel".


      3. **Compare Release Dates**: Given that "All Falls Down" by Kanye West was

      1. **Identify the release year of Marvin Gaye''s "You''re All I Need to Get
      By"**: This song was originally recorded by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell in
      1967.

      album "Thriller" was released in 1982.

    975d469f-707d-48bd-9718-8ff4fb60809e: 'To answer this question,
      let''s first identify the release dates of both songs.


      1. **Michael Jackson''s Thriller**: This song was released in 1982 as part of
      the album of the same name, which is one of the best-selling albums of all time.


      2. **Marvin Gaye''s You''re All I Need to Get By**: This is a cover song originally
      recorded by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell in 1967. The original version of "You''re
      All I Need to Get By" was written by Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson.


      Given these dates:

      - **Thriller** was released in 1982.

      - **You''re All I Need to Get By** was originally released in 1967.


      Comparing the release dates, it''s clear that **You''re All I Need to Get By**
      by Marvin Gaye (and Tammi Terrell) was released significantly earlier than Michael
      Jackson''s **Thriller**.

      we need to determine the release dates of both songs.


      First, let''s identify the release date of Zedd''s "The Middle". "The Middle"
      is a song by Zedd, Maren Morris, and Grey, and it was released on January 23,
      2018.


      Next, we need to find the release date of Janet Jackson''s "That''s the Way
      Love Goes". "That''s the Way Love Goes" was released on April 20, 1993.


      Now, we compare the two release dates. 1993 is earlier than 2018.


      Therefore, since "The Middle" was released in 2018 and "That''s the Way Love
      Goes" was released in 1993, "The Middle" was indeed released later than "That''s
      the Way Love Goes".


      The answer is: YES.'

      and Sound" is a song by the American indie pop duo Capital Cities, from their
      debut studio album, "In a Tidal Wave of Mystery". It was released in 2011 but

      "Bennie and the Jets" was released in 1975 as part of Elton John''s album "Goodbye

      we need to determine the release dates of both songs.


      1. **Identify the release date of Gordon Lightfoot''s "Sundown":** Gordon Lightfoot''s
      song "Sundown" was released in 1974.


      2. **Identify the release date of The Beatles''s "Yellow Submarine":** The Beatles
      released "Yellow Submarine" in 1966. It was part of the soundtrack for the animated
      film of the same name and was included on the album "Revolver" in the UK, though
      in the US, it was initially released on the "Revolver" album in some versions
      and later as part of the "Yellow Submarine" soundtrack album.


      3. **Compare the release dates:** Since "Yellow Submarine" was released in 1966
      and "Sundown" was released in 1974, "Sundown" was released later than "Yellow
      Submarine".


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'
