      later than "Our Song," we need to look at the release dates of both songs.


      Step 1: Identify the release date of "Our Song."

      - "Our Song" is a track from Taylor Swift''s self-titled debut album, "Taylor
      Swift."

      - That album was released in 2006.

      - "Our Song" was released as a single in 2007.


      Step 2: Identify the release date of "Exile."

      the release dates of both songs.


      Step 1: Identify the release date of Ne-Yo''s "So Sick".

      - "So Sick" was released as a single in 2005, and it appeared on his debut album
      "In My Own Words", which came out in February 2006.

      - "Suit & Tie", featuring Jay-Z, was released in January 2013 as the lead single
      from Timberlake''s album "The 20/20 Experience".


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      - Ne-Yo''s "So Sick": 2005 (or early 2006)

      - Justin Timberlake''s "Suit & Tie": 2013
