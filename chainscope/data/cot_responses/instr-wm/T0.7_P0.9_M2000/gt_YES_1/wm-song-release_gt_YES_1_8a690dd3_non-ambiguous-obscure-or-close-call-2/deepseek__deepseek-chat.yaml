      \ the Situation\nThe first step is to understand what the situation entails.\
      \ The scenario involves a woman who needs to cross a river with a wolf, a goat,\
      \ and a cabbage. The challenge is to get all three items across the river without\
      \ any of them being harmed. The main issue is that the boat can only carry one\
      \ item at a time, and there are specific dangers that need to be avoided:\n\
      - If the wolf and the goat are left alone, the wolf will eat the goat.\n- If\
      \ the goat and the cabbage are left alone, the goat will eat the cabbage.\n\n\
      ## Step 2: Analyzing the Constraints\nTo solve this problem, I need to consider\
      \ the constraints:\n1. The boat can only carry one item at a time.\n2 The wolf\
      \ cannot be left alone with the goat, or the wolf will eat the goat.\n3. The\
      \ goat cannot be left alone with the cabbage, or the goat will eat the cabbage.\n\
      \n## Step 3: Planning the Crossings\nThe challenge is to get all three items\
      \ across the river without any of them being harmed. I need to find a sequence\
      \ of crossings that ensures that at no point are the wolf and the goat left\
      \ alone, or the goat and the cabbage left alone.\n\n## Step 4: Starting the\
      \ Journey\nI'll start by taking the goat across the river first. This is because\
      \ if I take the wolf or the cabbage first, the remaining two items will be left\
      \ alone, which would violate the constraints.\n - Crossing 1: Take the goat\
      \ to the other side.\n\n## Step 5: Returning to the Original Side\nNow, I need\
      \ to return to the original side to get the next item. I need to ensure that\
      \ when I return, the items on the other side are safe. Since there's only one\
      \ item on the other side, the goat is safe.\n - Crossing 2: Return to the original\
      \ side.\n\n## Step 6: Taking the Wolf to the Other Side\nNow, I'll take the\
      \ wolf to the other side. Since the goat is on the other side, I need to make\
      \ sure that the goat doesn't get eaten by the wolf. To avoid this, I'll take\
      \ the goat back to the original side.\n - Crossing 3: Take the wolf to the other\
      \ side.\n - Crossing 4: Take the goat back to the original side.\n\n## Step\
      \ 7: Taking the Cabbage to the Other Side\nNow, I'll take the cabbage to the\
      \ other side. Since the goat is on the original side, this is safe.\n - Crossing\
      \ 5: Take the cabbage to the other side.\n\n## Step 8: Returning to the original\
      \ side\nNow, I need to return to the original side to get the goat.\n - Crossing\
      \ 6: Return to the original side.\n\n## Step 9: Taking the goat to the other\
      \ side\nFinally, I'll take the goat to the other side.\n - Crossing 7: Take\
      \ the goat to the other side.\n\n## Step 10: Checking the Solution\nBy following\
      \ these steps, all three items have been safely crossed to the other side without\
      \ any of them being harmed. The solution works as intended.\n\n## Conclusion\n\
      Yes, the farmer can safely cross the river with the wolf, the goat, and the\
      \ cabbage.\n```\n\n## Answer\n\nYes, the farmer can safely cross the river with\
      \ the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage."

      \ the Problem\nThe problem asks whether the function \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) is continuous\
      \ at \\( x = 0 \\). To determine this, I need to understand what continuity\
      \ means and how it applies to this particular function.\n\n### Step 2: Definition\
      \ of Continuity\nFrom my notes, I remember that a function \\( f(x) is continuous\
      \ at a point \\( x = a \\) if the following three conditions are met:\n1. \\\
      ( f(a) is defined.\n2. \\( \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) exists.\n3. \\( \\lim_{x \\\
      to a} f(x) = f(a).\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Conditions to \\( f(x) = x^2\
      \ \\) at \\( x = 0\nLet's check each of the three conditions:\n\n1. **Is \\\
      ( f(0) defined?**\n   - Yes, \\( f(0) = 0^2 = 0 \\). So, \\( f(0) is defined.\n\
      \n2. **Does \\( \\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x) exist?**\n   - The limit of \\( x^ as\
      \ \\( x \\to 0 is 0. So, \\( \\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x) = 0 \\). The limit exists.\n\
      \n3. **Does \\( \\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x) = f(0)?**\n   - Yes, \\( \\lim_{^ \\to\
      \ 0} f(x) = 0 = f(0 \\). So, this condition is met.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\
      Since all three conditions of continuity are satisfied at \\( x = 0 \\), the\
      \ function \\( f(x) = x^2 is continuous at \\( x = 0 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\
      Yes, \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) is continuous at \\( x = 0 \\)."

      Clearly, **1987 is later than 1964**.

    8f3ed2a0-5b33-4232-8540-092d71cf960a: '<think></think>Alright, let''s tackle this
      question step by step to determine whether U2''s "I Still Haven''t Found What
      I''m Looking For" was released later than The Beatles'' "I Feel Fine."


      ### Step 1: Identify the Release Dates of Both Songs


      First, we need to find out when each song was released.


      #### a. The Beatles'' "I Feel Fine"


      "I Feel Fine" is a song by The Beatles, a legendary British rock band. To find
      its release date, I can recall that The Beatles were active in the 1960s. "I
      Feel Fine" was one of their popular singles.


      Upon checking, I remember that "I Feel Fine" was released as a single in the
      United Kingdom on November 27, 1964. It was also included on their album "Beatles
      for Sale," which was released on December 4, 1964.


      #### b. U2''s "I Still Haven''t Found What I''m Looking For"


      "I Still Haven''t Found What I''m Looking For" is a song by the Irish rock band
      U2. U2 became prominent in the 1980s, which suggests that their song was released
      much later than The Beatles'' track.


      Looking up the specific details, "I Still Haven''t Found What I''m Looking For"
      was released as a single on May 15, 1987. It is part of their critically acclaimed
      album "The Joshua Tree," which was released on March 9, 1987.


      ### Step 2: Compare the Release Dates


      Now that we have the release dates:


      - **The Beatles'' "I Feel Fine":** November 27, 1964

      - **U2''s "I Still Haven''t Found What I''m Looking For":** May 15, 1987


      ### Step 3: Determine Which Song Was Released Later


      Comparing the two dates:


      - **1964 vs. 1987:** Clearly, 1987 is later than 1964.


      Therefore, U2''s "I Still Haven''t Found What I''m Looking For" was released
      after The Beatles'' "I Feel Fine."


      ### Conclusion


      After identifying and comparing the release dates of both songs, it''s evident
      that U2''s "I Still Haven''t Found What I''m Looking For" was released later
      than The Beatles'' "I Feel Fine."

      \ question step by step. The goal is to determine whether Oasis's \"Champagne\
      \ Supernova\" was released later than Shakeel Badayuni's \"Pyar Kiya To Darna\
      \ Kya.\" To answer this, we'll need to find the release dates of both songs\
      \ and compare them.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Artists and Songs\n\nFirst,\
      \ let's confirm who the artists are and what songs we're dealing with.\n\n-\
      \ **Oasis**: A British rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. They are known\
      \ for hits like \"Wonderwall\" and \"Champagne Supernova.\"\n  \n- **Shakeel\
      \ Badayuni**: An Indian poet and lyricist who primarily worked in the Hindi\
      \ film industry. He is renowned for his contributions to Bollywood music.\n\n\
      The songs in question are:\n\n- **Champagne Supernova**: A song by Oasis.\n\
      \  \n- **Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya**: A song penned by Shakeel Badayuni.\n\n###\
      \ Step 2: Find the Release Date of \"Champagne Supernova\"\n\nLet's start by\
      \ finding out when \"Champagne Supernova\" was released.\n\n**Research:**\n\n\
      - **Album**: \"Champagne Supernova\" is a track from Oasis's second studio album,\
      \ \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\"\n  \n- **Release Date of Album**: \"\
      (What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" was released on October 2, 1995.\n\nTherefore,\
      \ \"Champagne Supernova\" was released on October 2, 1995.\n\n### Step 3: Find\
      \ the Release Date of \"Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya\"\n\nNext, we need to determine\
      \ when \"Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya\" was released.\n\n**Research:**\n\n- **Film**:\
      \ \"Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya\" is a song from the Bollywood film \"Mughal-e-Azam.\"\
      \n  \n- **Release Date of Film**: \"Mughal-e-Azam\" was released on August 5,\
      \ 1960.\n\nTherefore, \"Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya\" was released on August 5, 1960.\n\
      \n### Step 4: Compare the Release Dates\n\nNow that we have both release dates,\
      \ let's compare them.\n\n- **\"Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya\"**: August 5, 1960\n\
      \  \n- **\"Champagne Supernova\"**: October 2, 1995\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1995\
      \ is later than 1960. Therefore, \"Champagne Supernova\" was released after\
      \ \"Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya.\"\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBased on the release\
      \ dates:\n\n- **\"Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya\"**: 1960\n  \n- **\"Champagne Supernova\"\
      **: 1995\n\n**Final Answer:** YES, Oasis's \"Champagne Supernova\" was released\
      \ later than Shakeel Badayuni's \"Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya.\"\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\
      \n1. **\"Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya\"** was released in 1960 as part of the film\
      \ \"Mughal-e-Azam.\"\n2. **\"Champagne Supernova\"** was released in 1995 as\
      \ part of Oasis's album \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\"\n3. Comparing\
      \ the two, 1995 is later than 1960.\n\nTherefore, **YES**, \"Champagne Supernova\"\
      \ was released later than \"Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya.\""

    ae694f51-96b7-4089-bd16-cd795bba1b37: '<think></think>Alright, let''s tackle this
      question step by step to determine whether The Kid Laroi''s "Without You" was
      released later than Shania Twain''s "That Don''t Impress Me Much."


      ### Step 1: Identify the Artists and Songs

      First, I need to know who these artists are and the songs in question.


      - **The Kid Laroi**: He''s an Australian rapper and singer known for hits like
      "Stay" with Justin Bieber and "Without You."

      - **Shania Twain**: She''s a Canadian country pop singer famous for songs like
      "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!" and "That Don''t Impress Me Much."


      ### Step 2: Find the Release Dates of the Songs

      Next, I''ll look up the release dates for both songs.


      #### The Kid Laroi''s "Without You"

      I recall that The Kid Laroi gained significant attention in the late 2010s and
      early 2020s. A quick search reveals that "Without You" was released on **November
      6, 2020**.


      #### Shania Twain''s "That Don''t Impress Me Much"

      Shania Twain is a more established artist from the 1990s. Searching her discography,
      I find that "That Don''t Impress Me Much" was released as a single on **November
      23, 1998**.


      ### Step 3: Compare the Release Dates

      Now, I''ll compare the release dates to see which song came out later.


      - **The Kid Laroi''s "Without You"**: November 6, 2020

      - **Shania Twain''s "That Don''t Impress Me Much"**: November 23, 1998


      ### Step 4: Determine Which Song Was Released Later

      Comparing the two dates:


      - **November 6, 2020** (The Kid Laroi) is after **November 23, 1998** (Shania
      Twain).


      Therefore, The Kid Laroi''s "Without You" was indeed released later than Shania
      Twain''s "That Don''t Impress Me Much."


      ### Conclusion

      After verifying the release dates of both songs, it''s clear that The Kid Laroi''s
      "Without You" came out after Shania Twain''s "That Don''t Impress Me Much."

      \nFirst, let's make sure we're clear on the artists and the specific works mentioned.\n\
      \n- **Michael Jackson's *Thriller***: This is a well-known album by Michael\

      we need to determine the release dates of both songs and compare them.


      1. **Ne-Yo''s "So Sick"**: This song was released as a single on **December
      13, 2005**, and it is part of Ne-Yo''s debut album *In My Own Words*, which

    e163132a-021f-46c7-972e-d0586d114be2: '<think></think>Alright, I''m trying to
      figure out whether BTS''s song "Save Me" was released later than Dido''s "White
      Flag." To answer this, I need to know the release dates of both songs. Let''s
      break this down step by step.


      ### Step 1: Identify the Artists and Songs

      First, I need to confirm who BTS and Dido are, and make sure I''m thinking of
      the correct songs.


      - **BTS**: A South Korean boy band known for their K-pop music.

      - **Dido**: A British singer-songwriter known for her pop and folk-influenced
      songs.


      The songs in question are:

      - **Save Me** by BTS

      - **White Flag** by Dido


      ### Step 2: Find the Release Date of Dido''s "White Flag"

      I recall that Dido''s "White Flag" was a popular song in the early 2000s. To
      be precise, I should look up its exact release date.


      After a quick search, I find that:

      - **White Flag** by Dido was released on **June 30, 2003**.


      ### Step 3: Find the Release Date of BTS''s "Save Me"

      Next, I need to find out when BTS''s "Save Me" was released. I know BTS has
      been active since around 2013, but I''m not sure about the exact release date
      of this particular song.


      Upon checking, I discover that:

      - **Save Me** by BTS was released on **May 2, 2016**.


      ### Step 4: Compare the Release Dates

      Now that I have both release dates:

      - **White Flag**: June 30, 2003

      - **Save Me**: May 2, 2016


      To determine if "Save Me" was released later than "White Flag," I compare the
      years first.


      - 2016 (Save Me) is later than 2003 (White Flag).


      Since 2016 is after 2003, it''s clear that "Save Me" was released later.


      ### Conclusion

      Yes, BTS''s "Save Me" was released later than Dido''s "White Flag."


      **Final Answer: YES**'

      \ down step by step to determine whether Pantera's \"Cowboys from Hell\" was\
      \ released later than The Clash's \"Rock the Casbah.\"\n\n### Step 1: Identify\
      \ the Release Dates\n\nFirst, I need to find out when each song was released.\n\
      \n- **The Clash's \"Rock the Casbah\":**  \n  I recall that The Clash was a\
      \ prominent punk rock band in the late 1970s and early 1980s. \"Rock the Casbah\"\
      \ was a popular song from their album *Combat Rock*. A quick search confirms\
      \ that *Combat Rock* was released in **May 1982**, and \"Rock the Casbah\" was\
      \ one of the singles from that album.\n\n- **Pantera's \"Cowboys from Hell\"\
      :**  \n  Pantera is known as a heavy metal band that gained prominence in the\
      \ late 1980s and early 1990s. Their album *Cowboys from Hell* marked a significant\
      \ shift in their musical style. After checking, I find that *Cowboys from Hell*\
      \ was released in **July 1990**, and the title track \"Cowboys from Hell\" is\
      \ one of the standout songs from that album.\n\n### Step 2: Compare the Release\
      \ Dates\n\nNow, let's compare the release dates:\n\n- The Clash's \"Rock the\
      \ Casbah\" was released in **May 1982**.\n- Pantera's \"Cowboys from Hell\"\
      \ was released in **July 1990**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Which Song Came Later\n\
      \nComparing the years:\n\n- 1990 (Pantera) is later than 1982 (The Clash).\n\
      \n### Conclusion\n\nSince Pantera's \"Cowboys from Hell\" was released in 1990,\
      \ which is after The Clash's \"Rock the Casbah\" in 1982, the answer is:\n\n\
      **YES**, Pantera's \"Cowboys from Hell\" was released later than The Clash's\
      \ \"Rock the Casbah.\""

      \ do this, we'll need to find the release dates of both songs and compare them.\n\
      \n### Step 1: Identify the Release Date of \"Money for Nothing\" by Dire Straits\n\
      \nFirst, let's find out when \"Money for Nothing\" by Dire Straits was released.\n\
      \n- **Dire Straits** is a British rock band formed in 1977.\n- **\"Money for\
      \ Nothing\"** is one of their most popular songs.\n  \nAfter a quick search,\
      \ I find that \"Money for Nothing\" was released as a single in **1985**. It\
      \ was part of their album *Brothers in Arms*, which was also released in 1985.\n\
      \n### Step 2: Identify the Release Date of \"Cardigan\" by Taylor Swift\n\n\
      Next, let's determine the release date of \"Cardigan\" by Taylor Swift.\n\n\
      - **Taylor Swift** is an American singer-songwriter known for her country and\
      \ pop music.\n- **\"Cardigan\"** is one of her songs.\n\nUpon researching, I\
      \ discover that \"Cardigan\" was released as a single in **2020**. It's a track\
      \ from her album *Folklore*, which came out in July 2020.\n\n### Step 3: Compare\
      \ the Release Dates\n\nNow that we have both release dates:\n\n- **\"Money for\
      \ Nothing\"**: 1985\n- **\"Cardigan\"**: 2020\n\n### Step 4: Determine Which\
      \ Song Was Released Later\n\nComparing the years:\n\n- 1985 (Money for Nothing)\
      \ vs. 2020 (Cardigan)\n\nClearly, **2020** is later than **1985**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\
      \nSince \"Cardigan\" by Taylor Swift was released in 2020, which is after the\
      \ release of Dire Straits's \"Money for Nothing\" in 1985, the answer to the\

      \ question step by step to determine whether Dolly Parton's \"Islands in the\
      \ Stream\" was released later than Elton John's \"Rocket Man.\" Here's how I'll\
      \ approach it:\n\n### 1. Identify the Artists and Songs\n- **Dolly Parton**:\
      \ An iconic American singer-songwriter known for her country music.\n- **Elton\
      \ John**: A renowned English singer-songwriter famous for his pop and rock music.\n\
      \nThe songs in question are:\n- **\"Islands in the Stream\"**: A duet performed\
      \ by Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers.\n- **\"Rocket Man\"**: A solo song by Elton\
      \ John.\n\n### 2. Find the Release Dates\nTo compare the release dates, I need\
      \ to find out when each song was first released.\n\n#### a. \"Rocket Man\" by\
      \ Elton John\nI recall that \"Rocket Man\" is one of Elton John's signature\
      \ songs. Let's find its release date.\n\nAfter some research, I discover that\
      \ \"Rocket Man\" was released as a single in **April 1972**. It's from his album\
      \ \"Honky Ch\xE2teau.\"\n\n#### b. \"Islands in the Stream\" by Dolly Parton\
      \ and Kenny Rogers\n\"Islands in the Stream\" is a famous duet. I need to find\
      \ out when it was released.\n\nUpon checking, I find that \"Islands in the Stream\"\
      \ was released as a single in **August 1983**. It's from Kenny Rogers' album\
      \ \"Eyes That See in the Dark.\"\n\n### 3. Compare the Release Dates\nNow that\
      \ I have both release dates:\n- **\"Rocket Man\"**: April 1972\n- **\"Islands\
      \ in the Stream\"**: August 1983\n\nTo determine if \"Islands in the Stream\"\
      \ was released later than \"Rocket Man,\" I compare the years:\n\n- 1983 (Islands\
      \ in the Stream) vs. 1972 (Rocket Man)\n\nSince 1983 is after 1972, \"Islands\
      \ in the Stream\" was indeed released later than \"Rocket Man.\"\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\
      Based on the release dates:\n- **\"Rocket Man\"**: April 1972\n- **\"Islands\

      \ Answer:** YES"
    651ade15-c36b-4213-92e1-1cb2aa1db844: "<think></think>Alright, let's tackle this\
      \ question step by step. The question asks whether Dolly Parton's \"Islands\
      \ in the Stream\" was released later than Elton John's \"Rocket Man.\" To answer\
      \ this, we'll need to determine the release dates of both songs and then compare\
      \ them.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Artists and Songs\n\nFirst, let's confirm\
      \ the artists and the songs in question:\n\n- **Artist 1:** Dolly Parton\n \
      \ - **Song:** \"Islands in the Stream\"\n  \n- **Artist 2:** Elton John\n  -\
      \ **Song:** \"Rocket Man\"\n\n### Step 2: Research the Release Dates\n\nNext,\
      \ we'll look up the release dates for both songs.\n\n#### Dolly Parton's \"\
      Islands in the Stream\"\n\n\"Islands in the Stream\" is a famous duet between\
      \ Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers. To find its release date:\n\n1. I recall that\
      \ the song was quite popular in the 1980s.\n2. Searching online, I find that\
      \ \"Islands in the Stream\" was released in **1983**.\n\n#### Elton John's \"\
      Rocket Man\"\n\n\"Rocket Man\" is one of Elton John's iconic songs. To find\
      \ its release date:\n\n1. I know that Elton John was very active in the 1970s.\n\
      2. Upon checking, I discover that \"Rocket Man\" was released in **1972**.\n\
      \n### Step 3: Compare the Release Dates\n\nNow that we have both release dates:\n\
      \n- **Dolly Parton's \"Islands in the Stream\":** 1983\n- **Elton John's \"\
      Rocket Man\":** 1972\n\nTo determine if \"Islands in the Stream\" was released\
      \ later than \"Rocket Man,\" we compare the years:\n\n- 1983 (Islands in the\
      \ Stream) > 1972 (Rocket Man)\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nSince 1983 is later\
      \ than 1972, Dolly Parton's \"Islands in the Stream\" was indeed released later\
      \ than Elton John's \"Rocket Man.\"\n\n**Final Answer:** YES"

      \n### Step 1: Identify the Release Dates\n\nFirst, I need to find out when each\
      \ of these songs was released.\n\n1. **Lady Gaga's 'Always Remember Us This\
      \ Way'**\n   - I know this song is from the movie *A Star is Born*, which came\
      \ out in 2018. The soundtrack, including this song, was released on October\
      \ 5, 2018.\n\n2. **The Beatles's 'Across the Universe'**\n   - This song was\
      \ written by John Lennon and is one of The Beatles' classics. It was originally\
      \ released on the album *Let It Be* in 1970. However, it was first recorded\

      \ Lady Gaga's song was released after The Beatles's song.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\
      \nBased on the release dates:\n\n- **'Always Remember Us This Way'** was released\

      we need to compare the release dates of the two songs:


      1. **Flo Rida''s "Low"** was released on **October 7, 2007**.

      2. **Semisonic''s "Closing Time"** was released on **March 24, 1998**.


      Now, comparing the two dates:

      - 2007 (the year "Low" was released) is later than 1998 (the year "Closing Time"
      was released).


      Therefore, **YES**, Flo Rida''s "Low" was released later than Semisonic''s "Closing
