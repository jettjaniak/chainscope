      1. First, I''ll find the release date for "Low" by Flo Rida:

      - "Low" was released in 2007

      - Specifically, it was released in October 2007


      2. Next, I''ll find the release date for "Closing Time" by Semisonic:

      - "Closing Time" was released in 1998

      - Specifically, it was released in April 1998


      3. Comparing the two dates:

      - 2007 is later than 1998

      - Therefore, Flo Rida''s "Low" was released later than Semisonic''s "Closing
      Time"
