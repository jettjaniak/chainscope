      which song was released first.


      Step 1: Identify when Lynyrd Skynyrd''s "Sweet Home Alabama" was released.

      - "Sweet Home Alabama" was released in June 1974 as the second single from their
      album "Second Helping."


      Step 2: Identify when The Cure''s "Boys Don''t Cry" was released.

      - "Boys Don''t Cry" was originally released in June 1979 as a single, and later
      appeared on the American version of their debut album.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      - Sweet Home Alabama: June 1974

      - Boys Don''t Cry: June 1979

      - 1979 is 5 years after 1974


      Step 4: Determine which came later.

      - Since 1979 comes after 1974, The Cure''s "Boys Don''t Cry" was released later
      than Lynyrd Skynyrd''s "Sweet Home Alabama."


      NO - The Cure''s "Boys Don''t Cry" was NOT released earlier than Lynyrd Skynyrd''s
      "Sweet Home Alabama." It was released later.


      Wait, I need to carefully read the question again. The question asks if Boys
      Don''t Cry was released LATER than Sweet Home Alabama.


      Since Boys Don''t Cry (1979) was indeed released later than Sweet Home Alabama
      (1974), the answer is:


      YES'
    fa834bb9-9ed5-4c81-ad0e-38a0956ca150: 'I''ll solve this step by step by determining
      when each song was released.


      Step 1: Determine when "Sweet Home Alabama" by Lynyrd Skynyrd was released.

      - "Sweet Home Alabama" was released in 1974 as part of Lynyrd Skynyrd''s second
      album "Second Helping."


      Step 2: Determine when "Boys Don''t Cry" by The Cure was released.

      - "Boys Don''t Cry" was originally released in 1979 as a single.

      - It was later included on the American version of their debut album.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      - Sweet Home Alabama: 1974

      - Boys Don''t Cry: 1979

      - 1979 is later than 1974


      Therefore, The Cure''s "Boys Don''t Cry" was released later than Lynyrd Skynyrd''s
      "Sweet Home Alabama."


      NO


      Wait, I made an error in my final answer. The question asks if "Boys Don''t
      Cry" was released later than "Sweet Home Alabama," and since 1979 is indeed
      later than 1974, the correct answer is:


      YES'
