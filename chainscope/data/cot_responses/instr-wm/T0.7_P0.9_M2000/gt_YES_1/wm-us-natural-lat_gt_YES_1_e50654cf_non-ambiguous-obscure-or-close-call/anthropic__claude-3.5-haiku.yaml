      1. First, let''s recall the locations of Lake Michigan and Lake Erie in the
      Great Lakes region.


      2. Lake Michigan is located west of Lake Erie, and Lake Michigan is more northwest
      compared to Lake Erie.


      3. In the Great Lakes system, Lake Michigan is located in the northwestern part
      of the region, while Lake Erie is more to the east and southeast.


      4. When we look at a map, Lake Michigan is indeed north of Lake Erie.


      5. Therefore, the answer is: YES, Lake Michigan is located north of Lake Erie.

    2b754a52-54b7-46c4-a084-de408c84e1cc: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s recall the geographic location of Lake Michigan and Lake Erie
      within the Great Lakes region.


      2. Lake Michigan is located west of Lake Erie.


      3. The Great Lakes are arranged roughly from west to east in this order: Superior,
      Michigan, Huron, Erie, Ontario.


      4. Since Lake Michigan is west of Lake Erie, and "north" refers to a higher
      latitude, we need to check their latitudes.


      5. Lake Michigan is located at approximately 44-46 degrees North latitude.


      6. Lake Erie is located at approximately 42-43 degrees North latitude.


      7. Since Lake Michigan has a higher latitude than Lake Erie, it is indeed located
      north of Lake Erie.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
