      Chandra Barot''s "Don" is a classic Bollywood film starring Amitabh Bachchan
      that was released in 1978.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      1987 (Wall Street) comes after 1978 (Don), meaning Wall Street was released

      Chandra Barot''s "Don" is a Bollywood film starring Amitabh Bachchan. I believe

      than Chandra Barot''s "Don".</think>To answer this question, I need to determine
      when each film was released.


      Step 1: Identify when Oliver Stone''s "Wall Street" was released.

      - "Wall Street" was released in December 1987 in the United States.


      Step 2: Identify when Chandra Barot''s "Don" was released.

      - "Don" is a Bollywood film directed by Chandra Barot starring Amitabh Bachchan.

      - It was released in 1978.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      - 1987 is later than 1978.

      - Therefore, "Wall Street" was released 9 years after "Don".


      YES'
    73ca1cf3-aadb-4d81-8b94-98d9aa90971c: '<think>I need to determine when these two

      First, Oliver Stone''s "Wall Street" - this is a well-known film starring Michael

      Second, Chandra Barot''s "Don" - this is a Bollywood film. Let me think about
      when it was released. If I recall correctly, the original "Don" directed by
      Chandra Barot and starring Amitabh Bachchan was released in 1978. (There was
      a remake in 2006 directed by Farhan Akhtar, but the question specifically mentions
      Chandra Barot''s "Don").

      - Wall Street: 1987

      - Don: 1978


      Comparing the two: 1987 is later than 1978. So Wall Street was released later

      1987 (Wall Street) comes after 1978 (Don), so Oliver Stone''s film was released

      - It was released in 1998


      So comparing:

      - The Waterboy: 1998

      of two Bollywood works:

      1. Rakesh Roshan''s Krrish series

      2. Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui

      For Krrish series:

      - The first movie in the Krrish series was actually "Koi... Mil Gaya" (2003)

      - The first movie titled "Krrish" came out in 2006

      - "Krrish 3" was released in 2013


      For Aashiqui:

      - The original "Aashiqui" directed by Mahesh Bhatt was released in 1990

      - There was a sequel "Aashiqui 2" in 2013, but that wasn''t directed by Mahesh
      Bhatt


      Since the original Aashiqui was released in 1990, and the Krrish series started
      with Koi Mil Gaya in 2003 and the first actual Krrish film in 2006, the Krrish
      series was definitely released later than Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to identify when each film series was released.


      First, let''s look at Mahesh Bhatt''s "Aashiqui":

      - The original "Aashiqui" directed by Mahesh Bhatt was released in 1990

      - While there was a sequel "Aashiqui 2" in 2013, the original Mahesh Bhatt film
      from 1990 is what we''re focusing on


      Now for Rakesh Roshan''s "Krrish" series:

      - The series actually began with "Koi... Mil Gaya" in 2003

      - The first film titled "Krrish" was released in 2006

      - "Krrish 3" followed in 2013


      Comparing these timelines:

      - Aashiqui: 1990

      - Krrish series: Began in 2003


      Since the Krrish series started 13 years after Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui, the
      Krrish series was released later.

      1. Was Rakesh Roshan''s Krrish series released later than Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui?


      I need to determine the release years of both film series:


      Krrish series:

      The Krrish series is a Bollywood superhero franchise directed by Rakesh Roshan.
      It began with:

      - Koi... Mil Gaya (2003) - technically the first film in the series

      - Krrish (2006) - the first film with the "Krrish" title

      - Krrish 3 (2013) - sequel


      Aashiqui:

      Aashiqui is a romantic film directed by Mahesh Bhatt that was released in 1990.

      There was a sequel called Aashiqui 2 (2013), but it was directed by Mohit Suri,
      not Mahesh Bhatt.


      Comparing:

      - Aashiqui: 1990

      - Krrish series: Started in 2003 with Koi... Mil Gaya, and the first "Krrish"
      titled film was in 2006


      Since 2003/2006 is later than 1990, the Krrish series was indeed released later
      than Mahesh Bhatt''s Aashiqui.</think>To answer this question, I need to identify
      when these two film properties were released.


      Mahesh Bhatt''s "Aashiqui":

      - "Aashiqui" was released in 1990

      - It was a romantic musical film directed by Mahesh Bhatt


      Rakesh Roshan''s "Krrish" series:

      - The Krrish franchise began with "Koi... Mil Gaya" in 2003

      - The first film actually titled "Krrish" was released in 2006

      - Later installments came in subsequent years (like "Krrish 3" in 2013)

      - Aashiqui: 1990

      - The first film in the series was actually "Koi... Mil Gaya" (2003)

      - Krrish (the first film with that title) was released in 2006

      - Krrish 3 was released in 2013

      - Later installments came in subsequent years (Krrish 3 in 2013).


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      - Aashiqui: 1990

      - Krrish series: Started in 2003/2006

      For "The Chronicles of Narnia" directed by Andrew Adamson, I believe this refers
      to "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" which was
      released in 2005. (Adamson also directed the sequel "Prince Caspian" in 2008,
      but the first film is typically what would be referred to).


      For "Bobby" directed by Raj Kapoor, this is a Bollywood film that was released
      in 1973.


      Comparing the dates:

      - "Bobby": 1973

      - "The Chronicles of Narnia": 2005


      Since 2005 is later than 1973, Andrew Adamson''s "The Chronicles of Narnia"
      was released later than Raj Kapoor''s "Bobby."</think>I need to determine the
      release dates of both films to answer this question.


      Step 1: Identify Andrew Adamson''s "The Chronicles of Narnia" film.

      This would refer to "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"
      which was released in 2005. (Adamson also directed the sequel "Prince Caspian"
      in 2008, but the first film is typically what would be referenced.)


      Step 2: Identify when Raj Kapoor''s "Bobby" was released.

      "Bobby" is a classic Bollywood film directed by Raj Kapoor that was released
      in 1973.


      Step 3: Compare the release dates.

      - "Bobby": 1973

      - "The Chronicles of Narnia": 2005


      Since 2005 comes after 1973, The Chronicles of Narnia was released later than
      Bobby.

      in 2005. But let me make sure I have the right film and director.


      2. Raj Kapoor''s "Bobby" - I need to find when this Bollywood film was released.


      Andrew Adamson did direct "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and

      2. "Aradhana" directed by Shakti Samanta


      Let me recall the release years for each:


      "The Grudge" by Takashi Shimizu: I believe this was a Japanese horror film (originally
      titled "Ju-On") that got an American remake also directed by Shimizu. The American
      version of "The Grudge" was released in 2004, starring Sarah Michelle Gellar.
      The original Japanese version was released around 2002-2003.


      "Aradhana" by Shakti Samanta: This is a classic Indian film starring Rajesh
      Khanna and Sharmila Tagore. It was released much earlier, I believe in the late
      1960s or early 1970s, around 1969-1970.


      So comparing these dates:

      - "The Grudge": approximately 2002-2004

      - "The Grudge" is a horror film directed by Takashi Shimizu

      - It was released in 2004 (there was a Japanese original called "Ju-On" earlier,
      but "The Grudge" specifically refers to the American remake)


      Now for Shakti Samanta''s "Aradhana":

      - "Aradhana" is a Bollywood film directed by Shakti Samanta

      - It was released in 1969

      2004 comes after 1969, so "The Grudge" was released later than "Aradhana".</think>I''ll
      analyze the release dates of both films to determine the answer.


      First, Takashi Shimizu''s "The Grudge":

      - This is a Japanese horror film (also remade for American audiences)

      - "The Grudge" was released in 2004

      3) Then compare the two dates to determine if "The Grudge" was released later
      than "Aradhana"


      For "The Grudge" directed by Takashi Shimizu:

      This Japanese horror film (or its American remake) was released in the early
      2000s. The original Japanese version "Ju-On: The Grudge" came out around 2002,
      while the American remake simply titled "The Grudge" was released in 2004.


      For "Aradhana" directed by Shakti Samanta:
