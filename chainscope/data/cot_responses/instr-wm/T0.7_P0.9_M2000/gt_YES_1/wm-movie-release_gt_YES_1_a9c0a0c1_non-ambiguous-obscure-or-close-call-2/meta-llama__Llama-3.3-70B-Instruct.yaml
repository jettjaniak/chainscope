      by Mahesh Bhatt, was released in 1990.


      2. **Identify the release year of Rakesh Roshan''s Krrish series**: The Krrish

      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify Release Year of The Grudge**: Takashi Shimizu''s The Grudge, also
      known as "Ju-On: The Grudge," was initially released in 2002 in Japan. However,
      it''s worth noting that the film was part of a series, with the first "Ju-On"
      film released in 2000. The American remake, also titled "The Grudge," was released
      in 2004. For the purpose of this comparison, we''ll consider the original Japanese
      release year of 2002 for the specific film mentioned.


      2. **Identify Release Year of Aradhana**: Shakti Samanta''s Aradhana was released
      in 1969. This is a key piece of information for our comparison.


      3. **Compare Release Years**: Now, we compare the release years of the two films.
      The Grudge (considering the 2002 release) was released much later than Aradhana,
      which was released in 1969.


      Based on these steps, it is clear that Takashi Shimizu''s The Grudge was released
      later than Shakti Samanta''s Aradhana.

      we need to follow these steps:


      1. Identify the release year of Takashi Shimizu''s The Grudge.

      2. Identify the release year of Shakti Samanta''s Aradhana.

      3. Compare the two release years to determine which film was released later.


      Step 1: The release year of Takashi Shimizu''s The Grudge is 2004 (the original
      Japanese version, "Ju-On: The Grudge," was released in 2002, but the American
      remake, also directed by Shimizu, came out in 2004).


      Step 2: The release year of Shakti Samanta''s Aradhana is 1969.


      Step 3: Comparing the two release years, 2004 (The Grudge) is later than 1969
      (Aradhana).


      Therefore, the answer to whether Takashi Shimizu''s The Grudge was released
      later than Shakti Samanta''s Aradhana is:


      YES.'

      1. First, identify the release year of Takashi Shimizu''s The Grudge. The Grudge,
      also known as Ju-On: The Grudge, was initially released in 2002 in Japan. However,
      the version most people are familiar with, which was more widely released internationally,

      release.


      2. Next, identify the release year of Shakti Samanta''s Aradhana. Aradhana was
      released in 1969.


      3. Compare the release years. The Grudge was released in 2002, and Aradhana
      was released in 1969.


      Given that 2002 is indeed later than 1969, we can conclude that The Grudge was
