      \n### Step 1: Identify the Release Dates of Both Movies\n\nFirst, I need to\
      \ find out the release years of both movies.\n\n- **Harry Potter and the Deathly\
      \ Hallows**: This is a two-part film, with *Part 1* and *Part 2*. I need to\
      \ confirm which part the question is referring to or if it's considering both.\n\
      \  \n  - *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1* was released in\
      \ **2010**.\n  - *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2* was released\
      \ in **2011**.\n\n- **The Waterboy**: This is a comedy film starring Adam Sandler.\
      \ I recall it being a late '90s movie.\n\n  - *The Waterboy* was released in\
      \ **1998**.\n\n### Step 2: Compare the Release Dates\n\nNow, let's compare the\
      \ release years:\n\n- *The Waterboy*: **1998**\n- *Harry Potter and the Deathly\
      \ Hallows \u2013 Part 1*: **2010**\n- *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\
      \ \u2013 Part 2*: **2011**\n\nClearly, both parts of *Harry Potter and the Deathly\
      \ Hallows* were released **after** *The Waterboy*.\n\n### Step 3: Address Any\
      \ Potential Ambiguities\n\nThe question mentions *Harry Potter and the Deathly\
      \ Hallows* without specifying if it's Part 1 or Part 2. However, since both\
      \ parts were released after *The Waterboy*, it doesn't affect the final answer.\n\
