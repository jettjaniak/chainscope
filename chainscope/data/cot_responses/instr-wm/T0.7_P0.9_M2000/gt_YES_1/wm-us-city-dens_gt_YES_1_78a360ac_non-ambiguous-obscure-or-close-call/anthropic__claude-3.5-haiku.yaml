    2a502196-a15b-40c7-9bc0-7651c75e9ca0: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Population Density is calculated by dividing total population by land area.


      2. Manhattan, NY:

      - Very compact island

      - Extremely dense urban environment

      - High-rise buildings everywhere

      - Estimated population density around 70,000 people per square mile


      3. Malibu, CA:

      - Coastal city in California

      - Much more spread out

      - Lots of large individual properties

      - Lower population density, estimated around 1,000 people per square mile


      4. Comparing the two:

      - Manhattan''s population density is dramatically higher

      - Manhattan is one of the most densely populated areas in the United States

      - Malibu is relatively sparsely populated


      5. Conclusion: Manhattan is MUCH more densely populated than Malibu.
