      - They are typically assigned geographically, with lower numbers generally indicating
      more northern or eastern locations


      2. Let''s look at the first digits of these zip codes:

      - Zip codes starting with 119 are typically on Long Island (eastern New York)


      4. Long Island is located east and south of Manhattan


      5. Therefore, 11954 is located south and east of 10025, not north

      \ let's look at the zip codes:\n   - 11976 is in NY\n   - 10014 is in NY\n\n\
      2. In the US zip code system, the first digit indicates a general geographic\
      \ region:\n   - Zip codes starting with 1 are in the Northeast (primarily New\
      \ York and New England)\n   - Zip codes starting with 11 are in Long Island,\
