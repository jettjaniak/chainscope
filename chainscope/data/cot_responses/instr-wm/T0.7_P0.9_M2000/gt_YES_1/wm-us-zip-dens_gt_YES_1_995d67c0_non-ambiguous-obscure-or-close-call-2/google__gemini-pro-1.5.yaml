      2. **Determine how to compare population density:**  Population density is population
      divided by area. We need to find population and area data for each zip code.

      3. **Find a reliable source for population and area data:**  The US Census Bureau

      the Census.

      a densely populated area, and 11976 is Water Mill, NY, a more rural area in
      the Hamptons. This gives a *preliminary* hunch, but we need real numbers.)

      5. **Calculate population density for each zip code:** Once population and area
      are found, divide population by area for each.

      that 90291, CA (Venice) is more densely populated than 11976, NY (Water Mill).

      align with zip code boundaries.  Therefore, finding precise population density
      for a specific zip code can be challenging.  We might need to rely on estimates.
