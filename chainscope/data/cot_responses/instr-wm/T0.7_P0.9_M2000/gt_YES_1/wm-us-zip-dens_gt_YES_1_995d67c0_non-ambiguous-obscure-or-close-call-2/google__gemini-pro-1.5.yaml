      2. **Determine how to compare population density:**  Population density is population
      divided by area. We need to find population and area data for each zip code.

      a densely populated area, and 11976 is Water Mill, NY, a more rural area in
      the Hamptons. This gives a *preliminary* hunch, but we need real numbers.)

      are found, divide population by area for each.

      2. **General knowledge:** Manhattan is known for its extremely high population
      density, being an island with a large number of high-rise buildings.  Las Vegas,
      while a major city, is more spread out and less densely populated than Manhattan.
