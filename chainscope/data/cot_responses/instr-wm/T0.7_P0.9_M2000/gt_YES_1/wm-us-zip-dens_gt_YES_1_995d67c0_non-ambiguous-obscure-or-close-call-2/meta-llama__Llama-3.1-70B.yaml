      we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: The zip codes 90210 and 11954 represent Beverly
      Hills, California, and East Moriches, New York, respectively.

      2. **Understand what density means**: Population density refers to the number
      of people living in a specific area, usually expressed in people per square
      mile or square kilometer.

      3. **Find the population and area of each zip code**: We can use data sources
      like the United States Census Bureau or other demographic databases to find
      the population and area of each zip code.

      4. **Calculate the population density**: Divide the population by the area to
      get the population density.

      5. **Compare the densities**: Determine which zip code has a higher population
      density.


      Based on general knowledge and available data:

      - Beverly Hills, CA (90210) is known for being a densely populated, affluent
      area within Los Angeles County, with a high concentration of residential and
      commercial properties.

      - East Moriches, NY (11954) is a hamlet and census-designated place located
      in Suffolk County, known for having more open spaces and less density compared
      to areas like Beverly Hills.


      Given the nature of these locations, it''s reasonable to infer that:

      - Beverly Hills is likely to have a higher population density due to its urban
      setting and high concentration of people and businesses.

      - East Moriches is likely to have a lower population density due to its more
      suburban/rural setting and larger area.


      Therefore, based on this reasoning, the answer to whether 90210, CA is more
      densely populated than 11954, NY is:


      **YES**'

      NY is more densely populated than 90028, CA, we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: 10007, NY refers to a zip code in New York City,
      while 90028, CA refers to a zip code in Los Angeles, California.


      2. **Understand what is being asked**: We are comparing the population density
      of these two areas.


      3. **Find population and area data**: To compare population density, we need
      the population and the area of each zip code. Population density is calculated
      as the population divided by the area.


      4. **Compare the densities**: Once we have the population densities of both
      areas, we can compare them to determine which is more densely populated.


      Given the nature of the locations:

      - New York City (10007) is known for being one of the most densely populated
      cities in the United States.

      - Los Angeles (90028) is a large and sprawling city, but it is generally less
      densely populated compared to the core of New York City.


      Without needing the exact numbers, we can infer based on general knowledge:

      - New York City is one of the most densely populated urban areas in the United
      States.

      - Los Angeles, while being a major city, has a lower population density compared
      to the heart of New York City.

      we need to follow these steps:


      1. **Identify the locations**: 10011, NY refers to a zip code in New York City,
      specifically in Manhattan. 70116, LA refers to a zip code in New Orleans, Louisiana.

      2. **Understand what is being asked**: We are comparing the population density
      of these two zip code areas.

      3. **Find population data**: To compare population density, we need the population
      and the area (in square miles or kilometers) of each zip code.

      4. **Calculate population density**: Population density is calculated by dividing
      the population by the area of the location.

      5. **Compare the densities**: Once we have the population densities of both
      areas, we can determine which one is more densely populated.


      Given the nature of the locations:

      - **Manhattan, NY (10011)** is known for being a densely populated, urban area
      within New York City.

      - **New Orleans, LA (70116)**, while also urban, is known for having a different
      demographic and geographic layout compared to Manhattan, often with more open
      spaces and potentially less density.


      Without needing exact figures, we can infer based on the general characteristics
      of these areas:

      - Manhattan is one of the most densely populated urban areas in the United States.

      - New Orleans, while also urban, typically has a different demographic and geographic
      layout compared to Manhattan, often with more open spaces and potentially less
      density.

      NY refers to Water Mill, New York.

      2. **Understand what is being asked**: We are comparing the population density

      3. **Find population and area data**: To compare population density, we need
      the population and the area (in square miles or kilometers) of each zip code.

      Given the nature of the locations:

      - **Venice, CA (90291)** is known for being a densely populated, urban area
      within Los Angeles County, with a high concentration of residential and commercial
      properties.
