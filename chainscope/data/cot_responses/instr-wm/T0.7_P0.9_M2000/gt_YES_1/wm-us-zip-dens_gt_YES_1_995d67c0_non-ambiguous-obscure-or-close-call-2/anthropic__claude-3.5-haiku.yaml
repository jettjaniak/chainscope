    0afbf4a0-c7df-4989-acd0-640e7ef1f2b5: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I recognize 90210 as Beverly Hills, California, which is a very well-known,
      affluent urban area.


      2. 11954 appears to be a zip code in New York, specifically in Suffolk County
      on Long Island.


      3. Beverly Hills (90210) is a small, dense city within Los Angeles County, with
      an area of about 5.7 square miles.


      4. The population density of Beverly Hills is quite high, around 6,000 people
      per square mile.


      5. 11954 is in the Westhampton Beach area, which is more suburban/rural, with
      lower population density.


      6. Westhampton Beach has a much larger geographic area and fewer people per
      square mile compared to Beverly Hills.


      7. Therefore, 90210 (Beverly Hills) is more densely populated than 11954 (Westhampton
      Beach).

    92ff3058-e320-441a-8f60-976f698a9e14: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. 10013 is a zip code in New York City, specifically in Lower Manhattan (Tribeca/SoHo
      area)

      - Manhattan is extremely densely populated

      - This zip code is in the heart of New York City

      - Urban area with many high-rise apartments and condos


      2. 94027 is a zip code in Atherton, California

      - Located in Silicon Valley, in San Mateo County

      - Known as an affluent suburban area

      - Large single-family homes with significant property sizes

      - Much lower population density compared to Manhattan


      3. Population density comparison:

      - Manhattan is one of the most densely populated areas in the United States

      - Atherton is a low-density suburban area

      - The population per square mile in 10013 is dramatically higher than in 94027


      4. Conclusion reasoning:

      - Urban Manhattan zip code (10013) will have far more people per square mile

      - Suburban California zip code (94027) has much lower population density


      Therefore, the answer is: YES, 10013, NY is more densely populated than 94027,

      \ SoHo/Greenwich Village area, which is extremely densely populated.\n   - Manhattan\
      \ is the most densely populated county in the United States\n   - This specific\
      \ zip code is in a very compact, urban neighborhood with many high-rise residential\
      \ buildings\n\n3. 70130 is in the French Quarter of New Orleans, which is also\
      \ urban but less densely populated than Manhattan.\n   - The French Quarter\
      \ has historic buildings, many of which are shorter and less densely packed\n\
      \   - New Orleans overall has much lower population density compared to New\
      \ York City\n\n4. Comparing population densities:\n   - Manhattan's population\
      \ density is around 70,000 people per square mile\n   - New Orleans' population\
      \ density is around 2,000 people per square mile\n   - Manhattan's density is\
      \ significantly higher\n\n5. Therefore, the zip code in Manhattan (10012) is\
      \ much more densely populated than the zip code in New Orleans (70130).\n\n\
