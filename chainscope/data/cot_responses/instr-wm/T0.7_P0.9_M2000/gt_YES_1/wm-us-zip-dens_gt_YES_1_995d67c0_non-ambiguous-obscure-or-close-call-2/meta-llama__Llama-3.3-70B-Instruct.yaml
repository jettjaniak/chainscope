      2. **Understand what is being asked**: We are comparing the population density
      of these two zip code areas.

      3. **Find population data**: To compare population density, we need the population
      and the area (in square miles or kilometers) of each zip code.

      4. **Calculate population density**: Population density is calculated by dividing
      the population by the area of the location.

      5. **Compare the densities**: Once we have the population densities of both
      areas, we can determine which one is more densely populated.


      Given the nature of the locations:

      - **Beverly Hills, CA (90210)** is known for being a densely populated, affluent
      area within Los Angeles County, with a high concentration of residential and
      commercial properties.

      - **East Moriches, NY (11954)**, in contrast, is a hamlet and census-designated

      \ zip codes provided: 10023 in New York (NY) and 02554 in Massachusetts (MA).\n\
      \n1. **Understanding Zip Codes**: Zip codes are postal codes used by the United\
      \ States Postal Service (USPS) to route mail and packages. Each zip code represents\
      \ a specific geographic area, which can range from a small town to a large city\
      \ or even a group of cities.\n\n2. **Population Density**: Population density\
      \ is calculated by dividing the number of people living in a given area by the\
      \ size of that area. It's usually expressed as the number of people per square\
      \ mile or square kilometer.\n\n3. **Identifying the Areas**: \n   - **10023,\
      \ NY**: This zip code corresponds to the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New\
      \ York City. Manhattan is known for being one of the most densely populated\
      \ urban areas in the United States.\n   - **02554, MA**: This zip code corresponds\
      \ to Nantucket, Massachusetts. Nantucket is an island off the coast of Cape\
      \ Cod and has a significant but seasonal population due to tourism.\n\n4. **Comparing\
      \ Population Densities**:\n   - Manhattan (10023) is part of New York City,\
      \ which has a very high population density. According to the United States Census\
      \ Bureau, the population density of Manhattan is approximately 72,033 people\
      \ per square mile.\n   - Nantucket (02554), while popular for tourism, has a\
      \ significantly lower population density compared to Manhattan. The island has\
      \ a total area of about 48 square miles and, as of the 2020 census, a year-round\
      \ population of around 11,000 people, which translates to a population density\
      \ of about 229 people per square mile.\n\nBased on these considerations, it's\
      \ clear that 10023 in New York is more densely populated than 02554 in Massachusetts.\n\
      \nThe answer is: **YES**"

      1. **Identify the Cities**: First, we need to identify the cities associated
      with these zip codes. The zip code 10011 is associated with New York City, NY,
      and 70116 is associated with New Orleans, LA.


      2. **Population of Zip Codes**: Next, we need to find the population of each

      1. **Identify the locations**: 90291, CA refers to a zip code in California,
      and 11976, NY refers to a zip code in New York.

      2. **Determine the areas**: Knowing the exact areas covered by these zip codes
      can be complex, as zip code boundaries can be irregular and may include both
      urban and rural areas. However, we can proceed with a general understanding
      that these areas are subject to varying population densities.

      3. **Research population densities**: To compare the population densities, we
      need data on the population and the area of each zip code. Population density
      is calculated by dividing the population by the area.

      4. **Find data sources**: The United States Census Bureau and other demographic

      for these zip codes.

      5. **Compare the densities**: Once we have the population and area data for

      - **90291, CA** is located in Beverly Hills, California, which is known for

      - **11976, NY** is located in Water Mill, New York, which is part of the Hamptons,
      known for being an affluent but less densely populated area compared to major
      urban centers like Beverly Hills.


      Based on this general knowledge, it is reasonable to infer that an urban area
      like Beverly Hills (90291, CA) would be more densely populated than an area
      like Water Mill (11976, NY), which is more suburban or rural in nature.

      Given the complexity and the need for specific, up-to-date data on population

      areas like Beverly Hills.


      Based on this general information, one might infer that 90291, CA, is more densely

      \ 89109 is a zip code in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n2. **Understand Population Density**:\
      \ Population density is calculated by dividing the number of people by the area\

      \ NY), according to the United States Census Bureau (data from 2020 or the latest\
      \ available), the population and area would need to be looked up. Let's assume\
