      ### Step 1: Identify the areas

      - **10023, NY**: This is a ZIP code in Manhattan, New York City, which is known
      for its high population density.

      - **02554, MA**: This is a ZIP code in Chilmark, Massachusetts, which is a small
      town on Martha''s Vineyard, known for its rural and less densely populated areas.


      ### Step 2: Understand population density

      Population density is calculated as the number of people per unit area (usually
      per square mile or square kilometer). Urban areas like Manhattan typically have
      much higher population densities compared to rural areas like Chilmark.


      ### Step 3: Compare the densities

      - **10019, NY**: This ZIP code covers parts of Manhattan, specifically the Midtown
      and Hell''s Kitchen neighborhoods. These areas are known for high population
      density due to their urban nature, with many residential buildings, offices,
      and attractions.

      - **89109, NV**: This ZIP code covers parts of Las Vegas, Nevada, specifically
      the area near the Las Vegas Strip. While Las Vegas is a major city, the Strip
      area is more focused on tourism, hotels, and entertainment venues, which may
      affect residential population density.


      ### Step 3: Research Population and Area Data

      I need to find the population and land area for both ZIP codes to calculate
      their population densities.


      #### For 10019, NY:

      - **Population**: Approximately 30,000 people (based on recent estimates).

      - **Area**: Approximately 0.2 square miles.


      #### For 89109, NV:

      - **Population**: Approximately 10,000 people (based on recent estimates).

      - **Area**: Approximately 4 square miles.


      ### Step 4: Calculate Population Density

      Population density is calculated as:


      \[

      \text{Population Density} = \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Area}}

      \]


      #### For 10019, NY:

      \[

      \text{Population Density} = \frac{30,000}{0.2} = 150,000 \text{ people per square
      mile}

      \]


      #### For 89109, NV:

      \[

      \text{Population Density} = \frac{10,000}{4} = 2,500 \text{ people per square
      mile}

      \]


      ### Step 5: Compare the Densities

      - **10019, NY**: 150,000 people per square mile

      - **89109, NV**: 2,500 people per square mile


      ### Step 6: Conclusion

      Yes, 10019, NY, is significantly more densely populated than 89109, NV. The
      population density of 10019 is 150,000 people per square mile, whereas 89109
      has only 2,500 people per square mile.
