      1. 55425 is in Bloomington, Minnesota

      2. 90265 is in Malibu, California


      3. Looking up population density:

      - Bloomington 55425 has approximately 3,000 people per square mile

      - Malibu 90265 has approximately 650 people per square mile


      4. 3,000 > 650, therefore Bloomington is more densely populated than Malibu


      The Bloomington zip code is more commercial/suburban while Malibu, despite being
      well-known, is actually quite spread out along the coast with many hills and
      canyons.


      NO: 55425, MN is NOT more densely populated than 90265, CA


      [Correction: I made a mistake in my reasoning. 55425 (Bloomington) IS actually
      more densely populated than 90265 (Malibu). The correct answer should be YES.]


      YES'

      1. Let me identify these zip codes:

      - 55425 is in Bloomington, Minnesota

      - 90265 is in Malibu, California


      2. Let me find population density data:

      - Bloomington 55425 has a population density of about 2,800 people per square
      mile

      - Malibu 90265 has a population density of about 700 people per square mile


      3. Compare the numbers:

      2,800 > 700


      4. Reasoning:

      The Bloomington zip code is an urban/suburban area near Minneapolis, while the
      Malibu zip code, despite being in California, is a coastal area with large estates
      and lots of open space.


      NO


      (The answer is NO because 55425, MN is NOT more densely populated than 90265,
      CA - I apologize for my initial calculation error. I had the comparison backwards
      in my head when writing the final answer. The correct data shows that 55425
      Bloomington is actually MORE densely populated than 90265 Malibu, so the answer
      to the original question is YES)
