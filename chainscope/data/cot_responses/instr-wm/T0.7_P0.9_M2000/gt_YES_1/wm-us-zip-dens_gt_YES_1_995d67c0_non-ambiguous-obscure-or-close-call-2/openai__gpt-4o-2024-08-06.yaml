      in California is more densely populated than 11954 in New York, we need to consider
      the population density of each area. Population density is typically measured
      as the number of people per square mile.


      **Step 1: Identify the areas represented by the zip codes.**

      - 90210 is the zip code for Beverly Hills, California, which is part of the
      Los Angeles metropolitan area.

      - 11954 is the zip code for Montauk, New York, which is located at the eastern
      tip of Long Island.


      **Step 2: Consider the characteristics of each area.**

      - Beverly Hills is a well-known, affluent city that is part of a densely populated
      metropolitan area. It has a high population density due to its urban setting
      and limited land area.

      - Montauk is a more rural, coastal area known for its beaches and resorts. It
      is less densely populated, with larger areas of open space and fewer residents.


      **Step 3: Research population density data.**

      - According to available data, Beverly Hills (90210) has a high population density,
      as expected for an urban area in Los Angeles County.

      - Montauk (11954), being a more rural and recreational area, has a much lower
      population density.

      in California is more densely populated than 11954 in New York, we need to consider
      population density, which is typically calculated as the number of people per
      square mile.


      ### Step 1: Identify the locations and characteristics

      - **90210, CA**: This zip code is primarily associated with Beverly Hills, a
      city known for its affluent population and urban setting.

      - **11954, NY**: This zip code corresponds to Montauk, a more rural area known
      for being a fishing village and a tourist destination, particularly in the summer
      months.


      ### Step 2: Consider typical population densities

      - Urban areas like Beverly Hills generally have higher population densities
      due to more residential buildings and less open space compared to rural or semi-rural
      areas.

      - Montauk, being a more rural and seasonal area, likely has lower population
      density, with more open space and fewer residents year-round.


      ### Step 3: Research or infer population and area size

      - **90210, CA**: Beverly Hills has a relatively high population density as it
      is an urban area with many residential and commercial buildings.

      - **11954, NY**: Montauk, with its more rural character and seasonal population
      fluctuations, generally has a lower population density.


      ### Conclusion

      Given the urban nature of 90210 (Beverly Hills) compared to the more rural and
      seasonal character of 11954 (Montauk), it is reasonable to conclude that 90210,
      CA is more densely populated than 11954, NY.

      density, as Manhattan is one of the most densely populated places in the United
      States.

      - **90028, CA**: While Hollywood is a well-known area, Los Angeles generally
      has a lower population density compared to Manhattan.

      \ in New York is more densely populated than 90069 in California, we need to\
      \ consider a few key factors:\n\n1. **Geographic Location and Size**:\n   -\
      \ **10036 (New York, NY)**: This ZIP code covers part of Midtown Manhattan,\
      \ including areas such as Times Square. Manhattan is known for its high population\
      \ density.\n   - **90069 (West Hollywood, CA)**: This ZIP code covers parts\
      \ of West Hollywood and neighboring areas. While urban, it typically has lower\
      \ density compared to central Manhattan.\n\n2. **Population Data**:\n   - **10036**:\
      \ As part of Midtown Manhattan, this area is characterized by a high density\
      \ of residential and commercial buildings, leading to a high population density.\n\
      \   - **90069**: While West Hollywood is also densely populated, it generally\
      \ does not reach the same levels of density as Midtown Manhattan.\n\n3. **Density\
      \ Comparison**:\n   - Historically, Manhattan ZIP codes, including 10036, are\
      \ among the most densely populated in the United States.\n   - West Hollywood\
      \ is dense by Los Angeles standards but generally less dense than central Manhattan\
      \ areas.\n\nBased on these considerations, the ZIP code 10036 in New York is\
      \ more densely populated than 90069 in California.\n\n**Answer**: YES"
