      Manhattan is known to have some of the highest population densities in the United
      States, particularly in its core areas. Lower Manhattan specifically has extremely
      high daytime population densities due to office workers, though residential
      density is also very high. Hollywood is dense by Los Angeles standards but Los
      Angeles as a whole is less densely populated than New York City.


      Step 5: Make a conclusion based on this reasoning.

      Based on urban geography patterns, Manhattan zip codes typically have significantly

      - Manhattan is known for being extremely densely populated with high-rise buildings
      and apartments.

      - Hollywood is densely populated but generally less so than Manhattan.


      Step 3: Look at specific characteristics of these zip codes.

      - 10007 includes parts of the Financial District in Manhattan, with many high-rise
      office and residential buildings.

      - 90028 is in Hollywood, which has a mix of commercial and residential areas
      but fewer high-rise residential buildings than Manhattan.

      Step 3: Think about the characteristics of these areas.

      - 10007 is in Lower Manhattan, which includes parts of the Financial District
      and Tribeca in New York City. Manhattan is known for being extremely densely
      populated with high-rise buildings.

      - 90028 is in Hollywood, Los Angeles. While this is an urban area, Los Angeles
      generally has lower population density than Manhattan due to more spread-out

      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - 10007 is in New York, NY (specifically in Lower Manhattan)

      - 90028 is in California, CA (specifically in Hollywood, Los Angeles)


      Step 2: Consider what determines population density.

      Population density = Total population / Area


      Step 3: Analyze 10007, NY.

      This is in Lower Manhattan, which is one of the most densely populated areas
      in the United States. Lower Manhattan is a major business district but also
      has high-rise residential buildings.


      Step 4: Analyze 90028, CA.

      lower building heights and density compared to Manhattan.


      Step 5: Compare the characteristics.

      Manhattan ZIP codes typically have extremely high population densities due to
      the concentration of high-rise buildings in a small area. Lower Manhattan specifically

      developed as Manhattan.


      Step 5: Compare the typical characteristics

      Manhattan zip codes typically have extremely high population densities (often

      Let me think through this step by step:


      1) 10019 is a zip code in New York City, specifically in Midtown Manhattan,
      which includes parts of the Theater District and Midtown West.


      2) 89109 is a zip code in Las Vegas, Nevada, which includes parts of the Las
      Vegas Strip and surrounding areas.


      3) To compare population density, I need to consider both the population and
      the area of each zip code.


      4) Manhattan is known for being one of the most densely populated urban areas
      in the United States, with high-rise residential buildings and a concentrated
      population.


      5) The Las Vegas Strip area (89109) has many large hotels and casinos, but fewer
      permanent residents compared to its geographic size.


      6) Midtown Manhattan (10019) has both commercial buildings and high-density
      residential housing, with many apartment buildings accommodating thousands of
      residents in a small area.


      7) New York City as a whole has a population density far exceeding that of Las
      Vegas, and this pattern would likely hold true when comparing these specific
      zip codes.


      Based on this analysis of urban development patterns and typical population
      distribution in these areas, I can conclude:


      YES, 10019 (NY) is more densely populated than 89109 (NV).'

      4) Manhattan is known for being one of the most densely populated urban areas
      in the United States, with high-rise residential buildings and a concentrated
      population.


      5) While the Las Vegas Strip has many large hotels, the actual residential population
      density is much lower than Manhattan, as much of the space is dedicated to casinos,
      hotels, and entertainment venues rather than residential housing.


      6) Midtown Manhattan (10019) has extremely high population density with numerous
      apartment buildings and residential towers in a compact area.


      7) The Las Vegas Strip area (89109) has a more spread-out development pattern
      with large hotel complexes and fewer permanent residents.


      Based on these considerations of the urban characteristics of both areas, I
      can conclude:


      YES, zip code 10019 in New York is more densely populated than zip code 89109
      in Nevada.'

      - 10019 is in New York, NY (specifically in Midtown Manhattan)

      - 89109 is in Las Vegas, NV (specifically includes the Las Vegas Strip area)


      Step 2: Consider population density factors.

      - Manhattan is known for being one of the most densely populated urban areas
      in the US

      - The Las Vegas Strip has many hotels and attractions but fewer permanent residents


      Step 3: Compare typical population densities.

      - Midtown Manhattan (10019) has high-rise residential buildings with many permanent
      residents packed into a small area

      - Las Vegas Strip (89109) has large hotel complexes that take up significant
      space but house temporary visitors rather than permanent residents


      Step 4: Evaluate the specific zip codes.

      - 10019 includes parts of Midtown Manhattan with many residential high-rises

      - 89109 includes the Las Vegas Strip with large casino properties that take
      up substantial space


      Based on this analysis, zip code 10019 in New York has significantly more permanent
      residents per square mile than zip code 89109 in Nevada. Manhattan zip codes
      typically have among the highest population densities in the country, while
      the Las Vegas Strip area has relatively fewer permanent residents spread across
      large commercial properties.

      Manhattan is known for extremely high population density with many high-rise
      residential buildings packed closely together. The 10019 zip code includes parts
      of Midtown Manhattan with many residential high-rises.


      The Las Vegas Strip area (89109) has many large hotels and casinos, but relatively
      fewer permanent residents compared to its land area. While it has many visitors,
      actual population density of residents is much lower than Manhattan.


      Based on these considerations, the population density (residents per square
      mile) is significantly higher in Manhattan''s 10019 than in Las Vegas''s 89109.
