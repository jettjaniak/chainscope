      - Chicago, IL has approximately 2.7 million residents.

      - Houston, TX has approximately 2.3 million residents.

      - Chicago''s population (2.7 million) is larger than Houston''s population (2.3
      million).

      - While exact numbers fluctuate, Chicago has historically been the 3rd largest
      city in the US, while Houston has been the 4th largest.

      - However, in recent years, Houston has been growing faster than Chicago, with
      Chicago actually losing some population.

      - Despite this trend, based on the most recent reliable data, Chicago still
      maintains a higher population than Houston.
