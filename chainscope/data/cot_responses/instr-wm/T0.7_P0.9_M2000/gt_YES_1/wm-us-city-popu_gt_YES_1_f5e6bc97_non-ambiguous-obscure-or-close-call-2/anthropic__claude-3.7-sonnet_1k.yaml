      step by trying to recall the approximate populations of these two cities:


      Orlando, FL:

      - Orlando is a major city in Florida

      - It''s one of the larger cities in Florida, though not the largest

      - I would estimate its population to be at least several hundred thousand residents

      - Compton is a city in Los Angeles County, California

      - It''s essentially a suburb within the greater Los Angeles area

      - While well-known culturally, it''s not one of the larger cities in California

      Universal Studios). It has a population of approximately 300,000-350,000 people

      Let me think about the populations of these two places:


      1. Dallas, TX is one of the largest cities in Texas and is a major metropolitan
      area in the United States.

      2. The Bronx is one of the five boroughs of New York City, not a separate city
      itself.


      I should recall their approximate populations:


      Dallas, TX: The population is approximately 1.3-1.4 million people for the city
      proper.


      The Bronx, NY: The Bronx has a population of approximately 1.4-1.5 million people.


      These are close, but based on my knowledge, the Bronx has slightly more residents
      than the city of Dallas. I should note that if we were comparing metropolitan
      areas, the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex would be much larger than just the Bronx,
      but the question is specifically about Dallas the city versus the Bronx borough.</think>To
      answer this question, I need to compare the populations of Dallas, TX and the
      Bronx, NY.


      Step 1: Identify what Dallas and the Bronx are administratively.

      Dallas is an independent city in Texas. The Bronx is one of the five boroughs
      of New York City.


      Step 2: Consider their respective populations.

      Dallas has a population of approximately 1.3-1.4 million people.

      The Bronx has a population of approximately 1.4-1.5 million people.


      Step 3: Make the direct comparison.

      While these populations are close, the Bronx generally has slightly more residents
      than the city of Dallas proper. The Bronx typically exceeds Dallas by around
      100,000-200,000 residents.

      has approximately 450,000-500,000 people within the city limits. However, the
      greater Miami metropolitan area is much larger, with several million residents.


      Las Vegas, NV:

      Las Vegas is the largest city in Nevada. The city proper has approximately 650,000-700,000
      residents. Like Miami, the Las Vegas metropolitan area is larger than the city
      proper.

      - Miami: ~450,000-500,000

      - Las Vegas: ~650,000-700,000

      cities proper (not metropolitan areas).


      Step 3: Verify the comparison.

      Boston is a city in Massachusetts. Queens is one of the five boroughs of New

      - Boston, MA: approximately 700,000-800,000 people

      Queens is significantly more populous than Boston. Queens is actually one of
      the most populous boroughs in New York City, while Boston, while a major city,
      is not among the very largest US cities by population.


      So the answer is that Boston is NOT more populous than Queens. In fact, Queens
      has roughly 3 times the population of Boston.</think>I need to compare the populations

      Boston has approximately 675,000-700,000 residents.

      Queens has approximately 2.2-2.3 million residents.

      Miami Beach is a smaller city in Florida. It''s not the same as Miami (which
      is larger). Miami Beach has a population of approximately 90,000-100,000 people.

      large margin.</think>To answer this question, I need to compare the populations
      of Los Angeles, CA and Miami Beach, FL.


      Step 1: Consider Los Angeles, CA.

      Los Angeles is the second-largest city in the United States with a population
      of approximately 4 million people.


      Step 2: Consider Miami Beach, FL.

      Miami Beach is a coastal resort city in Florida, which is much smaller than
      Los Angeles. It has a population of approximately 90,000-100,000 people.


      Step 3: Compare the two populations.

      Los Angeles (about 4 million) is roughly 40 times larger than Miami Beach (about

      population decline since its peak in the mid-20th century. In recent years,
      its population has been roughly 600,000-700,000 people.

      Detroit, MI:

      Detroit has experienced significant population decline over recent decades.
      At its peak in the 1950s, it had about 1.8 million people, but has declined
      substantially since then. As of recent estimates (around 2020-2022), Detroit''s

      Austin, TX:

      Austin has been one of the fastest-growing major cities in the US for several
      years. As of recent estimates (around 2020-2022), Austin''s population is approximately
      950,000-1 million residents.

      million residents.

      Detroit, MI was historically one of America''s largest cities due to the auto
      industry, but it has faced significant population decline over recent decades.
      As of the latest data I''m aware of (around 2020-2021), Detroit''s population

      Detroit, Michigan was historically one of America''s major industrial centers,

      population decline over the past several decades. According to recent census
      data, Detroit has a population of approximately 670,000-680,000 residents.


      Austin, Texas has experienced substantial growth in recent decades as it has
      become a major technology hub and cultural center. Its population has been growing
      rapidly, and recent data shows Austin with approximately 950,000-1,000,000 residents.


      Comparing these figures, Austin (with about 950,000+ people) is clearly more
