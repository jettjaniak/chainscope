      the age at death of both Alighiero di Bellincione and Osama bin Laden, then
      compare those ages.


      Step 1: Determine who Alighiero di Bellincione was.

      - Alighiero di Bellincione was the father of the famous Italian poet Dante Alighieri.

      - Historical records suggest Alighiero was born around 1210 and died around
      1283 (dates are approximate because records are sparse).

      - Based on these dates, he would have been approximately 73 years old at the
      time of his death.


      Step 2: Determine the age at death of Osama bin Laden.

      - Osama bin Laden was born on March 10, 1957.

      - He died on May 2, 2011.

      - That means he was 54 years old when he died.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Alighiero di Bellincione: approximately 73 years old.

      - Osama bin Laden: 54 years old.


      Since 73 > 54, the answer is:


      YES.'

      Step 1: Who was Alighiero di Bellincione?

      - He was an Italian nobleman, best known as the father of Dante Alighieri, the
      famous poet.

      - Alighiero di Bellincione was born around 1210 and died around 1283.

      - That would make his age at death approximately: 1283 - 1210 = 73 years old.


      Step 2: Who was Osama bin Laden?

      - Osama bin Laden was born on March 10, 1957, and died on May 2, 2011.

      - That would make his age at death: 2011 - 1957 = 54 years old.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death:

      - Alighiero di Bellincione: ~73 years

      - Osama bin Laden: 54 years


      Final Step: Determine who was older at the time of death.

      - Rosa Parks was born in 1913 and died in 2005.

      - So, 2005 - 1913 = 92 years old at the time of her death.


      Step 2: Determine Ho Chi Minh''s birth and death years.

      - Ho Chi Minh was born in 1890 and died in 1969.

      - So, 1969 - 1890 = 79 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Rosa Parks: 92 years old

      - Ho Chi Minh: 79 years old


      Since 92 > 79, Rosa Parks was older at the time of her death than Ho Chi Minh.

      who was older at the time of death: Rosa Parks or Ho Chi Minh.


      **Step 1: Determine Rosa Parks''s birth and death dates.**


      - Rosa Parks was born on February 4, 1913.

      - Rosa Parks died on October 24, 2005.


      So, she lived from 1913 to 2005.


      To calculate her age at death:


      2005 - 1913 = 92 years.


      Since she died after her birthday in February, she was 92 years old.


      **Step 2: Determine Ho Chi Minh''s birth and death dates.**


      - Ho Chi Minh was born on May 19, 1890.

      - Ho Chi Minh died on September 2, 1969.


      So, he lived from 1890 to 1969.


      To calculate his age at death:


      1969 - 1890 = 79 years.


      Since he died after his birthday in May, he was 79 years old.


      **Step 3: Compare their ages at death.**


      - Rosa Parks: 92 years old.

      - Ho Chi Minh: 79 years old.

      1. Determine the age at death of George H. W. Bush.

      2. Determine the age at death of Abu Bakr.

      3. Compare the two ages to see who was older.


      **Step 1: Age at death of George H. W. Bush**

      - George H. W. Bush was born on June 12, 1924.

      - He died on November 30, 2018.

      - From June 12, 1924, to June 12, 2018, he turned 94 years old.

      - He died a few months later in November 2018, so he was still 94 years old
      at the time of death.


      **Step 2: Age at death of Abu Bakr**

      - Abu Bakr, the first Caliph of Islam, was born in 573 CE.

      - He died in 634 CE.

      - Therefore, he was approximately 61 years old at the time of his death.


      **Step 3: Compare the two ages**

      - George H. W. Bush: 94 years old.

      - Abu Bakr: 61 years old.

      step.


      Step 1: Determine the birth and death years of Alfred Hitchcock.

      - Alfred Hitchcock was born in 1899 and died in 1980.

      - So, he lived to be 1980 - 1899 = 81 years old.


      Step 2: Determine the birth and death years of Francis of Assisi.

      - Francis of Assisi was born in 1181 or 1182 (there is some uncertainty), and
      he died in 1226.

      - Assuming he was born in 1181, he lived to be 1226 - 1181 = 45 years old.

      - Assuming he was born in 1182, he lived to be 1226 - 1182 = 44 years old.

      - So, he was either 44 or 45 at the time of his death.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Alfred Hitchcock: 81 years old.

      - Francis of Assisi: 44 or 45 years old.


      Conclusion:

      Since 81 is greater than both 44 and 45, Alfred Hitchcock was older at the time

    73ed591e-36b0-45d5-a68f-62c39d0bf0ff: 'Sure, let''s break this down step by step
      to determine whether Woodrow Wilson was older at the time of his death than
      John the Baptist.


      **Step 1: Determine the age at death of Woodrow Wilson**

      - Woodrow Wilson was born on December 28, 1856.

      - He died on February 3, 1924.

      - That means he lived from December 28, 1856 to February 3, 1924.

      - So, he was 67 years old when he died (a little over 67 years).


      **Step 2: Determine the age at death of John the Baptist**

      - John the Baptist is a biblical figure. Exact birth and death dates are not
      definitively known.

      - However, based on historical and biblical estimates, John the Baptist was
      likely born around the same time as Jesus, perhaps slightly earlier.

      - Jesus began his ministry around age 30, and John the Baptist was active slightly
      before Jesus.

      - John the Baptist was executed during the early part of Jesus''s ministry.

      - This suggests John the Baptist was probably in his early 30s or possibly late
      20s when he died.


      **Step 3: Compare the ages**

      - Woodrow Wilson: 67 years old.

      - John the Baptist: likely around 30 years old.


      **Conclusion:**

      Yes, Woodrow Wilson was older at the time of his death than John the Baptist.

      - Elizabeth I was born on September 7, 1533.

      - She died on March 24, 1603.

      - Therefore, she lived from 1533 to 1603, which is 69 years. Since she died
      before her birthday in 1603, she was 69 years old at the time of her death.


      Step 2: Determine the age at death of William Wallace.

      - William Wallace was born around 1270 (his exact birth year is not known, but
      1270 is a commonly accepted estimate).

      - He died on August 23, 1305.

      - So, from 1270 to 1305 is 35 years. Depending on his exact birthdate, he would
      have been around 35 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Elizabeth I: 69 years old.

      - William Wallace: ~35 years old.

      - Robert F. Kennedy was born on November 20, 1925.

      - He died on June 6, 1968.


      So, at the time of his death in June 1968, he was:

      Robert Kennedy was 42 years old when he died.


      Step 2: Determine Ferdinand Marcos''s birth and death dates.

      - Ferdinand Marcos was born on September 11, 1917.

      - He died on September 28, 1989.


      So, at the time of his death in September 1989, he had just turned:

      1989 - 1917 = 72 years old (he had turned 72 just a couple of weeks before his
      death).


      Ferdinand Marcos was 72 years old when he died.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Robert Kennedy: 42 years old

      - Ferdinand Marcos: 72 years old

      He died on December 10, 1896, which is about 1.5 months after his 63rd birthday.


      So, Alfred Nobel was 63 years old when he died.


      **Step 5: Compare their ages at death.**

      - Alfred Nobel: 63 years
