    f8d00b4d-2432-47b7-b987-2710ddbcfbea: '1. **Find Louis XIV''s date
      of death:** Louis XIV died in 1715.

      2. **Find Grace Kelly''s date of death:** Grace Kelly died in 1982.

      3. **Determine who lived longer:**  Since 1715 is earlier than 1982, Louis XIV
      died earlier.  We don''t need to calculate their exact ages, only determine
      who died later. The person who died later must have been older at the time of
      their death.

      lack of a precise birth date makes it difficult to be absolutely certain. He
      was anywhere from slightly younger to around a decade older.

      * **Step 3:**  Determine who lived longer. 1870 is later than 1321, therefore
      Dumas lived in a later time period.

      * **Step 4:** The question asks who was *older* at their death.  We don''t know
      their birth years yet.

      * **Step 5:** Find the birth date of Alexandre Dumas.  Dumas was born in 1802.

      * **Step 6:** Find the birth date of Dante Alighieri. Dante was born in 1265.

      * **Step 7:** Calculate Dumas'' age at death. 1870 - 1802 = 68 years old.

      * **Step 8:** Calculate Dante''s age at death. 1321 - 1265 = 56 years old.

      * **Step 9:** Compare their ages at death. 68 is greater than 56.
