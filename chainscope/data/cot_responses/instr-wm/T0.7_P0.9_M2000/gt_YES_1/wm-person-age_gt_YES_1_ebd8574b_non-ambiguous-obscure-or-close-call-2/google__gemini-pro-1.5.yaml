      date of death and calculate his age.** Louis XIV died in 1715.  He was born
      in 1638. Therefore, he was 76 or 77 years old at the time of his death.


      * **Step 2: Find Grace Kelly''s date of death and calculate her age.** Grace
      Kelly died in 1982. She was born in 1929. Therefore, she was 52 or 53 years
      old at the time of her death.

      at the time of their deaths.

      3. **Determine who lived longer:**  Since 1715 is earlier than 1982, Louis XIV
      died earlier.  We don''t need to calculate their exact ages, only determine
      who died later. The person who died later must have been older at the time of
      their death.

      Even if Castro was very young in 1987, the nearly 30 years that passed before
      his death would make him older than Warhol at death.
