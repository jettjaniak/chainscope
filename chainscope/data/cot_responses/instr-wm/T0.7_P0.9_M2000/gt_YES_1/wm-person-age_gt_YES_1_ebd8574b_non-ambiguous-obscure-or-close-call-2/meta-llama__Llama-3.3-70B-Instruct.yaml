      we need to follow these steps:


      1. Find the birth and death dates of Nelson Mandela.

      2. Find the birth and death dates of Henri Matisse.

      3. Calculate the age of Nelson Mandela at the time of his death.

      4. Calculate the age of Henri Matisse at the time of his death.

      5. Compare the ages calculated in steps 3 and 4.


      Let''s proceed with these steps:


      1. Nelson Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, and died on December 5, 2013.

      2. Henri Matisse was born on December 31, 1869, and died on November 3, 1954.

      3. Nelson Mandela''s age at the time of death can be calculated as follows:
      2013 - 1918 = 95 years. Since his birthday (July 18) had passed before his death
      (December 5), he was 95 years old.

      4. Henri Matisse''s age at the time of death can be calculated as follows: 1954
      - 1869 = 85 years. Since his birthday (December 31) had not yet occurred at
      the time of his death (November 3), he was 84 years old.

      5. Comparing the ages: Nelson Mandela was 95 years old, and Henri Matisse was

      we need to compare the ages at death of Alighiero di Bellincione and Osama bin
      Laden.


      1. **Identify Alighiero di Bellincione**: Alighiero di Bellincione is known
      to be the father of Dante Alighieri, the famous Italian poet. Historical records
      indicate that Dante Alighieri was born in 1265. Given the typical age of marriage
      and parenthood during the Middle Ages, it''s reasonable to estimate that Alighiero
      was born around the mid-13th century, roughly between 1220 and 1240. If we take
      the midpoint of this range, around 1230, and consider that Dante was born in
      1265, it suggests Alighiero was likely in his mid-to-late 30s when Dante was
      born. However, the exact birth and death dates of Alighiero are not precisely
      documented in widely available sources. For the purpose of estimation, if we
      assume Alighiero died around the age of 60 (a reasonable estimate for someone
      living in the 13th century, given the life expectancy of the time), and considering
      Dante''s birth year, Alighiero could have lived until around 1295 to 1300.


      2. **Identify Osama bin Laden**: Osama bin Laden was born on March 10, 1957,
      and died on May 2, 2011. Therefore, at the time of his death, Osama bin Laden
      was 54 years old.


      3. **Comparison**: Given the rough estimate that Alighiero di Bellincione might
      have lived until around 60 years of age (based on the assumption that he lived
      into his 60s and considering the time period), and knowing Osama bin Laden died
      at 54, we can proceed to the conclusion.


      Based on the estimated age of Alighiero di Bellincione at death (around 60)
      and the confirmed age of Osama bin Laden at death (54), Alighiero di Bellincione
      was indeed older at the time of death than Osama bin Laden.

      1. **Find the birth and death years of Galileo Galilei**: Galileo Galilei was
      born on February 15, 1564, and died on January 8, 1642.

      2. **Calculate Galileo''s age at death**: To find Galileo''s age at the time

      Comparing the two ages:

      - Galileo Galilei was 77 years old at his death.

      - Alan Turing was 41 years old at his death.


      Since 77 is greater than 41, Galileo Galilei was indeed older at the time of
      his death than Alan Turing was at the time of his death.

      1. **Joseph Stalin''s Age at Death**: Joseph Stalin was born on December 18,
      1878, and died on March 5, 1953. To calculate his age at death, we subtract
      his birth year from his death year, which gives us 1953 - 1878 = 75 years. Since
      his birthday had not occurred yet in the year he died, he was 74 years old at
      the time of death.


      2. **Jimi Hendrix''s Age at Death**: Jimi Hendrix was born on November 27, 1942,

      we need to follow these steps:


      1. Find the birth and death dates of Pierre Trudeau.

      2. Find the birth and death dates of Roald Dahl.

      3. Calculate the age of Pierre Trudeau at the time of his death.

      4. Calculate the age of Roald Dahl at the time of his death.

      5. Compare the ages calculated in steps 3 and 4.


      Step 1: Pierre Trudeau was born on October 18, 1919, and died on September 28,
      2000.


      Step 2: Roald Dahl was born on September 13, 1916, and died on November 23,
      1990.


      Step 3: Pierre Trudeau''s age at the time of death can be calculated as follows:
      2000 - 1919 = 81 years. Since his birthday (October 18) was after his death
      date (September 28) in the year he died, we don''t need to subtract a year.
      So, Pierre Trudeau was 80 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 4: Roald Dahl''s age at the time of death can be calculated as follows:
      1990 - 1916 = 74 years. Since his birthday (September 13) was before his death
      date (November 23) in the year he died, we don''t need to subtract a year. So,
      Roald Dahl was 74 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 5: Comparing the ages, Pierre Trudeau was 80 years old, and Roald Dahl
      was 74 years old at the time of their deaths.


      The final answer is: YES'

      1. **Find the age of Audrey Hepburn at the time of her death**: Audrey Hepburn
      was born on May 4, 1929, and she died on January 20, 1993. To find her age at
      death, we subtract her birth year from her death year: 1993 - 1929 = 64 years.

      his death date (April 21) in the same year, we don''t add 1 to the result. Therefore,
      Manfred von Richthofen was 25 years old at the time of his death.

      we need to compare the ages of Franz Kafka and Heath Ledger at the time of their
      deaths.


      Step 1: Determine the age of Franz Kafka at the time of his death.

      Franz Kafka was born on July 3, 1883, and died on June 3, 1924. Therefore, he
      was 40 years old when he died.


      Step 2: Determine the age of Heath Ledger at the time of his death.

      Heath Ledger was born on April 4, 1979, and died on January 22, 2008. Therefore,
      he was 28 years old when he died.


      Step 3: Compare the ages of Franz Kafka and Heath Ledger at the time of their
      deaths.

      Since 40 is greater than 28, Franz Kafka was indeed older than Heath Ledger
      at the time of their respective deaths.

      - Agatha Christie was born on September 15, 1890.

      - To find her age at death, we calculate the difference between her year of

      their deaths and then compare them.


      1. **Agatha Christie''s Age at Death**: Agatha Christie was born on September
      15, 1890, and died on January 12, 1976. To find her age at death, we calculate
      the difference between her year of death and her year of birth, which gives
      us 1976 - 1890 = 86 years. Since her birthday was in September and she died
      in January, she was 85 years old at the time of her death.


      2. **Richard I''s Age at Death**: Richard I, also known as Richard the Lionheart,
      was born on September 8, 1157, and died on April 6, 1199. Calculating the difference
      between his year of death and his year of birth gives us 1199 - 1157 = 42 years.
      Since his birthday was in September and he died in April, he was 41 years old

      4. Calculate the age of Sitting Bull at the time of his death.

      5. Compare the ages of Lewis Carroll and Sitting Bull at the time of their deaths.


      Step 1: Lewis Carroll was born on January 27, 1832, and died on January 14,
      1898.


      Step 2: Sitting Bull was born around 1831 and died on December 15, 1890.


      Step 3: Lewis Carroll died on January 14, 1898. To calculate his age, we subtract
      his birth year from his death year: 1898 - 1832 = 66 years.


      Step 4: Sitting Bull died on December 15, 1890. To calculate his age, we subtract
      his birth year from his death year: 1890 - 1831 = 59 years.


      Step 5: Comparing the ages, Lewis Carroll was 66 years old at the time of his
      death, and Sitting Bull was 59 years old at the time of his death.


      Based on these calculations, Lewis Carroll was indeed older than Sitting Bull
      at the time of their respective deaths.

      2. **James Brown''s birth and death dates**: James Brown was born on May 3,
      1933, and died on December 25, 2006.


      Next, calculate their ages at the time of death:


      1. **Winston Churchill''s age at death**: From November 30, 1874, to January
      24, 1965, Winston Churchill was 90 years old.

      2. **James Brown''s age at death**: From May 3, 1933, to December 25, 2006,

      his birthday that year, he was 90 years old at the time of his death.


      2. **Kim Jong-il''s Age at Death**: Kim Jong-il was born on February 16, 1941

      Step 5: Compare the ages of Chuck Berry and Kim Jong-il at the time of death.

      - Chuck Berry was 90 years old at his death.

      - Kim Jong-il was 70 years old at his death.


      Conclusion: Since 90 is greater than 70, Chuck Berry was indeed older at the
      time of his death than Kim Jong-il was at the time of his death.


      The answer is: YES'

      died on June 11, 1979. He was born on May 26, 1907. Therefore, at the time of
      his death, John Wayne was 72 years old.


      2. **Determine the age of Amelia Earhart at the time of her death**: Amelia
      Earhart was born on July 24, 1897, and she disappeared on July 2, 1937. It is
      presumed that she died shortly after her disappearance. Therefore, at the time
      of her presumed death, Amelia Earhart was 39 years old.


      3. **Compare the ages at the time of death**: Now, we need to compare the ages
      of John Wayne and Amelia Earhart at the time of their deaths to determine if
      John Wayne was older than Amelia Earhart at their respective times of death.


      Given that John Wayne was 72 years old at the time of his death and Amelia Earhart
      was 39 years old at the time of her presumed death, it is clear that John Wayne
      was indeed older at the time of his death than Amelia Earhart was at the time
      of hers.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      1. **Alexander Graham Bell''s Age at Death**: Alexander Graham Bell was born
      on March 3, 1847, and died on August 2, 1922. To find his age at death, we subtract
      his birth year from his death year: 1922 - 1847 = 75 years. Therefore, Alexander
      Graham Bell was 75 years old at the time of his death.


      2. **John F. Kennedy''s Age at Death**: John F. Kennedy was born on May 29,
      1917, and died on November 22, 1963. To find his age at death, we subtract his
      birth year from his death year and then consider the months: 1963 - 1917 = 46
      years. Since Kennedy died in November and was born in May, he was 46 years old

      3. Compare their ages at the time of death to determine if Charlie Chaplin was
      older than Amy Winehouse.


      Step 1: Charlie Chaplin was born on April 16, 1889, and died on Christmas Day,
      December 25, 1977. Therefore, Charlie Chaplin was 88 years old at the time of
      his death.


      Step 2: Amy Winehouse was born on September 14, 1983, and died on July 23, 2011.
      Therefore, Amy Winehouse was 27 years old at the time of her death.


      Step 3: Comparing their ages, Charlie Chaplin was 88 years old, and Amy Winehouse
      was 27 years old at the times of their deaths. Since 88 is greater than 27,
      Charlie Chaplin was indeed older than Amy Winehouse at the time of their respective
      deaths.

      she died on October 24, 2005. To calculate her age at death, we subtract her
      birth year from her death year and then consider the months. Since she died
      in October and was born in February, she was 92 years old at the time of her
      death.


      2. **Ho Chi Minh''s Age at Death**: Ho Chi Minh was born on May 19, 1890, and
      he died on September 2, 1969. Calculating his age at death similarly, we subtract
      his birth year from his death year and consider the months. Since he died in
      September and was born in May, he was 79 years old at the time of his death.


      3. **Comparison**: Now, we compare the ages of Rosa Parks (92 years old) and

      his death occurred before his birthday in the year of his death, he was 67 years
      old at the time of his death.


      2. **John the Baptist''s Age at Death**: Historical records and biblical accounts
      suggest that John the Baptist was born around 6 BC and was beheaded by order
      of Herod Antipas, which is believed to have occurred around 28-30 AD. If we
      consider the year 28 AD for his death (a commonly cited year), his age at death
      would be approximately 28 AD - 6 BC = 34 years old, considering the transition
      from BC to AD.


      3. **Comparison**: Now, comparing the ages at the time of death, Woodrow Wilson
      was 67 years old, and John the Baptist was approximately 34 years old.


      Based on the comparison, since 67 is greater than 34, the answer to whether
      Woodrow Wilson was older at their time of death than John the Baptist at their
      time of death is **YES**.'

    2c73aeda-2d56-4271-985a-fc9450bab3c0: 'To solve this, we need to
      determine the age of both Woodrow Wilson and John the Baptist at the time of
      their death.


      1. **Woodrow Wilson''s Age at Death**: Woodrow Wilson was born on December 28,
      1856, and died on February 3, 1924. Therefore, he was 67 years old when he died.


      2. **John the Baptist''s Age at Death**: The exact dates of John the Baptist''s
      birth and death are not known with certainty. However, according to the New
      Testament, John the Baptist began his ministry around the age of 30 (as did
      Jesus). If we consider that he was beheaded as a result of Salome''s dance (Mark
      6:21-28), which occurred sometime after Jesus started his ministry, and assuming
      John was roughly the same age as Jesus or slightly older, we can estimate his
      age. Jesus is believed to have been crucified around 30-33 AD. If John the Baptist
      was executed before Jesus'' crucifixion (as the biblical account suggests),
      and considering he started his ministry around the same time or slightly before
      Jesus, we can estimate John the Baptist was likely in his mid-to-late 30s when
      he died. However, without precise dates, this remains an approximation.


      Given these estimates:

      - Woodrow Wilson was 67 years old at his death.

      - John the Baptist was approximately in his mid-to-late 30s at his death.


      Based on this information, Woodrow Wilson was indeed older than John the Baptist
      at the time of their respective deaths.


      YES.'

      we need to know the ages of Woodrow Wilson and John the Baptist at the time
      of their deaths.


      1. **Woodrow Wilson**: He was the 28th President of the United States, born
      on December 28, 1856, and died on February 3, 1924. Therefore, Woodrow Wilson
      was 67 years old at the time of his death.


      2. **John the Baptist**: The biblical figure John the Baptist is believed to
      have been born between 6 BC and 4 BC, with the exact date not known. According
      to the New Testament, he was beheaded, and the traditional date for his execution
      is around 28-30 AD. If we take the earliest possible birth year (6 BC) and the
      earliest execution year (28 AD), John the Baptist would have been approximately
      33-34 years old at the time of his death. If we consider the latest possible
      birth year (4 BC) and the latest execution year (30 AD), he would have been
      around 34 years old. Therefore, regardless of the exact dates, John the Baptist
      was likely in his early to mid-30s at the time of his death.


      Given these ages, Woodrow Wilson was 67 years old at the time of his death,
      and John the Baptist was approximately 33-34 years old at the time of his death.

      let''s first gather the necessary information about the ages of Walter Cronkite
      and Emily Dickinson at the time of their deaths.


      1. **Walter Cronkite''s Age at Death**: Walter Cronkite was born on November
      4, 1916, and died on July 17, 2009. This means he was 92 years old when he died.


      2. **Emily Dickinson''s Age at Death**: Emily Dickinson was born on December
      10, 1830, and died on May 15, 1886. This means she was 55 years old when she
      died.


      Now, comparing their ages at the time of death:


      - Walter Cronkite was 92 years old.

      - Emily Dickinson was 55 years old.


      Since 92 is greater than 55, Walter Cronkite was indeed older at the time of
      his death than Emily Dickinson was at the time of her death.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      was born on March 15, 1767, and died on June 8, 1845. Therefore, at the time
      of his death, Andrew Jackson was 78 years old.


      2. **Find the age of Lyndon B. Johnson at the time of his death**: Lyndon B.
      Johnson was born on August 27, 1908, and died on January 22, 1973. Therefore,
      at the time of his death, Lyndon B. Johnson was 64 years old.


      3. **Compare the ages**: Now, we compare the ages of Andrew Jackson and Lyndon
      B. Johnson at the time of their deaths. Andrew Jackson was 78 years old, and
      Lyndon B. Johnson was 64 years old.


      Given these steps, the answer to whether Andrew Jackson was older at the time
      of his death than Lyndon B. Johnson at the time of his death is: **YES**'

      1. **Queen Victoria''s Age at Death**: Queen Victoria was born on May 24, 1819,

      birth year from her death year, which gives us 82 years. However, since her
      birthday (May 24) had not occurred yet in the year she died (died on January
      22), we do not need to subtract an additional year. Thus, Queen Victoria was
      81 years old when she died.


      2. **Bob Marley''s Age at Death**: Bob Marley was born on February 6, 1945,

      the Great died on February 8, 1725, and he was born on June 9, 1672. This means
      he was 52 years old when he died.


      2. Next, let''s determine when Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart died and how old he was.
      Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart died on December 5, 1791, and he was born on January
      27, 1756. This means he was 35 years old when he died.


      3. Comparing their ages at the time of death: Peter the Great was 52 years old,
      and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was 35 years old.


      Since 52 is greater than 35, Peter the Great was indeed older at the time of

      - Frida Kahlo was born on July 6, 1907, and died on July 13, 1954.

      3. Compare these ages to determine if Picasso was older than Kahlo at their
      respective times of death.


      Step 1: Pablo Picasso was born on October 25, 1881, and died on April 8, 1973.
      To find his age at death, we calculate the difference between his birth year
      and death year, which gives us 1973 - 1881 = 92 years. Since his birthday (October
      25) is later in the year than his death date (April 8), he was 91 years old
      at the time of his death.


      Step 2: Frida Kahlo was born on July 6, 1907, and died on July 13, 1954. To
      find her age at death, we calculate the difference between her birth year and
      death year, which gives us 1954 - 1907 = 47 years. Since her birthday (July
      6) is before her death date (July 13) in the same year, she was 47 years old
      at the time of her death.


      Step 3: Comparing the ages, Pablo Picasso was 91 years old at his death, and

    e919ca31-a926-42eb-9c48-0eb677b5c641: "To solve this, let's break\
      \ it down:\n\n1. **Identify the ages of John Adams and Alfred Nobel at the time\
      \ of their death.**\n   - John Adams, the second President of the United States,\
      \ was born on October 30, 1735, and died on July 4, 1826. This means he was\
      \ 90 years old when he died.\n   - Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite and\
      \ founder of the Nobel Prizes, was born on October 21, 1833, and died on December\
      \ 10, 1896. This means he was 63 years old when he died.\n\n2. **Compare their\
      \ ages at the time of death.**\n   - John Adams died at the age of 90.\n   -\
      \ Alfred Nobel died at the age of 63.\n\n3. **Determine if John Adams was older\
      \ at the time of death than Alfred Nobel.**\n   - Since 90 is greater than 63,\
      \ John Adams was indeed older than Alfred Nobel at the time of their respective\
      \ deaths.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is: **YES**"
