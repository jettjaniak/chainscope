      Step 1: Identify who Alighiero di Bellincione was.

      Alighiero di Bellincione was the father of the famous Italian poet Dante Alighieri.
      However, his exact birth and death dates are not well-documented in historical
      records.


      Step 2: Find information about Osama bin Laden''s age at death.

      Historical records about Alighiero di Bellincione are limited, but he is believed
      to have died around 1283. His birth date is even less certain, but he was likely
      born in the early 13th century. Without precise dates, it''s difficult to calculate

      bin Laden''s age at death), historical records from 13th century Florence are

      Step 2: Find out when Joseph Goebbels lived and his age at death.

      - Joseph Goebbels was born on October 29, 1897

      - He died on May 1, 1945 (by suicide at the end of World War II)

      - This makes him 47 years old at death


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - J.P. Morgan: 75 years

      - Joseph Goebbels: 47 years


      Since 75 is greater than 47, J.P. Morgan was older at his time of death than
      Joseph Goebbels was at his time of death.

      Step 1: I need to identify who Max Wilhelm Carl Weber and Charles de Gaulle
      were, and when they died.

      - Max Wilhelm Carl Weber was a Dutch zoologist and biogeographer who lived from
      1852 to 1937, making him 85 years old at death.

      - Charles de Gaulle was a French general and statesman who lived from 1890 to
      1970, making him 79 or 80 years old at death (depending on the exact dates).


      Step 2: Compare their ages at death.

      - Weber: 85 years

      - De Gaulle: 79-80 years


      Step 3: Determine who was older at death.

      - Max Weber was approximately 5-6 years older than Charles de Gaulle at their
      respective times of death.


      NO


      Wait, I need to verify my information. Let me double-check:

      - Max Wilhelm Carl Weber died at age 85 (1852-1937)

      - Charles de Gaulle died at age 80 (November 22, 1890 - November 9, 1970)


      Therefore, Weber was older at his time of death than de Gaulle.

      - He died on March 24, 2016


      Step 2: Calculate Johan Cruyff''s age at death.

      - Cruyff was 68 years old when he died (almost 69)


      Step 3: Find out when Ernest Hemingway was born and when he died.

      - Ernest Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899

      - He died on July 2, 1961


      Step 4: Calculate Ernest Hemingway''s age at death.

      - Hemingway was 61 years old when he died (just short of his 62nd birthday)


      Step 5: Compare the ages at death.

      - Johan Cruyff: 68 years

      - Ernest Hemingway: 61 years


      Since 68 is greater than 61, Johan Cruyff was older at the time of his death
      than Ernest Hemingway was at the time of his death.

      - Ernest Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899

      - He died on July 2, 1961


      Step 4: Calculate Ernest Hemingway''s age at death.

      - From July 21, 1899 to July 2, 1961

      - This is just shy of 62 years (he died a few weeks before his 62nd birthday)

      - So Ernest Hemingway was 61 years old when he died


      Step 5: Compare the two ages at death.

      - Johan Cruyff: approximately 68 years

      - Ernest Hemingway: 61 years


      Since 68 years is greater than 61 years, Johan Cruyff was older at his time
      of death than Ernest Hemingway was at his time of death.

      - George H. W. Bush was born on June 12, 1924

      - He died on November 30, 2018

      - This makes him 94 years old at death

      - He died on August 23, 634 CE

      - This makes him approximately 61 years old at death


      Step 3: Compare the ages.

      - George H. W. Bush: 94 years

      - Abu Bakr: 61 years

      - 94 is greater than 61


      Therefore, YES, George H. W. Bush was older at his time of death than Abu Bakr

      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Alexander Hamilton: 49 years old (or 47 if using the later birth year)

      - Malcolm X: 39 years old

      - Either way, Hamilton was older at the time of death


      NO, Alexander Hamilton was not younger than Malcolm X at their time of death.
      Hamilton was approximately 49 years old at death, while Malcolm X was 39 years
      old.


      Wait, I need to be careful with the question wording. The question asks if Hamilton
      was OLDER than Malcolm X at death.


      Since Hamilton (49) was older than Malcolm X (39) at their respective times
      of death, the answer is:


      YES'

      Step 1: Determine when Alexander Hamilton died and at what age.

      - Alexander Hamilton was born on January 11, 1755 (or 1757, but most historians
      accept 1755)

      - He died on July 12, 1804, after being shot in a duel with Aaron Burr

      - At his death, Hamilton was 49 years old


      Step 2: Determine when Malcolm X died and at what age.

      - Malcolm X was born on May 19, 1925, as Malcolm Little

      - He was assassinated on February 21, 1965

      - At his death, Malcolm X was 39 years old


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - Alexander Hamilton: 49 years old

      - Malcolm X: 39 years old


      Since 49 is greater than 39, Alexander Hamilton was older at the time of his
      death than Malcolm X was at the time of his death.


      NO


      Wait, I made a mistake in my answer. The question asks if Hamilton was older
      than Malcolm X at their respective deaths, and since 49 is greater than 39,
      the correct answer is:


      YES'

      - He died on July 12, 1804 after being shot in a duel with Aaron Burr


      Step 2: Calculate Alexander Hamilton''s age at death.

      - Hamilton was 49 years old when he died (1804 - 1755 = 49)


      Step 3: Determine when Malcolm X was born and when he died.

      - Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little on May 19, 1925

      - He was assassinated on February 21, 1965


      Step 4: Calculate Malcolm X''s age at death.

      - Malcolm X was 39 years old when he died (1965 - 1925 = 39, and he died before

      Step 2: Find Alfred Nobel''s lifespan.

      - Alfred Nobel was born on October 21, 1833

      - He died on December 10, 1896

      - This means he lived to be 63 years old


      Step 3: Compare their ages at death.

      - John Adams: 90 years

      - Alfred Nobel: 63 years

      - 90 is greater than 63
