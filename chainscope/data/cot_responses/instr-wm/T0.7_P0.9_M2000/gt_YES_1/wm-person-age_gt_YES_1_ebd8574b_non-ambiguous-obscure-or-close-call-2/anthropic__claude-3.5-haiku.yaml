      - Died: January 22, 2008

      - Age at death: 28 years old


      3. Comparing their ages at death:

      - Kafka died at 40 years old

      - Ledger died at 28 years old

      - 40 is greater than 28


      Therefore, Franz Kafka was older at the time of his death than Heath Ledger.

      1. First, I''ll find Johan Cruyff''s age at death:

      - Johan Cruyff was born on 25 April 1947

      - He died on 24 March 2016

      - At his death, he was 68 years old


      2. Next, I''ll find Ernest Hemingway''s age at death:

      - Ernest Hemingway was born on 21 July 1899

      - He died on 2 July 1961

      - At his death, he was 61 years old

    95c2ffc3-64b0-405a-a277-d0cf63e7e4ff: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Leo Tolstoy''s lifespan:

      - Born: September 9, 1828

      - Died: November 20, 1910

      - Age at death: 82 years old


      2. Duke Ellington''s lifespan:

      - Born: April 29, 1899

      - Died: May 24, 1974

      - Age at death: 75 years old
