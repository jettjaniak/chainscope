      - Born: February 12, 1809

      - Died: April 15, 1865

      - Age at death: 56 years old

      - Born: November 7, 1728

      - Died: February 14, 1779

      - Age at death: 50 years old


      3. Now I can compare their ages at death:

      - 56 is greater than 50

      1. First, let me find out when John Adams lived and died:

      - Born: October 30, 1735

      - Died: July 4, 1826

      - Age at death: 90 years, 8 months


      2. Next, let me find out when Alfred Nobel lived and died:

      - Born: October 21, 1833

      - Died: December 10, 1896

      - Age at death: 63 years, 1 month


      3. Now I can compare their ages at death:

      - John Adams: 90 years, 8 months

      - Alfred Nobel: 63 years, 1 month

      - 90 years is clearly greater than 63 years
