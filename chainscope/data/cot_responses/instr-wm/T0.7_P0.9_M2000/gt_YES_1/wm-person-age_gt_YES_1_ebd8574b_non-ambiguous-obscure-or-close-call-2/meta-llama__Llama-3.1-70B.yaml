      we need to follow these steps:


      1. Determine the birth and death dates of Mahatma Gandhi.

      2. Determine the birth and death dates of Robert F. Kennedy.

      3. Calculate their ages at the time of death.

      4. Compare the ages to determine if Mahatma Gandhi was older than Robert F.
      Kennedy at the time of their deaths.


      Step 1: Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, and died on January 30,
      1948.


      Step 2: Robert F. Kennedy was born on November 20, 1925, and died on June 6,
      1968.


      Step 3: Calculating their ages at the time of death:


      - Mahatma Gandhi''s age at death: 1948 - 1869 = 78 years old.

      - Robert F. Kennedy''s age at death: 1968 - 1925 = 42 years old.

      2. Find the birth and death dates of Alan Turing.

      3. Calculate the age of each at the time of death.

      4. Compare the ages to determine the answer.


      Step 1: Galileo Galilei''s birth and death dates.

      - Galileo Galilei was born on February 15, 1564.

      - Galileo Galilei died on January 8, 1642.


      Step 2: Alan Turing''s birth and death dates.

      - Alan Turing was born on June 23, 1912.

      - Alan Turing died on June 7, 1954.


      Step 3: Calculate the age of each at the time of death.

      - Galileo Galilei''s age at death: 1642 - 1564 = 77 years old.

      - Alan Turing''s age at death: 1954 - 1912 = 41 years old.

    1193e7cd-5ccb-4034-9366-daba116d416d: '<think></think>To answer this question,
      we need to follow these steps:


      1. Determine the age of Audrey Hepburn at the time of her death.

      2. Determine the age of Manfred von Richthofen at the time of his death.

      3. Compare the two ages to determine if Audrey Hepburn was older than Manfred
      von Richthofen at their respective times of death.


      Step 1: Audrey Hepburn was born on May 4, 1929, and died on January 20, 1993.
      Therefore, she was 63 years old at the time of her death.


      Step 2: Manfred von Richthofen, also known as the Red Baron, was born on May
      2, 1892, and died on April 21, 1918. Therefore, he was 25 years old at the time
      of his death.


      Step 3: Comparing the ages, 63 (Audrey Hepburn''s age at death) is greater than
      25 (Manfred von Richthofen''s age at death).


      Based on this comparison, the answer to the question is: YES.

      - Richard I died on April 6, 1199.


      Step 3: Calculate the age of each at the time of death.

      - Agatha Christie''s age at death: 1976 - 1890 = 85 years old.

      - Richard I''s age at death: 1199 - 1157 = 41 years old.


      Step 4: Compare the ages.

      - Agatha Christie was 85 years old at the time of death.

      - Richard I was 41 years old at the time of death.


      Since 85 is greater than 41, Agatha Christie was indeed older at the time of
      death than Richard I.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'

      2. Determine the birth and death years of Lee Harvey Oswald.

      3. Calculate the age of each at the time of death.

      4. Compare the ages to determine if Hans Christian Andersen was older.


      Step 1: Hans Christian Andersen''s birth and death years.

      - Hans Christian Andersen was born on April 2, 1805.

      - He died on August 4, 1875.


      Step 2: Lee Harvey Oswald''s birth and death years.

      - Lee Harvey Oswald was born on October 18, 1939.

      - He died on November 24, 1963.


      Step 3: Calculate the age of each at the time of death.

      - Hans Christian Andersen''s age at death: 1875 - 1805 = 70 years old.

      - Lee Harvey Oswald''s age at death: 1963 - 1939 = 24 years old.


      Step 4: Compare the ages.

      - Hans Christian Andersen was 70 years old at the time of his death.

      - Lee Harvey Oswald was 24 years old at the time of his death.


      Since 70 is greater than 24, Hans Christian Andersen was indeed older at the
      time of his death than Lee Harvey Oswald.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'

      1882. Therefore, he was 73 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 2: John Lennon was born on October 9, 1940, and died on December 8, 1980.
      Therefore, he was 40 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 3: Comparing the ages, 73 (Charles Darwin''s age at death) is greater than
      40 (John Lennon''s age at death).


      Based on this comparison, the answer to the question is: YES.

      Darwin was older at the time of death than John Lennon, we need to follow these
      steps:


      1. Find the birth and death years of Charles Darwin.

      2. Find the birth and death years of John Lennon.

      3. Calculate the age of each at the time of death.

      4. Compare these ages to answer the question.


      Step 1: Charles Darwin''s birth and death years.

      - Charles Darwin was born on February 12, 1809.

      - Charles Darwin died on April 19, 1882.


      Step 2: John Lennon''s birth and death years.

      - John Lennon was born on October 9, 1940.

      - John Lennon died on December 8, 1980.


      Step 3: Calculate the age of each at the time of death.

      - Charles Darwin''s age at death: 1882 - 1809 = 72 years old.

      - John Lennon''s age at death: 1980 - 1940 = 40 years old.


      Step 4: Compare the ages.

      - Charles Darwin was 72 years old at the time of death.

      - John Lennon was 40 years old at the time of death.


      Since 72 is greater than 40, Charles Darwin was indeed older at the time of
      death than John Lennon.

      1. Find the birth and death dates of Akira Kurosawa and William Shakespeare.

      2. Calculate the age of each at the time of death.

      3. Compare the ages to determine if Akira Kurosawa was older at the time of
      death than William Shakespeare.


      Step 1: Akira Kurosawa was born on March 23, 1910, and died on September 6,

      1. Find the birth and death dates of Alexandre Dumas.

      2. Find the birth and death dates of Dante Alighieri.

      3. Calculate the age of each at the time of death.

      4. Compare the ages to determine if Alexandre Dumas was older.


      Step 1: Alexandre Dumas was born on July 24, 1802, and died on December 5, 1870.


      Step 2: Dante Alighieri was born on May 29, 1265, and died on September 14,
      1321.


      Step 3: Calculating the age of each at the time of death:

      - Alexandre Dumas was 68 years old at the time of his death.

      - Dante Alighieri was 56 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 4: Comparing the ages, 68 (Alexandre Dumas'' age) is greater than 56 (Dante
      Alighieri''s age).


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.

      2. Calculate the age of each person at the time of their death.

      3. Compare the ages and determine whether Alexandre Dumas was older than Dante
      Alighieri at their respective times of death.


      Step 1: Alexandre Dumas was born on July 24, 1802, and died on December 5, 1870.
      Dante Alighieri was born in 1265 and died in 1321. However, the exact dates
      of his birth and death are unknown.


      Step 2: Since the exact dates of Dante Alighieri''s birth and death are unknown,
      we cannot calculate his age at the time of his death. Therefore, we can only
      compare the age of Alexandre Dumas.


      Step 3: Alexandre Dumas was 68 years old at the time of his death. Without knowing
      Dante Alighieri''s age at the time of his death, we cannot determine whether
      Alexandre Dumas was older or younger.

      Step 1: Alfred Hitchcock was born on August 13, 1899, and died on April 29,
      1980. Francis of Assisi was born on September 26, 1181, and died on October
      3, 1226.


      Step 2: At the time of his death, Alfred Hitchcock was 80 years old (1980 -
      1899). At the time of his death, Francis of Assisi was 45 years old (1226 -
      1181).


      Step 3: Comparing the ages, 80 (Alfred Hitchcock''s age) is greater than 45
      (Francis of Assisi''s age).


      Therefore, the answer to the question is: YES

      **Francis of Assisi:**

      - Born: c. 1181

      - Died: October 3, 1226


      **Calculating ages at the time of death:**

      - Alfred Hitchcock''s age: 1980 - 1899 = 80 years old

      - Francis of Assisi''s age: 1226 - 1181 = 45 years old


      **Comparing ages:**

      - Alfred Hitchcock was 80 years old at the time of his death.

      - Francis of Assisi was 45 years old at the time of his death.

      Step 2: Vasco da Gama''s age at death: 1524 - 1460 = 64 years. Che Guevara''s
      age at death: 1967 - 1928 = 39 years.


      Step 3: Comparing the ages, Vasco da Gama was 64 years old at his time of death,
      while Che Guevara was 39 years old. Therefore, Vasco da Gama was indeed older

      2. Determine the birth and death years of Che Guevara.

      3. Calculate the age of each at the time of death.

      4. Compare these ages to answer the question.


      Step 1: Vasco da Gama''s birth and death years.

      - Vasco da Gama was born in 1460 or 1469 (sources vary).

      - Vasco da Gama died on December 24, 1524.


      Step 2: Che Guevara''s birth and death years.

      - Che Guevara was born on June 14, 1928.

      - Che Guevara died on October 9, 1967.


      Step 3: Calculate the age of each at the time of death.

      - Vasco da Gama''s age at death: 1524 - 1460/1469 = 64/65 years old.

      - Che Guevara''s age at death: 1967 - 1928 = 39 years old.


      Step 4: Compare the ages.

      - Vasco da Gama was approximately 64/65 years old at the time of death.

      - Che Guevara was 39 years old at the time of death.


      Since 64/65 is greater than 39, Vasco da Gama was indeed older at the time of
      death than Che Guevara.

      we need to follow these steps:


      1. Find the age of Little Richard at the time of his death.

      2. Find the age of Idi Amin at the time of his death.

      3. Compare the ages to determine if Little Richard was older than Idi Amin at
      their respective times of death.


      Step 1: Little Richard was born on December 5, 1932, and died on May 9, 2020.
      Therefore, he was 87 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 2: Idi Amin was born on c. 1923-1928 (exact birthdate unknown) and died
      on August 16, 2003. Assuming his birthdate to be around 1925, he would have
      been approximately 78 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 3: Comparing the ages, 87 (Little Richard''s age at death) is greater than
      78 (Idi Amin''s estimated age at death).


      Based on this comparison, the answer to the question is: YES.

      need to follow these steps:


      1. Determine the birth and death years of Louis Pasteur.

      2. Determine the birth and death years of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.

      3. Calculate the age of each at the time of death.

      4. Compare the ages to answer the question.


      Step 1: Louis Pasteur''s birth and death years.

      - Louis Pasteur was born on December 27, 1822.

      - He died on September 28, 1895.


      Step 2: Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky''s birth and death years.

      - Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was born on May 7, 1840.

      - He died on November 6, 1893.


      Step 3: Calculate the age of each at the time of death.

      - Louis Pasteur''s age at death: 1895 - 1822 = 73 years old (considering the
      months, he was 72 years and approximately 9 months old).

      - Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky''s age at death: 1893 - 1840 = 53 years old (considering
      the months, he was 53 years and approximately 5 months old).


      Step 4: Compare the ages.

      - Louis Pasteur was 73 years old at the time of death.

      - Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was 53 years old at the time of death.


      Since 73 is greater than 53, Louis Pasteur was indeed older at the time of death
      than Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.

      1. Find the birth and death dates of Queen Victoria and Bob Marley.

      2. Calculate their ages at the time of death.

      3. Compare their ages and determine the answer.


      Step 1: Find the birth and death dates.

      - Queen Victoria: Born on May 24, 1819, and died on January 22, 1901.

      - Bob Marley: Born on February 6, 1945, and died on May 11, 1981.


      Step 2: Calculate their ages at the time of death.

      - Queen Victoria''s age at death: January 22, 1901 - May 24, 1819 = 81 years,
      7 months, and 29 days (approx.).

      - Bob Marley''s age at death: May 11, 1981 - February 6, 1945 = 36 years, 3
      months, and 5 days (approx.).


      Step 3: Compare their ages.

      - Queen Victoria was 81 years old at the time of her death.

      - Bob Marley was 36 years old at the time of his death.


      Since 81 is greater than 36, we can conclude that Queen Victoria was indeed
      older at the time of her death than Bob Marley at the time of his death.

      Victor Hugo:

      - Birth date: February 26, 1802

      - Death date: May 22, 1885


      Martin Luther King Jr.:

      - Birth date: January 15, 1929

      - Death date: April 4, 1968


      Now, let''s calculate their ages at the time of their deaths.


      Victor Hugo:

      - Age at death: May 22, 1885 - February 26, 1802 = 83 years old


      Martin Luther King Jr.:

      - Age at death: April 4, 1968 - January 15, 1929 = 39 years old


      Finally, let''s compare their ages to determine if Victor Hugo was older.


      Victor Hugo''s age at death: 83 years old

      Martin Luther King Jr.''s age at death: 39 years old


      Since 83 is greater than 39, Victor Hugo was indeed older at the time of his

      3. Compare the ages to determine if Karl Marx was older than Jane Austen at
      the time of their deaths.


      Step 1: Karl Marx was born on May 5, 1818, and died on March 14, 1883. Jane
      Austen was born on December 16, 1775, and died on July 18, 1817.


      Step 2: Karl Marx''s age at the time of his death: 1883 - 1818 = 64 years old.
      Jane Austen''s age at the time of her death: 1817 - 1775 = 41 years old.


      Step 3: Comparing the ages, 64 (Karl Marx''s age) is greater than 41 (Jane Austen''s
      age).


      Based on this comparison, the answer to the question is: YES.

      we need to follow these steps:


      1. Determine the age of Henry Ford at the time of his death.

      2. Determine the age of Jesse Owens at the time of his death.

      3. Compare the ages to determine if Henry Ford was older than Jesse Owens at
      the time of their respective deaths.


      Step 1: Henry Ford was born on July 30, 1863, and died on April 7, 1947. Therefore,
      he was 83 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 2: Jesse Owens was born on September 12, 1913, and died on March 31, 1980.

      Jung was older at the time of death than C. S. Lewis, we need to follow these
      steps:


      1. Determine the birth and death years of Carl Jung.

      2. Determine the birth and death years of C. S. Lewis.

      3. Calculate the age of each at the time of death.

      4. Compare these ages to answer the question.


      Step 1: Carl Jung''s birth and death years.

      - Carl Jung was born on July 26, 1875.

      - Carl Jung died on June 6, 1961.


      Step 2: C. S. Lewis''s birth and death years.

      - C. S. Lewis was born on November 29, 1898.

      - C. S. Lewis died on November 22, 1963.


      Step 3: Calculate the age of each at the time of death.

      - Carl Jung''s age at death: 1961 - 1875 = 85 years old.

      - C. S. Lewis''s age at death: 1963 - 1898 = 64 years old.


      Step 4: Compare the ages.

      - Carl Jung was 85 years old at the time of death.

      - C. S. Lewis was 64 years old at the time of death.


      Since 85 is greater than 64, Carl Jung was indeed older at the time of death
      than C. S. Lewis.

      - Terry Pratchett was 67 years old at the time of his death.


      Since 78 is greater than 67, we can conclude that Pierre-Auguste Renoir was
      indeed older at the time of his death than Terry Pratchett.
