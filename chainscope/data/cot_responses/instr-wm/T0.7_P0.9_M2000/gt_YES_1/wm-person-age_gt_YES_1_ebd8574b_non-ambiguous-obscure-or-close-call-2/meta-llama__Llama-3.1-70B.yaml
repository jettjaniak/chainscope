      Step 1: Birth and death dates of Ella Fitzgerald and Ferdinand Magellan

      - Ella Fitzgerald was born on April 25, 1917, and died on June 15, 1996.

      - Ferdinand Magellan was born on October 27, 1480, and died on April 27, 1521.


      Step 2: Calculate their ages at the time of death

      - Ella Fitzgerald''s age at death: June 15, 1996 - April 25, 1917 = 79 years
      old

      - Ferdinand Magellan''s age at death: April 27, 1521 - October 27, 1480 = 40
      years old


      Step 3: Compare the ages

      - Ella Fitzgerald''s age at death: 79 years old

      - Ferdinand Magellan''s age at death: 40 years old


      Since 79 is greater than 40, Ella Fitzgerald was indeed older at the time of
      her death than Ferdinand Magellan.

      Step 1: Find the birth and death dates.

      - Agatha Christie was born on September 15, 1890, and died on January 12, 1976.

      - Richard I was born on September 8, 1157, and died on April 6, 1199.


      Step 2: Calculate the age of each at the time of death.

      - Agatha Christie''s age at death: 1976 - 1890 = 85 years old.

      - Richard I''s age at death: 1199 - 1157 = 41 years old.


      Step 3: Compare their ages at the time of death.

      - Agatha Christie was 85 years old at the time of her death.

      - Richard I was 41 years old at the time of his death.


      Since 85 is greater than 41, Agatha Christie was indeed older at the time of
      her death than Richard I at the time of his death.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      - Humphrey Bogart was born on December 25, 1899, and died on January 14, 1957.

      - Diana, Princess of Wales was born on July 1, 1961, and died on August 31,
      1997.


      Step 2: Calculate the age at death

      - Humphrey Bogart''s age at death: 1957 - 1899 = 57 years

      - Diana, Princess of Wales'' age at death: 1997 - 1961 = 36 years


      Step 3: Compare the ages

      - Humphrey Bogart''s age at death: 57 years

      - Diana, Princess of Wales'' age at death: 36 years


      Since 57 is greater than 36, Humphrey Bogart was indeed older at the time of
      his death than Diana, Princess of Wales.

      3. Compare the ages to determine if Lewis Carroll was older at the time of his
      death.


      Step 1: Lewis Carroll was born on January 27, 1832, and died on January 14,
      1898. Therefore, he was 65 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 2: Sitting Bull was born around 1831 and died on December 15, 1890. Therefore,
      he was approximately 59 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 3: Comparing the ages, 65 (Lewis Carroll''s age at death) is greater than
      59 (Sitting Bull''s approximate age at death).


      Based on this comparison, the answer to the question is: YES.

      Step 2: James Cook was born on November 7, 1728, and died on February 14, 1779.
      Therefore, he was 50 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 3: Comparing the ages, 56 (Abraham Lincoln''s age at death) is greater
      than 50 (James Cook''s age at death).


      Based on this comparison, the answer to the question is: YES.

      1. Find the birth and death dates for Oskar Schindler and Vincent van Gogh.

      2. Calculate the age of each person at the time of their death.

      3. Compare the ages to determine if Oskar Schindler was older at the time of
      his death than Vincent van Gogh.


      Step 1: Birth and death dates

      - Oskar Schindler: Born on April 28, 1908, and died on October 9, 1974.

      - Vincent van Gogh: Born on March 30, 1853, and died on July 29, 1890.


      Step 2: Calculating the age at the time of death

      - Oskar Schindler''s age at death: October 9, 1974 - April 28, 1908 = 66 years
      and 5 months.

      - Vincent van Gogh''s age at death: July 29, 1890 - March 30, 1853 = 37 years
      and 4 months.


      Step 3: Comparing the ages

      - Oskar Schindler''s age at death: 66 years and 5 months.

      - Vincent van Gogh''s age at death: 37 years and 4 months.

      - Since 66 years and 5 months is greater than 37 years and 4 months, we can
      conclude that Oskar Schindler was indeed older at the time of his death than
      Vincent van Gogh.

      Step 1: George H. W. Bush was born on June 12, 1924, and died on November 30,
      2018. Therefore, he was 94 years old at the time of his death.


      Step 2: Abu Bakr was born around 573 CE and died in 634 CE. The exact date of
      his birth is not known, but we can estimate his age at death. Assuming he was
      born in 573 CE and died in 634 CE, he would have been around 61 years old at
      the time of his death.


      Step 3: Comparing the ages, 94 (George H. W. Bush''s age at death) is greater
      than 61 (Abu Bakr''s estimated age at death).


      Based on this comparison, the answer to the question is: YES.

      Therefore, at the time of her death, she was 87 years old.


      Step 2: John Lewis was born on February 21, 1940, and died on July 17, 2020.
      Therefore, at the time of his death, he was 80 years old.


      Step 3: Comparing the two ages, we see that Coco Chanel was 87 years old at
      the time of her death, while John Lewis was 80 years old at the time of his
      death. Since 87 is greater than 80, we can conclude that Coco Chanel was indeed
      older at the time of her death than John Lewis at the time of his death.

      1. Find the birth and death dates for Alexander Hamilton.

      2. Find the birth and death dates for Malcolm X.

      3. Calculate the age of each at the time of their death.

      4. Compare the ages to determine if Alexander Hamilton was older.


      Step 1: Alexander Hamilton was born on January 11, 1755, and died on July 12,
      1804.


      Step 2: Malcolm X was born on May 19, 1925, and died on February 21, 1965.


      Step 3: Alexander Hamilton''s age at death: 1804 - 1755 = 49 years old.

      Malcolm X''s age at death: 1965 - 1925 = 39 years old.


      Step 4: Comparing the ages, Alexander Hamilton was indeed older at the time
      of his death than Malcolm X was at the time of his death.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'

      4. Compare the ages to determine if A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was older than Isaac
      Asimov at their respective times of death.


      Step 1: A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was born on October 15, 1931, and died on July
      27, 2015.


      Step 2: Isaac Asimov was born on January 2, 1920, and died on April 6, 1992.


      Step 3: Calculating the age at the time of death:

      - A. P. J. Abdul Kalam: 2015 - 1931 = 84 years old

      - Isaac Asimov: 1992 - 1920 = 72 years old


      Step 4: Comparing the ages:

      - A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was 84 years old at the time of his death.

      - Isaac Asimov was 72 years old at the time of his death.


      Since 84 is greater than 72, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was indeed older at the time
      of his death than Isaac Asimov.


      The answer is: YES

      King was older at the time of death than H. G. Wells, we need to follow these
      steps:


      1. Determine the birth and death years of Larry King.

      2. Determine the birth and death years of H. G. Wells.

      3. Calculate the age of each at the time of death.

      4. Compare these ages to answer the question.


      Step 1: Larry King''s birth and death years.

      - Larry King was born on November 19, 1933.

      - Larry King died on January 23, 2021.


      Step 2: H. G. Wells'' birth and death years.

      - H. G. Wells was born on September 21, 1866.

      - H. G. Wells died on August 13, 1946.


      Step 3: Calculate the age of each at the time of death.

      - Larry King''s age at death: 2021 - 1933 = 87 years old (considering the months,
      he was 87 years and approximately 2 months old).

      - H. G. Wells'' age at death: 1946 - 1866 = 80 years old (considering the months,
      he was 80 years and approximately 11 months old).


      Step 4: Compare the ages.

      - Larry King was 87 years old at the time of death.

      - H. G. Wells was 80 years old at the time of death.


      Since 87 is greater than 80, Larry King was indeed older at the time of death
      than H. G. Wells.

      Gandhi was older at the time of death than Friedrich Nietzsche, we need to follow
      these steps:


      1. Find the birth and death dates of both Indira Gandhi and Friedrich Nietzsche.

      2. Calculate their respective ages at the time of death.

      3. Compare the ages and determine if Indira Gandhi was older than Friedrich
      Nietzsche at the time of their deaths.


      Step 1: Birth and death dates

      - Indira Gandhi: Born on November 19, 1917, and died on October 31, 1984.

      - Friedrich Nietzsche: Born on October 15, 1844, and died on August 25, 1900.


      Step 2: Calculating ages at the time of death

      - Indira Gandhi: 1984 - 1917 = 66 years and 11 months.

      - Friedrich Nietzsche: 1900 - 1844 = 55 years and 10 months.


      Step 3: Comparing the ages

      - Indira Gandhi was 66 years and 11 months old at the time of her death.

      - Friedrich Nietzsche was 55 years and 10 months old at the time of his death.


      Since 66 years and 11 months (Indira Gandhi''s age at death) is greater than
      55 years and 10 months (Friedrich Nietzsche''s age at death), we can conclude
      that Indira Gandhi was indeed older at the time of her death than Friedrich
      Nietzsche at the time of his death.

      1. Find the birth and death dates for both Pablo Picasso and Frida Kahlo.

      2. Calculate their ages at the time of death.

      3. Compare the ages to determine if Pablo Picasso was older.


      Step 1: Birth and Death Dates

      - Pablo Picasso was born on October 25, 1881, and died on April 8, 1973.

      - Frida Kahlo was born on July 6, 1907, and died on July 13, 1954.


      Step 2: Calculating Ages

      - Pablo Picasso''s age at death: April 8, 1973 - October 25, 1881 = 91 years,
      5 months, and 13 days.

      - Frida Kahlo''s age at death: July 13, 1954 - July 6, 1907 = 47 years and 7
      days.


      Step 3: Comparing Ages

      - Pablo Picasso was 91 years, 5 months, and 13 days old at the time of his death.

      - Frida Kahlo was 47 years and 7 days old at the time of her death.

      - Therefore, Pablo Picasso was indeed older at the time of his death than Frida
      Kahlo at the time of her death.


      The answer is: YES.

      we need to follow these steps:


      1. Find the birth and death dates of John Adams and Alfred Nobel.

      2. Calculate the age of each person at the time of their death.

      3. Compare the ages to determine if John Adams was older than Alfred Nobel at
      the time of their respective deaths.


      Step 1: John Adams was born on October 30, 1735, and died on July 4, 1826.

      Alfred Nobel was born on October 21, 1833, and died on December 10, 1896.


      Step 2: John Adams was 90 years old at the time of his death (1826 - 1735 =
      91 years, but we subtract 1 year as he was born in October and died in July,
      so he didn''t live to see his 91st birthday).

      Alfred Nobel was 63 years old at the time of his death (1896 - 1833 = 63 years).


      Step 3: Comparing the ages, John Adams was 90 years old and Alfred Nobel was
      63 years old at their respective times of death. Therefore, John Adams was older
      than Alfred Nobel at the time of their deaths.


      The answer to the question is: YES.
