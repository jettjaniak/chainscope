      the following steps:


      1. **Determine the area of Miami-Dade County, Florida**: Miami-Dade County is
      one of the largest counties in the state of Florida by area. It covers approximately
      2,431 square miles (6,296 square kilometers).


      2. **Determine the area of Central Athens (regional unit)**: Central Athens
      is a regional unit of Greece, part of the Attica region. It is significantly
      smaller than Miami-Dade County, with an area of approximately 87 square kilometers
      (about 34 square miles).


      3. **Compare the two areas**: Miami-Dade County''s area (6,296 square kilometers)
      is substantially larger than that of Central Athens (87 square kilometers).
