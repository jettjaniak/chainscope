    00ac6492-2b70-4c79-a1a4-3112649109c3: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s find the area of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi:

      - The Emirate of Abu Dhabi covers approximately 67,340 square kilometers (about
      26,000 square miles)


      2. Next, let''s find the area of San Diego:

      - San Diego city covers approximately 842 square kilometers (about 325 square
      miles)

      - San Diego County covers about 4,421 square kilometers (about 1,707 square
      miles)


      3. Comparing the areas:

      - Even if we use the larger San Diego County area (4,421 sq km), it is much
      smaller than the Emirate of Abu Dhabi''s 67,340 sq km


      4. Conclusion:

      The Emirate of Abu Dhabi is significantly larger than San Diego.

    fb3c916b-eba4-4397-8ef2-809995539e75: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, River Nile is not a state. The Nile is a river that flows through
      several countries in northeastern Africa, primarily Egypt and Sudan.


      2. Capri is an island located in the Tyrrhenian Sea, off the Sorrentine Peninsula,
      on the south side of the Gulf of Naples in the Campania region of Italy.


      3. Since River Nile is not a state and cannot have an area in the way a geographical
      region would, we cannot compare its "area" to Capri''s area.


      4. Therefore, the question as stated is not meaningful or answerable.


      However, if the question was asking about comparing the area of the Nile River
      basin to the area of Capri island, that would be a different matter. The Nile
      River basin covers approximately 3,254,555 square kilometers, which is vastly
      larger than Capri, which is only about 10.4 square kilometers.


      But based strictly on the wording of the original question:


      NO.'

      The reasoning is that the premise of the question is fundamentally flawed, as
      "River Nile (state)" is not a valid geographical entity.'
