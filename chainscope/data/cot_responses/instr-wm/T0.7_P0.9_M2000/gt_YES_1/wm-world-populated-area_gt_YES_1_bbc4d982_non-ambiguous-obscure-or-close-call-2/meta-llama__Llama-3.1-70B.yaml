      Brussels:


      1. **Find the area of Catalonia**: Catalonia is an autonomous community in northeastern
      Spain. Its area is approximately 32,114 square kilometers (12,399 sq mi).


      2. **Find the area of Brussels**: Brussels, the capital of Belgium, is a region

      (1,303 square kilometers).


      2. **Find the area of Inner London**: Inner London is the central part of London,
      England, United Kingdom. It consists of 13 boroughs and covers an area of approximately
      120 square miles (310 square kilometers).


      3. **Compare the areas**: Now, we compare the area of Los Angeles (approximately
      503 square miles) with the area of Inner London (approximately 120 square miles).


      Given that 503 square miles is greater than 120 square miles, we can conclude
      that Los Angeles indeed has a larger area than Inner London.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'
