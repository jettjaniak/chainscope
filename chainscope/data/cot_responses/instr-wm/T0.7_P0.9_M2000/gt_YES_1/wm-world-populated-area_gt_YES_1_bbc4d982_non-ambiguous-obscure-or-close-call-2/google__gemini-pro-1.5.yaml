      asks about area, so we need to compare the areas of Abu Dhabi and San Diego.

      * **Step 2:** We need to find the area of Abu Dhabi and San Diego.  A quick
      search shows Abu Dhabi''s area is roughly 67,340 sq km. San Diego''s area is
      roughly 1,000 sq km (including water, it''s about 4,500 sq km, still significantly
      smaller).

      * **Step 3:** 67,340 sq km is larger than 1,000 sq km (and also larger than
      4,500 sq km).

      places:** Emirate of Abu Dhabi is a political entity (an emirate within the
      UAE), and San Diego can refer to either the city or the county.  To make a meaningful
      comparison, we should compare like entities. Let''s assume we are comparing
      the Emirate of Abu Dhabi to San Diego County, as that''s a more comparable political
      unit.


      2. **Find the areas:**  We need to find the area of both Abu Dhabi Emirate and
      San Diego County.


      3. **Compare the areas:** Once we have the areas, we can compare them to determine
      which is larger.


      According to external sources, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi covers approximately
      67,340 square kilometers. San Diego County covers approximately 11,721 square
      kilometers.


      Therefore, Abu Dhabi is significantly larger.

      we need to convert San Diego''s area to square kilometers as well.  1 square
      mile is approximately 2.59 square kilometers. Therefore, San Diego is about
      1096 * 2.59 = 2838.64 square kilometers.

      or the historical, undivided Punjab.  Since the question doesn''t specify, let''s
      assume it refers to the larger Indian Punjab.

      area."  This means physical size, not population or economic output.


      * **Step 3: Find data on the areas.**  We need to look up the land area of both
      Houston and Shinjuku.
