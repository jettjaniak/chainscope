      1. Identify the locations corresponding to the ZIP codes.

      2. Find their geographic coordinates (specifically latitude).

      3. Compare the latitudes to determine which one is farther north.


      **Step 1: Identify the locations**

      - ZIP code 11976 corresponds to Water Mill, New York, which is on Long Island.

      - ZIP code 94027 corresponds to Atherton, California, located in the San Francisco
      Bay Area.


      **Step 2: Find the latitudes**

      - Water Mill, NY (11976) has an approximate latitude of 40.924 degrees North.

      - Atherton, CA (94027) has an approximate latitude of 37.461 degrees North.
