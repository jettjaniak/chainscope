      1. **10011, NY** - This zip code is in Manhattan, New York City, which is located
      in the northeastern United States.


      2. **90069, CA** - This zip code is in West Hollywood, California, which is
      located on the west coast of the United States.


      3. **Latitude Comparison** - Latitude lines run horizontally around the globe.
      Locations with higher latitude numbers are further north. Manhattan, NY, is
      generally located at a higher latitude than West Hollywood, CA.


      Therefore, 10011, NY is located north of 90069, CA.
