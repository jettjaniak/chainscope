      NY is located north of 90291, CA.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of these zip codes.

      - 10013 is a zip code in New York City, specifically in lower Manhattan, New
      York.

      - 90291 is a zip code in Venice, Los Angeles, California.


      Step 2: Consider the approximate latitudes of these locations.

      - New York City is located on the east coast at approximately 40-41 degrees
      north latitude.

      - Venice, Los Angeles is located on the west coast at approximately 33-34 degrees
      north latitude.


      Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

      - New York City (including zip code 10013) is at a higher latitude (further
      north) than Venice, Los Angeles (including zip code 90291).

      - The difference is roughly 6-7 degrees of latitude.


      NO.


      Wait, I made an error in my conclusion. Since New York City is at a higher latitude
      than Los Angeles, and 10013 is in New York City while 90291 is in Los Angeles,
      the correct answer is:


      YES.'
