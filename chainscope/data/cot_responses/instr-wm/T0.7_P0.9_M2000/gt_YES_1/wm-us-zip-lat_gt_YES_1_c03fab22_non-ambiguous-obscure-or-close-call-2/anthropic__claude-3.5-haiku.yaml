      2. Let''s look at the specific zip codes:

      - 10011 is in New York (NY)

      - 90069 is in California (CA)


      3. Geographic location:

      - New York is on the East Coast of the United States

      - California is on the West Coast of the United States


      4. Relative positioning:

      - The East Coast is geographically north of the West Coast

      - New York is further north than California


      5. Conclusion:

      - A zip code from NY (10011) would be located north of a zip code from CA (90069)


      Therefore, the answer is: YES'
