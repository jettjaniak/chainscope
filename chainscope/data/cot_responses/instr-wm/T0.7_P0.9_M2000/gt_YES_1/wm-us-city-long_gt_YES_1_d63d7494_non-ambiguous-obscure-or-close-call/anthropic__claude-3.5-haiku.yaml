      1. First, let''s consider the geographical locations of New Orleans and Denver
      in the United States.


      2. New Orleans is located in southeastern Louisiana, near the Gulf of Mexico.


      3. Denver is located in the central part of Colorado, in the western United
      States.


      4. To determine their relative east-west positioning, I''ll visualize their

      5. New Orleans is much further east than Denver. It is in the southeastern part
      of the country, while Denver is in the central-western region.


      6. Therefore, New Orleans is definitively east of Denver.

    e1c4e1ed-bba6-47bd-babe-9d769563d1ed: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s understand the locations of Queens, NY and Phoenix, AZ on a
      map of the United States.


      2. Queens is located in New York City, which is on the East Coast of the United
      States.


      3. Phoenix is located in Arizona, which is in the southwestern part of the United
      States.


      4. If we imagine a vertical line running north-south through the United States,
      Queens would be east of this line, while Phoenix would be west of this line.


      5. This means Queens is geographically east of Phoenix.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.'
