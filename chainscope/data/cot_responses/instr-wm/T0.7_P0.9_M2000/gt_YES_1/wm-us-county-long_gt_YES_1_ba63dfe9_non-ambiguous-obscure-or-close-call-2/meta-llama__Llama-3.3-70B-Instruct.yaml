      1. **Identify the locations**: Queens County is in New York, and San Diego County
      is in California.

      2. **General geography of the United States**: New York is on the East Coast,
      while California is on the West Coast.

      3. **Relative positions**: Since New York is to the east of California, any
      county in New York, including Queens County, would be east of any county in
      California, including San Diego County.


      Therefore, based on the geographical positions of New York and California, the
      answer is: **YES**.'
