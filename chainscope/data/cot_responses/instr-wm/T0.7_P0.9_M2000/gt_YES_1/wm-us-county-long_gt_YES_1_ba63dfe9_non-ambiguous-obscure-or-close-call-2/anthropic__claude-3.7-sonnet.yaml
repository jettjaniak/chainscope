      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Philadelphia County, PA is in Pennsylvania, on the eastern coast of the United
      States.

      - Orleans Parish, LA is in Louisiana, in the southern part of the United States
      near the Gulf of Mexico.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on the US map.

      - Pennsylvania is in the northeastern United States.

      - Louisiana is in the southeastern United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - Pennsylvania is significantly farther east than Louisiana.

      - Philadelphia is on the eastern edge of Pennsylvania.

      - Orleans Parish (which contains New Orleans) is in southeastern Louisiana.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Philadelphia County is in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania
      itself is much farther east than Louisiana, Philadelphia County must be east
      of Orleans Parish.

      To determine this, I need to think about the geographic locations of these two
      counties within the United States.


      Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties.

      - Palm Beach County is located in Florida (FL), which is on the east coast of
      the United States.

      - Napa County is located in California (CA), which is on the west coast of the
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions.

      - Florida is in the southeastern part of the United States.

      - California is in the western part of the United States.

      - The continental United States spans from west (Pacific Ocean) to east (Atlantic
      Ocean).


      Step 3: Compare their positions on an east-west axis.

      - California is the westernmost state in the contiguous United States, bordering
      the Pacific Ocean.

      - Florida is near the easternmost part of the United States, with its east coast
      on the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Moving from west to east across the United States, you would encounter California
      first, then eventually Florida.


      Therefore, Palm Beach County, FL is located east of Napa County, CA.

      3) The continental United States is oriented such that the east coast is to
      the east of the west coast.


      4) Since Florida is on the east coast and California is on the west coast, Palm
      Beach County (FL) must be east of Napa County (CA).


      5) To verify: Palm Beach County is in southeastern Florida, while Napa County
      is in northern California. The entire state of Florida is east of the entire
      state of California.


      YES, Palm Beach County, FL is located east of Napa County, CA.'

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both counties.

      - Richmond County, NY is on Staten Island, which is part of New York City in
      the state of New York, located on the East Coast of the United States.

      - Clark County, NV is in the state of Nevada, located in the western United
      States. Las Vegas is in Clark County.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on the US map.

      - New York is on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      - Nevada is in the western part of the United States, near California.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positioning.

      - States on the East Coast (like New York) are east of states in the western
      United States (like Nevada).

      - Therefore, Richmond County in New York is east of Clark County in Nevada.

      \nStep 1: I need to identify the locations of Wayne County, MI and Harris County,\
      \ TX.\n- Wayne County, MI is in Michigan, which is in the northeastern part\
      \ of the United States. It contains Detroit and is located along the eastern\
      \ edge of Michigan.\n- Harris County, TX is in Texas, which is in the southern\
      \ United States. It contains Houston and is located in the southeastern part\
      \ of Texas.\n\nStep 2: Compare their east-west positions.\n- Michigan is significantly\
      \ east of Texas on the US map.\n- Wayne County is in the eastern part of Michigan.\n\
      - Harris County is in the eastern part of Texas.\n- Even though both counties\
      \ are in the eastern portions of their respective states, Michigan as a whole\
      \ is much further east than Texas.\n\nStep 3: Make the determination based on\
      \ longitude (east-west position).\n- Wayne County, MI is approximately around\
      \ 83\xB0 W longitude.\n- Harris County, TX is approximately around 95\xB0 W\
      \ longitude.\n- Lower longitude numbers in the Western Hemisphere indicate more\
