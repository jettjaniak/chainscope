      1) First, let me recall the locations:

      - Philadelphia County, PA is in eastern Pennsylvania, on the Delaware River

      - Orleans Parish, LA (which contains New Orleans) is in southern Louisiana,
      near the Gulf of Mexico


      2) To compare east-west positions, I need to think about relative longitudes:

      - Philadelphia is near the Atlantic coast

      - New Orleans is near the Gulf Coast, but significantly further west


      3) Looking at a mental map of the US:

      - Philadelphia is roughly aligned with the East Coast

      - New Orleans is much further west, roughly aligned with the middle of the Gulf
      Coast
