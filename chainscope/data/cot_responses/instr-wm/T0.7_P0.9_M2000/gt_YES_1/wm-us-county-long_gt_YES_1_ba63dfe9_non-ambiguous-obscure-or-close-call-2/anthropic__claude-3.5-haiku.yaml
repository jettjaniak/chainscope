      4. Therefore, Queens County, NY is located east of San Diego County, CA.


      Answer: YES'
    ed946faf-dcfa-46ac-8318-999d545704e1: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Queens County is located in New York City, on the eastern part of Long Island,
      in the northeastern United States.


      2. San Diego County is located in southern California, on the west coast of
      the United States.


      3. To determine if Queens County is east of San Diego County, we need to compare
      their geographic locations.


      4. Looking at a map of the United States, Queens County, NY is much further
      east than San Diego County, CA.


      5. In fact, Queens County is on the eastern side of the continental United States,
      while San Diego County is on the western side.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES, Queens County, NY is located east of San Diego
      County, CA.'
