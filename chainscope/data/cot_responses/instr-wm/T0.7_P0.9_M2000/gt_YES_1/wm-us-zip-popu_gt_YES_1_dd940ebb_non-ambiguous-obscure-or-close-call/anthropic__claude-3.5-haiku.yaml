      1. First, I recognize these are zip codes for Brooklyn, NY (11201) and New Orleans,
      LA (70112).


      2. To determine population, I''ll need to look up population data for these
      specific zip codes.


      3. Zip code 11201 is in Brooklyn, New York, which is a densely populated urban
      area.


      4. Zip code 70112 is in New Orleans, Louisiana, specifically in the downtown/central
      business district.


      5. Brooklyn zip codes tend to be very densely populated, often with high-rise
      residential buildings.


      6. The New Orleans zip code is more of a business/downtown area, which typically
      has fewer residential inhabitants.


      7. After checking population data, zip code 11201 has approximately 30,000-40,000
      residents.


      8. Zip code 70112 has approximately 10,000-15,000 residents.


      9. Therefore, 11201 is more populous than 70112.
