      we need to compare the release dates of the two books: Liane Moriarty''s "The
      Husband''s Secret" and Jennifer Egan''s "A Visit from the Goon Squad".


      Step 1: Identify the release date of Liane Moriarty''s "The Husband''s Secret".

      Liane Moriarty''s "The Husband''s Secret" was released in 2013.


      Step 2: Identify the release date of Jennifer Egan''s "A Visit from the Goon

      Step 3: Compare the release dates to determine if "Mistborn: The Well of Ascension"
      was released later than "The Empire Strikes Back".

      Since 2007 is later than 1980, "Mistborn: The Well of Ascension" was indeed
      released later than "The Empire Strikes Back".


      Therefore, the answer is: YES.
