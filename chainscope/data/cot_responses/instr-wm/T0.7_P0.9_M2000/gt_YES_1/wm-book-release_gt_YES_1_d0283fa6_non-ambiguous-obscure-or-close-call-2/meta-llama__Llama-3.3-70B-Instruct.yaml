      - Hannibal was released on June 8, 1999.


      Since 2010 is later than 1999, Mockingjay was released later than Hannibal.

      2. Next, let''s find the release date of "The Talented Mr. Ripley". "The Talented
      Mr. Ripley" was published in 1955.

      3. Now, we compare the two release dates: 1940 (Pat the Bunny) and 1955 (The
      Talented Mr. Ripley).

      4. Since 1940 is earlier than 1955, "Pat the Bunny" was released before "The
      Talented Mr. Ripley".


      Given this information, the answer to whether "Pat the Bunny" was released later
      than "The Talented Mr. Ripley" is: NO.'

      and since "The Fantastic Journey" seems to be an alternative title for one of
      the books in the series, we can assume it was also published around that time
      or later. However, to be precise, the book actually titled "The Fantastic Journey"
      in some regions is the third book in the series, which was originally published
      as "The Fantastic Journey" in 1987 in the UK, under the title "The Fantastic
      Journey" but in the US, the third book was published in 1988 under the title
      "The Fantastic Journey" but originally in the US as "Where''s Waldo? The Fantastic

      Fifth Season" is the first book in The Broken Earth trilogy. It was published
      in 2015.


      2. **Identify the release date of "Where''s Wally? The Fantastic Journey"**:
      The "Where''s Wally?" series by Martin Handford started in 1987 with the first
      book titled "Where''s Wally?" (published as "Where''s Waldo?" in North America).
      "The Fantastic Journey" is the third book in the series and was published in
      1987 as well, in some regions, but more commonly noted as being published in
      1988 in others. However, considering the initial publication of the series,
      we can safely say that the first book was out in 1987.


      Given these dates:

      - "Where''s Wally? The Fantastic Journey" (or simply the series'' start) was

      Wally? The Fantastic Journey" (considering the series start and its third book''s
      publication window) was published in 1987 or 1988, "The Fifth Season" was indeed

      is part of The Magic School Bus series, which was written by Joanna Cole and
      illustrated by Bruce Degen. The first book in the series, "The Magic School
      Bus at the Waterworks," was published in 1986, but "The Magic School Bus Lost
      in the Solar System" specifically was published in 1990.


      Given these dates, we can conclude that since "Love Story" was published in
      1970 and "The Magic School Bus Lost in the Solar System" was published in 1990,
      the latter was indeed released later than the former.

      book in the Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson. It was published in 2007.


      2. **Donald F. Glut''s The Empire Strikes Back**: This book is a novelization
      of the second Star Wars film, "The Empire Strikes Back." The film was released
      in 1980, and novelizations are typically published close to the film''s release
      date. Therefore, Donald F. Glut''s novelization of "The Empire Strikes Back"
      was published in 1980.


      Comparing the release years:

      - **Mistborn: The Well of Ascension** was released in 2007.

      - **The Empire Strikes Back** novelization was released in 1980.


      Given that 2007 is later than 1980, the answer to whether Brandon Sanderson''s
      **Mistborn: The Well of Ascension** was released later than Donald F. Glut''s
      **The Empire Strikes Back** is **YES**.'
