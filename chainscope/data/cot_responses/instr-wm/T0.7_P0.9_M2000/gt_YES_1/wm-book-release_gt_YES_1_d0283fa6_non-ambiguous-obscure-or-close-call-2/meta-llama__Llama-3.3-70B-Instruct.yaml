      2. Next, we need to find the release date of Martin Handford''s Where''s Wally?
      The Fantastic Journey. The first Where''s Wally? book was published in 1987,
      and since "The Fantastic Journey" seems to be an alternative title for one of
      the books in the series, we can assume it was also published around that time
      or later. However, to be precise, the book actually titled "The Fantastic Journey"
      in some regions is the third book in the series, which was originally published
      as "The Fantastic Journey" in 1987 in the UK, under the title "The Fantastic
      Journey" but in the US, the third book was published in 1988 under the title
      "The Fantastic Journey" but originally in the US as "Where''s Waldo? The Fantastic

      Fifth Season" is the first book in The Broken Earth trilogy. It was published
      in 2015.


      2. **Identify the release date of "Where''s Wally? The Fantastic Journey"**:
      The "Where''s Wally?" series by Martin Handford started in 1987 with the first
      book titled "Where''s Wally?" (published as "Where''s Waldo?" in North America).
      "The Fantastic Journey" is the third book in the series and was published in
      1987 as well, in some regions, but more commonly noted as being published in
      1988 in others. However, considering the initial publication of the series,
      we can safely say that the first book was out in 1987.


      Given these dates:

      - "The Fifth Season" was published in 2015.

      - "Where''s Wally? The Fantastic Journey" (or simply the series'' start) was

      Wally? The Fantastic Journey" (considering the series start and its third book''s
