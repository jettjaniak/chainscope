      in 1990

      - The Dark Tower (1982) came BEFORE The Eye of the World (1990)

      - 1982 is earlier than 1990


      Therefore: NO'

      - The Subtle Knife by Philip Pullman was published in 1997

      - Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer was published in 2001


      2. To determine if Artemis Fowl was released later, I need to compare these
      dates:

      - 2001 comes after 1997


      3. Therefore, since Artemis Fowl (2001) was published after The Subtle Knife
      (1997), it was indeed released later.
