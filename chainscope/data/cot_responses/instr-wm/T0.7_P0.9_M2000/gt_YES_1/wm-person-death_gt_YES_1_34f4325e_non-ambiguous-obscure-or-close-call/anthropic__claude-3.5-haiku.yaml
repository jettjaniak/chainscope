      - He was the father of the famous Italian poet Dante Alighieri

      - He lived in Florence, Italy in the late 13th century


      2. When did Alighiero di Bellincione live?

      - He was born around 1210-1220 and died around 1280-1290

      - Cleopatra VII ruled Egypt from 51-30 BCE

      4. Comparing their lifetimes:

      - Alighiero di Bellincione lived in the late 13th century (around 1280-1290)

    796c5417-3206-46ec-8219-08ce41ec7fcc: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, identify when Spartacus lived:

      - Spartacus was a Thracian gladiator who led a slave rebellion against the Roman
      Republic

      - He lived in the 1st century BC, specifically around 111-71 BC

      - He died in 71 BC during the Third Servile War


      2. Next, identify when Richard I (Richard the Lionheart) lived:

      - Richard I was King of England from 1189 to 1199

      - He lived from 1157 to 1199 AD

      - He died in 1199 during a siege in France


      3. Compare the time periods:

      - Spartacus died in 71 BC

      - Richard I died in 1199 AD

      - This means Richard I died approximately 1,270 years after Spartacus


      4. Conclusion:

      Since Richard I died much later than Spartacus, the answer is:


      YES'
