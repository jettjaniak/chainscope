      \ in California.\n\n2. **Determine the Cities**:\n   - The zip code 10023 is\
      \ associated with New York City, specifically the Upper West Side of Manhattan.\n\
      \   - The zip code 90291 is associated with Venice, California, a neighborhood\
      \ in Los Angeles County.\n\n3. **Population Comparison**:\n   - To compare the\
      \ population, we need to look at the population of these zip codes or their\
      \ associated areas. \n   - As of my last update, the population of New York\

      \nGiven the information typically available and the general population sizes\
      \ of New York City and Venice, California, it's reasonable to infer that the\

      \ \n   - Zip code 10023 is located in Manhattan, New York City, New York.\n\
      \   - Zip code 90291 is located in Venice, Los Angeles County, California.\n\
      \n2. **Understand population density and distribution**:\n   - New York City,\
      \ particularly Manhattan, is known for its high population density. It is one\
      \ of the most densely populated urban areas in the United States.\n   - Venice,\
      \ Los Angeles, is part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. While it is in\
      \ a populous region, Venice itself is a smaller, coastal community with a lower\
      \ population density compared to Manhattan.\n\n3. **Research population data**:\n\
      \   - As of my last update, the population of Manhattan (New York County) is\

      \ For 10023, NY: This zip code is located in Manhattan, New York City, which\
