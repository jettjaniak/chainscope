      - ZIP code 10024 is located in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City.
      This is a densely populated residential area with many apartment buildings.

      - ZIP code 70112 is located in New Orleans, Louisiana, and includes downtown
      and parts of the French Quarter. This area is more commercial and tourist-focused,
      with fewer residential buildings compared to Manhattan.


      Step 2: Compare population densities and estimates.

      - Manhattan ZIP codes are among the most densely populated in the country. ZIP
      code 10024, which includes Riverside Park and the American Museum of Natural
      History, has a large number of residents.

      - ZIP code 70112, being more commercial and less residential, typically has
      a much smaller population.


      Step 3: Use available population data (based on recent estimates).

      - ZIP code 10024 has an estimated population of around 60,000 to 65,000 people.

      - ZIP code 70112 has an estimated population of around 3,000 to 4,000 people.


      Conclusion: ZIP code 10024 in New York is significantly more populous than ZIP
      code 70112 in Louisiana.

      of single-family homes, many of which are large and on spacious lots. The overall
      population density is low.


      Step 3: Look at estimated population figures.

      While exact population numbers can vary slightly depending on the year and data
      source, generally:

      - ZIP code 10014 (Manhattan) has a population in the ballpark of 30,000 to 35,000
      people.

      - ZIP code 90265 (Malibu) has a population closer to 12,000 to 15,000 people.

      York is more populous than ZIP code 90291 in California, we need to follow a
      few reasoning steps:


      Step 1: Identify the areas covered by each ZIP code.

      - ZIP code 10023 is located in Manhattan, New York City. It includes parts of
      the Upper West Side, a densely populated urban area.

      - ZIP code 90291 is located in Venice, Los Angeles, California. It includes
      the Venice neighborhood, which is also urban but generally less dense than parts
      of Manhattan.


      Step 2: Compare population densities.

      - Manhattan is known for its very high population density, among the highest
      in the United States.

      - Venice, CA is less densely populated, with a mix of residential and commercial
      areas, and more space per housing unit.


      Step 3: Consider actual population figures (based on recent estimates, such
      as from the U.S. Census or other sources).

      - As of recent data (e.g., U.S. Census or ZIP code demographic databases), ZIP
      code 10023 has an estimated population of around 60,000 to 65,000 people.
