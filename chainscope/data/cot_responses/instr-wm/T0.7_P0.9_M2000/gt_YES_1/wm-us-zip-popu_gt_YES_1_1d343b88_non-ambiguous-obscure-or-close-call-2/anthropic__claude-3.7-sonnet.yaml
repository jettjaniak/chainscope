      like SoHo, Tribeca, and parts of Chinatown.

      - 70130 covers parts of New Orleans, including portions of the Central Business
      District and Warehouse District.


      Step 3: Compare population density and characteristics.

      - Manhattan is one of the most densely populated urban areas in the United States.

      - The 10013 zip code in Manhattan contains high-rise residential buildings and
      dense urban development.

      - New Orleans (70130) is less densely populated than Manhattan, with lower-rise
      buildings on average.


      Step 4: Consider typical population patterns of these areas.

      - Manhattan zip codes typically have very high population densities, often exceeding
      50,000 people per square mile.

      - Downtown New Orleans areas have significant commercial presence but lower
      residential density than comparable Manhattan areas.
