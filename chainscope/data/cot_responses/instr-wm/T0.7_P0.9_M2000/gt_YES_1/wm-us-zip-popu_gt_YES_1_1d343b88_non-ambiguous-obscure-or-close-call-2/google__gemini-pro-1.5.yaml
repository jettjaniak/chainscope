      11201 (New York) and 02554 (Massachusetts).

      2. **Recognize the need for population data:** To compare populations, we need
      data on how many people live in each zip code.

      3. **Find a reliable source for population data:**  A good source would be the
      US Census Bureau or a reputable data aggregator that uses census data.

      4. **Look up the populations:**  (This requires an internet search which I as
      a language model cannot perform directly.)  I would search for "population of
      11201" and "population of 02554".

      5. **Compare the populations:** Once the populations are found, compare the
      numbers.

      6. **Determine if 11201 has a larger population than 02554:** Based on the comparison,
      determine if the statement is true or false.


      Since I cannot access the internet to look up the populations, I cannot give
      a YES/NO answer.  A user would need to perform the search and comparison.

    d96e314c-2a77-4531-872c-d528c4fb8a3a: '1. **Identify the locations:**
      11201 corresponds to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY, and 02554 corresponds to Onset,
      MA (a CDP within the town of Wareham).

      2. **Consider population density:** Brooklyn, NY is a densely populated urban
      area, while Onset, MA is a much smaller, less densely populated coastal community.

      3. **Infer population size:** Given the difference in population density and
      the size of the areas these zip codes represent, it is highly likely that 11201
      has a larger population than 02554.

      likely more populous.

      I can''t definitively say.  I need to look up the populations.  *However*, 10023
      is in Manhattan, NYC, a very densely populated area, and 90291 is in Venice,
      CA, also a populated area, but likely less dense than Manhattan. Therefore,
      I would *guess* YES, but this is just an educated guess.


      Without real data, I can''t give a confirmed YES or NO.
