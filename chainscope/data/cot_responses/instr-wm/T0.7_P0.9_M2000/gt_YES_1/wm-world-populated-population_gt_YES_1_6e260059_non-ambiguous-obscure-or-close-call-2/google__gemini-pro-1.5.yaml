      We are comparing the populations of Ankara and Medina.

      2. **What do we need to know?**  We need to know the approximate populations
      of both cities.

      3. **Ankara''s population:** Ankara is the capital of Turkey, a large country.  It''s
      a major city and likely has a large population, probably several million.

      4. **Medina''s population:** Medina is a city in Saudi Arabia, a holy city for
      Muslims. While important, it is not the capital and likely smaller than Ankara.

      5. **Comparison:**  A large capital city (Ankara) is likely more populous than
      a smaller, albeit important religious city (Medina).

      area" and "City of Sydney."**  We need to be clear about what geographical entities
      are being compared. "Urban area" usually refers to a continuously built-up area,
      while "City of Sydney" likely refers to the official boundaries of the local
      government area.  This distinction is crucial because urban areas can extend
      beyond official city limits.


      * **Step 2: Find population data for Stockholm urban area.** We need reliable
      population figures for both areas.  A source like the World Population Review
      or Demographia would be useful.


      * **Step 3: Find population data for the City of Sydney.**  Again, a reliable
      source is needed.  The Australian Bureau of Statistics would be a good place
      to look.


      * **Step 4: Compare the two population figures.**  Once we have both numbers,
      we can determine which is larger.


      * **Step 5: Answer the question.**


      According to Demographia, the Stockholm urban area (which they refer to as the
      "tettsted") has a population of 1.63 million (2023). The City of Sydney has
      a population of approximately 250,000 (2021, Australian Bureau of Statistics).


      Therefore, the answer is **YES**.
