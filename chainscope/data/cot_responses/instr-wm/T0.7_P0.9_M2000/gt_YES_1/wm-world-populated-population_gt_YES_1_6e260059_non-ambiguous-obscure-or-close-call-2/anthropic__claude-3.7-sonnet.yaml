      Step 1: Let me identify what Java and Houston are.

      - Java is an island in Indonesia, one of the most populous islands in the world.

      - Houston is a city in Texas, USA.


      Step 2: Let me estimate the population of Java.

      - Java is home to more than half of Indonesia''s population.

      - Indonesia has approximately 270-280 million people.

      - Java''s population is estimated to be around 150 million people.


      Step 3: Let me estimate the population of Houston.

      - Houston is one of the largest cities in the United States.

      - Houston''s population is approximately 2.3 million within city limits.

      - Even considering the greater Houston metropolitan area, the population is
      around 7 million.


      Step 4: Compare the populations.

      - Java: ~150 million people

      - Houston: ~2.3 million (city proper) or ~7 million (metro area)

      - Java''s population is many times larger than Houston''s population.

      - Bali is an island in Indonesia

      - Pyongyang is the capital city of North Korea

      - Bali is an entire island province in Indonesia

      - Bali has multiple cities and towns across the island

      - Bali''s population is approximately 4.3-4.5 million people


      Step 3: Let me estimate the population of Pyongyang.

      - Pyongyang is a single city, though a large capital city

      - Pyongyang''s population is approximately 3.0-3.2 million people

      Long Island is part of New York State in the United States. It includes four
      counties: Kings (Brooklyn), Queens, Nassau, and Suffolk. The population of Long
      Island is approximately 7.5-8 million people.

      Machupicchu District (also spelled Machu Picchu) is a district in Peru where
      the famous Inca citadel is located. It''s a relatively small administrative
      district. The population of Machupicchu District is approximately 5,000-10,000

      which region has more people.


      Step 1: Determine the population of Mainland Australia.

      Australia has a total population of approximately 26 million people. The mainland
      contains almost all of Australia''s population, with only a small fraction living
      in Tasmania and other territories. So mainland Australia''s population is roughly
      25-26 million people.


      Step 2: Determine the population of the Community of Madrid.

      The Community of Madrid is an autonomous community of Spain that includes Madrid
      (the capital city) and surrounding areas. Its population is approximately 6-7
      million people.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      Mainland Australia: ~25-26 million people

      Community of Madrid: ~6-7 million people


      Since 25-26 million is significantly larger than 6-7 million, mainland Australia
      has a much larger population than the Community of Madrid.

      Australia has a total population of approximately 26 million people. Mainland
      Australia would exclude Tasmania and other small islands, but these represent
      a small fraction of Australia''s total population. Even with these exclusions,
      mainland Australia would still have well over 25 million people.


      Step 2: Determine the population of the Community of Madrid.

      The Community of Madrid is an autonomous community of Spain that includes Madrid
      (the capital city) and surrounding areas. Its population is approximately 6-7
      million people.

      Punjab could refer to either the Indian state of Punjab or the Pakistani province

      - Indian Punjab has a population of approximately 28-30 million people.

      - Pakistani Punjab has a population of approximately 110-120 million people.


      Step 2: Identify what "River Nile (state)" refers to.

      There isn''t actually a state or province officially called "River Nile state"

      which is what this question is likely referring to.

      The Republic of Crimea (excluding Sevastopol, which is sometimes counted separately)
      has a population of approximately 1.9-2 million people. Including Sevastopol
      would add about 400,000 people, bringing the total to around 2.3-2.4 million.


      Step 3: Compare the two populations.

      Inner London: ~3.2-3.5 million

      Republic of Crimea: ~1.9-2.4 million (depending on whether Sevastopol is included)


      Even with the highest estimate for Crimea and the lowest estimate for Inner
      London, Inner London has a larger population.


      NO, the Republic of Crimea is not more populous than Inner London. Inner London
      has a larger population.'
