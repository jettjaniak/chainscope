      \ **Population of Singapore Island**: As of the last available census, the population\

      \ the population of the island can be considered roughly equivalent to the population\
      \ of the country itself.\n\n4. **Population of Bondi, New South Wales**: Bondi\
      \ is a suburb of Sydney, and its population is significantly smaller. According\
      \ to the 2016 census, the population of Bondi Beach (which would include the\
      \ broader area around Bondi) was around 11,000 people. More recent data might\
      \ show slight variations, but it remains a small fraction of Singapore's population.\n\
      \n5. **Comparison**: Comparing the population of Singapore Island (approximately\
      \ 5.69 million) with that of Bondi, New South Wales (around 11,000), it is clear\

      population of Bangalore. As of my last update, Bangalore (also known as Bengaluru),
      the capital of Karnataka state in India, has a population of around 12.3 million
      people within its metropolitan area.


      2. **Identify the Population of Upper East Side**: Next, we need to determine
      the population of the Upper East Side. The Upper East Side is a neighborhood
      in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. The population of the Upper East
      Side is approximately 200,000 people.

      1. **Identify the Places**: Punjab is a region located in the northern part
      of the Indian subcontinent, spanning parts of India and Pakistan. River Nile
      (state) is a state in South Sudan, named after the River Nile that flows through
      it.


      2. **Population of Punjab**: Punjab is a densely populated region with a rich
      cultural and historical heritage. As of the 2011 census, the population of Punjab,
      India, was approximately 27.7 million. The population of Punjab, Pakistan, is
      around 110 million. Combining these, we can estimate the total population of
      Punjab to be around 137.7 million.


      3. **Population of River Nile (state)**: River Nile (state) is one of the least
      populous states in South Sudan. According to the 2008 Sudanese census, the population
      of the River Nile (state) was approximately 1.2 million.


      4. **Comparison**: Comparing the populations, Punjab has a much larger population
      than River Nile (state). Punjab''s population is around 137.7 million, while
      River Nile (state) has a population of approximately 1.2 million.

      River Nile (state)?" is: **YES**'
    2e9a59ff-dbe2-4dec-903f-e00d9cc12ea2: 'To answer this question,
      let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Identify the Places**: First, we need to identify the places mentioned
      in the question. "Punjab" refers to a region in northern India and eastern Pakistan.
      "River Nile (state)" is not a common way to refer to a state or region, so it''s
      likely a typo or an error. I''ll assume it refers to the Nile River.


      2. **Population of Punjab**: The population of Punjab varies depending on whether
      you consider the Indian Punjab or the Pakistani Punjab. As of the latest census,
      the population of the Indian state of Punjab is around 27.7 million, while the
      population of Pakistani Punjab is approximately 110 million.


      3. **Population of Nile River**: The Nile River is a river in Africa, not a
      state or region. It runs through several countries, including Egypt, Sudan,
      South Sudan, and others. The population living along the Nile River is not a
      single entity and varies widely depending on the region.


      4. **Comparison**: Comparing the population of Punjab (either Indian or Pakistani)
      with the population living along the Nile River is not straightforward, as the
      Nile River is not a state or region with a defined population. However, we can
      compare the population of Punjab with the population of the countries through
      which the Nile River flows.


      5. **Conclusion**: Given that the population of Punjab (both Indian and Pakistani)
      is in the tens of millions, and the population of countries along the Nile River,
      such as Egypt and Sudan, is in the tens of millions as well, we can conclude
      that the population of Punjab is comparable to the population living along the
      Nile River. Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Punjab more populous than
