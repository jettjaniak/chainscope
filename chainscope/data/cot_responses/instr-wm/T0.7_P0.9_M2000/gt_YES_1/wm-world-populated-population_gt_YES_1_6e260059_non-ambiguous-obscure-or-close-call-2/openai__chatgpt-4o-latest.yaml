      1. **Understanding what Java is**: Java is an island in Indonesia. It is one
      of the major islands of the country and includes major cities like Jakarta (the
      capital of Indonesia), Surabaya, and Bandung.


      2. **Population of Java**: Java is one of the most densely populated places
      in the world. As of recent estimates, Java has a population of over 140 million
      people. This makes it the most populous island in the world.


      3. **Understanding what Houston is**: Houston is a city in the state of Texas,
      USA.


      4. **Population of Houston**: As of recent estimates (2020s), the city of Houston
      has a population of approximately 2.3 million people. Even if we consider the
      Greater Houston metropolitan area, the population is around 7 million.


      5. **Comparison**: Java''s population (>140 million) is vastly larger than both
      the city proper and the metropolitan area of Houston (~7 million).


      Answer: **YES**.'

      **Understanding the Question:**

      The question is asking whether Normandy is more populous than *Australia* and
      *Cuba*. This could be interpreted as either:

      1. Normandy is more populous than both Australia and Cuba individually.

      2. Normandy is more populous than the combined population of Australia and Cuba.


      Either way, we need to compare the population of Normandy with Australia and
      Cuba.

      - Australia has a population of about 26 million people.

      - Cuba has a population of about 11 million people.

      - Normandy (3.3 million) vs. Australia (26 million): Normandy is significantly
      less populous.

      - Normandy (3.3 million) vs. Cuba (11 million): Again, Normandy is less populous.

      - Tuscany is a region in central Italy.

      - Stockholm is both a city and a county in Sweden, but typically when people
      refer to "Stockholm," they mean the city or the metropolitan area.


      Step 2: Determine the population of Tuscany.

      - As of recent data (2023), the population of Tuscany is approximately 3.6 million
      people.


      Step 3: Determine the population of Stockholm.

      - The population of Stockholm city proper is about 1 million.

      - The larger Stockholm metropolitan area has around 2.5 to 2.6 million people.


      Step 4: Compare the populations.

      - Tuscany: ~3.6 million

      - Stockholm metro area: ~2.5 to 2.6 million

      1. **Identify Ankara**: Ankara is the capital city of Turkey. It is one of the
      largest cities in the country, second only to Istanbul in terms of population.


      2. **Population of Ankara**: As of recent estimates (circa 2023-2024), Ankara
      has a population of approximately 5.5 to 6 million people.


      3. **Identify Medina**: Medina is a significant city in Saudi Arabia, known
      for its religious importance in Islam. It is not the largest city in Saudi Arabia;
      Riyadh and Jeddah are more populous.


      4. **Population of Medina**: Medina''s population is significantly smaller than
      that of Ankara. As of recent estimates, Medina has a population of about 1.5
      to 2 million people.


      5. **Compare the populations**: Ankara''s population (5.5-6 million) is clearly
      larger than Medina''s (1.5-2 million).


      **Conclusion**: Based on the population figures, Ankara is more populous than
      Medina.

      Step 1: Understand what Punjab, India is.

      - Punjab is a state in northern India.

      - As of recent estimates (2021-2023), the population of Punjab is approximately
      30 million people.

      - The population of Shinjuku is much smaller than a whole state; as of recent
      estimates, it is around 350,000 to 400,000 people.


      Step 3: Compare the populations.

      - Punjab: ~30,000,000 people

      - Shinjuku: ~400,000 people

      to, then compare the populations.


      Step 1: Identify "Punjab"

      - Punjab is a region divided between two countries: India and Pakistan.

      - Indian Punjab is a state in northern India.

      - Pakistani Punjab is a province in eastern Pakistan.

      - Pakistani Punjab is significantly more populous than Indian Punjab.

      - For this comparison, it''s important to know which Punjab is being referred
      to. If unspecified, the more populous Pakistani Punjab is often meant in demographic
      comparisons.


      Step 2: Identify "River Nile (state)"

      - There is no country or administrative region officially called "River Nile
      (state)".

      - However, there is a state in Sudan called "River Nile State" (or "Wilayat
      Nahr an-Nil").

      - This is an actual administrative region in Sudan, located along the Nile River.


      Step 3: Compare populations

      - Population of Punjab (Pakistan): Over 110 million people (as of 2023 estimates).

      - Population of River Nile State (Sudan): Approximately 1.5 to 2 million people

      1. Identify the population of Central Athens (regional unit).

      2. Identify the population of the Upper West Side.

      3. Compare the two numbers.


      Step 1: Population of Central Athens (regional unit)

      - Central Athens is one of the regional units of the Attica region in Greece
      and includes the central part of the Athens urban area.

      - As of the 2011 Greek census, the population of Central Athens was approximately
      1,090,000 people.


      Step 2: Population of the Upper West Side

      - The Upper West Side is a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan in New York
      City.

      - According to recent estimates (e.g., from the U.S. Census or NYC planning
      data), the population of the Upper West Side is around 200,000 to 220,000 people.


      Step 3: Compare the two populations

      - Central Athens: ~1,090,000

      - Upper West Side: ~200,000


      Conclusion:

      Central Athens (regional unit) is significantly more populous than the Upper
