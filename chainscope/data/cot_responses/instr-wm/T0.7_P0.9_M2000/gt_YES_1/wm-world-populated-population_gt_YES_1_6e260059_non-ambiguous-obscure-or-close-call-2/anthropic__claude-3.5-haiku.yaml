      1. First, let''s consider Giza:

      - Giza is a city in Egypt

      - It''s part of the Greater Cairo metropolitan area

      - Giza has a large population, with over 4 million people in its metropolitan
      area


      2. Now, let''s consider Monte Carlo:

      - Monte Carlo is a small administrative area in Monaco

      - Monaco is a very small country, with a total population of around 38,000

      - Monte Carlo itself is even smaller, with a population of around 3,000-4,000
      people


      3. Comparing the populations:

      - Giza''s metropolitan area population: Over 4 million

      - Monte Carlo''s population: Around 3,000-4,000

    f9a41b78-69d3-44de-a307-2a112be1942a: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Punjab is a region/province located in two countries:

      - Northwestern India

      - Northeastern Pakistan


      2. Punjab as a region/province is a geographical and administrative area with
      a population.


      3. River Nile (state) refers to a specific state in Sudan, located along the
      Nile River.


      4. Population comparison:

      - Punjab (India + Pakistan combined) has a population of around 110-120 million
      people

      - River Nile state in Sudan has a population of approximately 1-2 million people


      5. Comparing the populations:

      - Punjab''s population is significantly larger than River Nile state''s population


      6. Therefore, Punjab is more populous than River Nile (state).
