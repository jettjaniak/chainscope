    f05d1840-89d3-4cb9-b7ca-83b9caa811a2: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, I''ll check the length of "The Dragon Reborn" by Robert Jordan:

      - This is the third book in the Wheel of Time fantasy series

      - It is a typical epic fantasy novel

      - Typically around 700-800 pages long


      2. Now, I''ll check the length of "Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No
      Good, Very Bad Day" by Judith Viorst:

      - This is a children''s picture book

      - These types of books are typically very short

      - Usually around 32-48 pages long


      3. Comparing the two:

      - "The Dragon Reborn" is hundreds of pages long

      - "Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day" is just a few
      dozen pages long


      4. Conclusion:

      The Robert Jordan book is significantly longer than the Judith Viorst book.

      \ I'll find the length of New Moon by Stephenie Meyer:\n\u2022 New Moon is a\
      \ novel in the Twilight series\n\u2022 Its typical published length is around\
      \ 563 pages\n\n2. Next, I'll find the length of Where's Wally Now by Martin\
      \ Handford:\n\u2022 This is a picture book/puzzle book\n\u2022 These types of\
      \ books typically have very few pages\n\u2022 Picture/puzzle books are usually\
      \ much shorter than novels\n\u2022 Where's Wally books are known for being image-focused,\
      \ not text-dense\n\n3. Comparing the two:\n\u2022 563 pages (New Moon) is significantly\
      \ longer than a typical picture book\n\u2022 Where's Wally Now is likely around\
      \ 30-40 pages maximum\n\n4. Conclusion:\n\u2022 New Moon is definitely longer\
      \ than Where's Wally Now\n\nTherefore, the answer is: YES."
