      is located east of Mount Carmel Center in Texas, we need to compare their longitudinal
      coordinates.


      1. **Identify the location of Fenway Park**: Fenway Park is located in Boston,
      Massachusetts. Boston is situated at approximately 71 degrees west longitude.


      2. **Identify the location of Mount Carmel Center**: Mount Carmel Center is
      near Waco, Texas. Waco is located at approximately 97 degrees west longitude.


      3. **Compare the longitudes**: Longitude increases as you move westward. Therefore,
      71 degrees west is east of 97 degrees west.


      Based on this reasoning, Fenway Park in Massachusetts is indeed located east
      of Mount Carmel Center in Texas.
