      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Fenway Park is in Boston, Massachusetts (MA).

      - Mount Carmel Center was in Waco, Texas (TX).


      Step 2: Determine their relative positions on a US map.

      - Boston, MA is located on the east coast of the United States.

      - Waco, TX is located in central Texas, which is in the southern central part
      of the United States.

      - Boston is near the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast, while Waco is much further
      west in the central part of the country.


      Step 4: Make the determination.

      - Since Boston (where Fenway Park is) is on the east coast, and Waco (where

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both buildings.

      - The United States Capitol is located in Washington, DC, on the east coast
      of the United States.

      - The Beverly Hills Hotel is located in Beverly Hills, California, on the west
      coast of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions of Washington, DC and Beverly Hills,
      CA.

      - Washington, DC is on the eastern side of the continental United States.

      - Beverly Hills, California is on the western side of the continental United
      States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions in terms of east-west orientation.

      - Moving from west to east across the United States, you would encounter California
      first, then eventually reach Washington, DC.

      - Therefore, Washington, DC is east of Beverly Hills, California.


      Step 4: Since the United States Capitol is in Washington, DC, and The Beverly
      Hills Hotel is in Beverly Hills, CA, the Capitol is east of the hotel.


      NO.


      Wait, I made an error in my conclusion. The correct answer is:


      YES, the United States Capitol in DC is located east of The Beverly Hills Hotel
      in CA.'

      Step 1: Let me identify the locations of both buildings.

      - The United States Capitol is in Washington, DC, on the east coast of the United
      States.

      - The Beverly Hills Hotel is in Beverly Hills, California, on the west coast
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the relative positions on a map of the United States.

      - Washington, DC is located on the eastern side of the country.

      - California is located on the western side of the country.


      Step 3: Compare their positions in terms of east-west orientation.

      - Moving from west to east across the United States, you would encounter California
      first, then eventually reach Washington, DC.

      - This means Washington, DC (and the Capitol building) is east of California
      (and The Beverly Hills Hotel).


      NO.


      Wait, I made a mistake in my answer. The question asks if the Capitol is east
      of the Beverly Hills Hotel, not west of it. Since Washington, DC is east of
      California, the United States Capitol is indeed east of The Beverly Hills Hotel.


      YES.'

      the relative positions of these two landmarks.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - United States Capitol is in Washington, DC, on the east coast of the United
      States.

      - The Beverly Hills Hotel is in Beverly Hills, California, on the west coast
      of the United States.


      Step 2: Consider the geographic positions of Washington, DC and California.

      - Washington, DC is located on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

      - California is located on the western coast of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their positions on a west-east axis.

      - The continental United States spans from west to east, with California on
      the western side and Washington, DC on the eastern side.

      - This means Washington, DC (and therefore the US Capitol) is east of California
