      2. Grigori Rasputin, on the other hand, was a Russian mystic and faith healer,

      let''s first look up the birth dates of Whitney Houston and Kim Jong-il.


      Whitney Houston was born on August 9, 1963.

      Kim Jong-il was born on February 16, 1941 (or 1942, according to some sources,
      but the most commonly cited year is 1941).


      Now, comparing the two birth dates:

      - Kim Jong-il was born in 1941.

      - Whitney Houston was born in 1963.


      Since 1963 is later than 1941, we can conclude that Whitney Houston was indeed
      born later than Kim Jong-il.


      The answer is: YES.'

      2. Then, we find the birth date of J. R. R. Tolkien: J. R. R. Tolkien was born
      on January 3, 1892.

      3. Now, we compare the two birth dates to determine who was born later: Since
      1920 is greater than 1892, Isaac Asimov was born later than J. R. R. Tolkien.

      1908.

      2. **Virginia Woolf''s birth date**: Virginia Woolf was born on January 25,
      1882.


      Now, comparing the two dates:


      - Oskar Schindler was born in 1908.

      - Virginia Woolf was born in 1882.


      Since 1908 is later than 1882, Oskar Schindler was indeed born later than Virginia
      Woolf.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      1. **Identify the Birth Year of Saint Valentine**: The historical figure of
      Saint Valentine is shrouded in mystery, and there are multiple saints with that
      name. The most commonly recognized Saint Valentine, associated with Valentine''s
      Day, is believed to have lived in the 3rd century AD. The exact dates of his

      1. **Identify the birth date of Larry King**: Larry King was born on November

      2. **Identify the birth date of Saint Valentine**: The birth date of Saint Valentine
      is not certain and varies depending on which Saint Valentine is being referred
      to, as there are at least two saints with this name. However, it is generally
      agreed that Saint Valentine, or at least one of the saints by that name, lived

      we need to compare the birth dates of Larry King and Saint Valentine.


      1. **Identify the birth date of Larry King**: Larry King was born on November
      19, 1933.

      2. **Identify the birth date of Saint Valentine**: The birth date of Saint Valentine
      is not certain and can vary depending on which Saint Valentine is being referred
      to, as there are multiple saints with this name. However, the most commonly
      recognized Saint Valentine, associated with Valentine''s Day, is believed to
      have lived in the 3rd century AD. The exact birth date is unknown, but it''s
      clear he lived before the 4th century.


      Given these dates:

      - Larry King was born in 1933.

      - Saint Valentine lived in the 3rd century AD, which means he was born sometime
      between 200 AD and 300 AD.


      Comparing the two, it''s evident that Larry King was born much later than Saint
      Valentine.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      let''s break it down into the necessary steps:


      1. **Identify the birth year of Larry King**: Larry King, the American television
      and radio host, was born on November 19, 1933.


      2. **Identify the birth year of Saint Valentine**: The historical figure of
      Saint Valentine is somewhat ambiguous, as there are multiple saints with that
      name. However, the most commonly recognized Saint Valentine, associated with
      Valentine''s Day (February 14th), is believed to have lived in the 3rd century
      AD. The exact dates of his birth and death are not certain, but it''s often
      cited that he was martyred and buried on February 14th, possibly around 269-273
      AD.


      3. **Compare the birth years**: Given that Saint Valentine lived in the 3rd
      century AD and assuming his birth was sometime before his martyrdom (which is
      believed to have occurred between 269-273 AD), we can safely say that Saint
      Valentine was born before the year 269 AD. Larry King, on the other hand, was
      born in 1933 AD.


      4. **Conclusion**: Given that Larry King was born in 1933 and Saint Valentine
      was born before 269 AD, it''s clear that Larry King was born much later than
      Saint Valentine.

      was born later than Louis XIV of France, let''s examine the birth dates of both
      historical figures.


      1. **Rajiv Gandhi''s Birth Date**: Rajiv Gandhi, the sixth Prime Minister of
      India, was born on August 20, 1944.


      2. **Louis XIV of France''s Birth Date**: Louis XIV, known as the Sun King,
      who ruled France, was born on September 5, 1638.


      Given these dates:


      - Rajiv Gandhi was born in 1944.

      - Louis XIV was born in 1638.


      Since 1944 is later than 1638, Rajiv Gandhi was indeed born later than Louis
      XIV of France.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      let''s first find out when each of these historical figures was born.


      1. **Rajiv Gandhi**: He was the sixth Prime Minister of India, serving from
      1984 to 1989. Rajiv Gandhi was born on August 20, 1944.


      2. **Louis XIV of France**: Known as the "Sun King," Louis XIV was a monarch
      of the House of Bourbon who ruled as King of France from 1643 until his death
      in 1715. He was born on September 5, 1638.


      Now, comparing their birth years:


      - Rajiv Gandhi was born in 1944.

      - Louis XIV of France was born in 1638.


      Since 1638 is earlier than 1944, Louis XIV of France was born before Rajiv Gandhi.


      Therefore, the answer to whether Rajiv Gandhi was born later than Louis XIV
      of France is: **YES**.'

      on April 16, 1889.

      2. **Identify the birth year of Alexander Hamilton**: Alexander Hamilton was
      born on January 11, 1755, or 1757 (there is some debate about the exact year,
      but both options are before Chaplin''s birth year).

      3. **Compare the birth years**: Since 1889 (Chaplin''s birth year) is later
      than both 1755 and 1757 (the possible birth years of Hamilton), we can conclude
      that Charlie Chaplin was indeed born later than Alexander Hamilton.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'

      Given these birth years:

      - Piotr I (Peter the Great) was born in 1672.

      Piotr I, the answer is **NO**.'

      let''s first identify the birth years of both John Steinbeck and Mahatma Gandhi.


      1. **Identify John Steinbeck''s birth year**: John Steinbeck was born on February
      27, 1902.

      2. **Identify Mahatma Gandhi''s birth year**: Mahatma Gandhi was born on October
      2, 1869.


      Now, let''s compare these years to determine if John Steinbeck was born later
      than Mahatma Gandhi.


      - Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.

      - John Steinbeck was born in 1902.


      Since 1902 is later than 1869, John Steinbeck was indeed born later than Mahatma
      Gandhi.


      The answer is: **YES**'
