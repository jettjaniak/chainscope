      to be between 1394 and 1404, with 1398 being the most commonly cited year.

      3. **Compare the birth years**: Since 1398 (or any year between 1394 and 1404)

    b640cda7-898f-4063-affd-a59bfb8858f7: 'To answer this question,
      let''s break it down:


      1. **Identify the Birth Date of Saint Valentine**: Saint Valentine''s birth
      date is not precisely known, but it is believed to be in the 3rd century AD,
      with some sources suggesting he lived during the reign of Emperor Claudius II
      (268-270 AD). For simplicity, we can consider his birth to be around 200-250
      AD, keeping in mind that exact dates are not available.


      2. **Identify the Birth Date of Larry King**: Larry King, the American television
      and radio host, was born on November 19, 1933.


      3. **Compare the Birth Dates**: Since Larry King was born in 1933 AD and Saint
      Valentine''s estimated birth is around 200-250 AD, it is clear that Saint Valentine
      was born before Larry King.


      Given these steps, the answer to whether Larry King was born later than Saint
      Valentine is:


      YES'

    f88aa841-b1e6-4fef-aa64-9cdce4ec6a30: 'To answer this question,
      let''s break it down into steps:


      1. **Identify the birth year of Jim Morrison**: Jim Morrison, the lead singer
      of The Doors, was born on December 8, 1943.


      2. **Identify the birth year of Sun Tzu**: Sun Tzu, the ancient Chinese military
      strategist who wrote "The Art of War," is believed to have lived during the
      Eastern Zhou period (771 to 256 BCE). The exact dates of his birth and death
      are not known, but tradition places him in the 6th century BCE, with some estimates
      suggesting he was born around 544 BCE and died around 496 BCE.


      3. **Compare the birth years**: Given that Jim Morrison was born in 1943 CE
      and Sun Tzu is believed to have been born around 544 BCE, it''s clear that Sun
      Tzu was born significantly earlier than Jim Morrison.


      Based on this comparison, the answer to whether Jim Morrison was born later
      than Sun Tzu is **YES**.'
