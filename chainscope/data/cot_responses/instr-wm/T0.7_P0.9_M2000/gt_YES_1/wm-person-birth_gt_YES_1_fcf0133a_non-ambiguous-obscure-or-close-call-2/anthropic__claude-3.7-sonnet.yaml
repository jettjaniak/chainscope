      the birth years of Whitney Houston and Kim Jong-il.


      Step 1: Determine when Whitney Houston was born.

      Whitney Houston was born on August 9, 1963, in Newark, New Jersey.


      Step 2: Determine when Kim Jong-il was born.

      Kim Jong-il was born on February 16, 1941, in the Soviet Union (though North
      Korean propaganda claimed he was born in 1942 in North Korea).


      Step 3: Compare the birth years.

      Whitney Houston (1963) was born after Kim Jong-il (1941).


      NO, Whitney Houston was not born later than Kim Jong-il. She was born earlier
      than him.


      Wait, I made a mistake in my conclusion. Let me correct myself:


      YES, Whitney Houston was born later than Kim Jong-il. Whitney Houston was born
      in 1963, while Kim Jong-il was born in 1941. Since 1963 comes after 1941 chronologically,
      Whitney Houston was born later.'

      Step 1: Determine when Whitney Houston was born.

      Whitney Houston was born on August 9, 1963.


      Step 2: Determine when Kim Jong-il was born.

      Kim Jong-il was born on February 16, 1941 (though North Korean accounts claim
      1942).


      Step 3: Compare the birth years.

      1963 (Whitney Houston) comes after 1941/1942 (Kim Jong-il).


      Therefore, Whitney Houston was born later than Kim Jong-il.


      NO

      Kalam: 1931

      Mussolini: 1883


      Since 1931 comes after 1883, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was born later than Benito
      Mussolini.


      YES'
    e93d01d3-94c0-4d60-a3fa-c8338975fd58: 'I need to determine when A. P. J. Abdul
      Kalam and Benito Mussolini were born, and then compare these dates.


      Step 1: Recall when A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was born.

      A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, the former President of India and renowned scientist,
      was born on October 15, 1931.


      Step 2: Recall when Benito Mussolini was born.

      Benito Mussolini, the fascist dictator of Italy, was born on July 29, 1883.


      Step 3: Compare the two birth dates.

      1931 comes after 1883, meaning Kalam was born later than Mussolini.


      NO, wait, I made an error in my conclusion. The question asks if Kalam was born
      later than Mussolini, and since 1931 is indeed later than 1883, the correct
      answer is:


      YES'

      was born later than Louis XIV of France by finding their birth years.


      Step 1: Identify when Louis XIV of France was born.

      Louis XIV, known as the Sun King, was born on September 5, 1638. He ruled France
      for 72 years from 1643 until his death in 1715.


      Step 2: Identify when Rajiv Gandhi was born.

      Rajiv Gandhi was born on August 20, 1944. He was the former Prime Minister of
      India (1984-1989) and was assassinated in 1991.


      Step 3: Compare the two birth dates.

      Louis XIV: Born in 1638

      1) Jim Morrison was the lead singer of the rock band The Doors. He was born
      on December 8, 1943, and died in 1971.


      2) Sun Tzu was an ancient Chinese military strategist and philosopher, most
      famous for writing "The Art of War." He is believed to have lived during the
      Eastern Zhou period of ancient China, around the late 6th to early 5th century
      BCE (approximately 544-496 BCE).


      3) To compare: Jim Morrison was born in 1943 CE (Common Era), while Sun Tzu
      lived around 500 BCE (Before Common Era).

      millennia.
