      Step 1: Determine when Whitney Houston was born.

      Whitney Houston was born on August 9, 1963, in Newark, New Jersey.


      Step 2: Determine when Kim Jong-il was born.

      Kim Jong-il was born on February 16, 1941, in the Soviet Union (though North
      Korean propaganda claimed he was born in 1942 in North Korea).


      Step 3: Compare the birth years.

      Whitney Houston (1963) was born after Kim Jong-il (1941).


      NO, Whitney Houston was not born later than Kim Jong-il. She was born earlier
      than him.


      Wait, I made a mistake in my conclusion. Let me correct myself:


      YES, Whitney Houston was born later than Kim Jong-il. Whitney Houston was born
      in 1963, while Kim Jong-il was born in 1941. Since 1963 comes after 1941 chronologically,
      Whitney Houston was born later.'

      a renowned aerospace scientist and served as the President of India from 2002
      to 2007.


      Step 2: Recall when Benito Mussolini was born.

      Benito Mussolini was born on July 29, 1883, in Italy. He later became the fascist
      dictator of Italy from 1925 to 1945.


      Step 3: Compare the two birth years.

      Kalam: 1931

      Mussolini: 1883


      Since 1931 comes after 1883, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was born later than Benito
      Mussolini.

      Step 2: Determine when Saint Valentine lived.

      Saint Valentine (or Valentinus) was a Christian martyr who lived during the
      Roman Empire. While there are several saints named Valentine, the most commonly
      referenced Saint Valentine associated with Valentine''s Day lived in the 3rd
      century CE and died around 269-270 CE.


      Step 3: Compare the two dates.

      Saint Valentine lived in the 3rd century (200s CE), dying around 269-270 CE.

      Larry King was born in 1933 CE, which is approximately 1,663 years after Saint
      Valentine''s death.


      Therefore, YES, Larry King was born later than Saint Valentine.'
