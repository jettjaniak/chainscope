      2. Johannes Gutenberg was a German inventor known for introducing the printing
      press to Europe. His date of birth is estimated to be around 1400 (some sources
      say between 1394 and 1404, but 1400 is a commonly accepted approximation).


      Now, compare their birth years:

      - Florence Nightingale: 1820

      - Johannes Gutenberg: ~1400


      Since 1820 is more than 400 years after 1400, Florence Nightingale was indeed
      born later than Johannes Gutenberg.

      1. **Vasco da Gama** was a Portuguese explorer. Historical records suggest he
      was born around **1460** (some sources may say 1469, but most agree it''s around
      1460).


      2. **Anne Boleyn** was the second wife of King Henry VIII of England and the
      mother of Queen Elizabeth I. She was born around **1501** (some sources suggest
      dates between 1501 and 1507, but 1501 is often used as the most credible estimate).


      Now, compare the dates:


      - Vasco da Gama: circa 1460

      - Anne Boleyn: circa 1501


      Since 1501 is clearly later than 1460, it means Anne Boleyn was born after Vasco

      2. Queen Victoria was born on May 24, 1819.


      Now compare the two dates:


      - 1819 (Queen Victoria''s birth year) is later than 1754 (Louis XVI''s birth
      year).


      Therefore, Queen Victoria was born after Louis XVI of France.

    dfc1437d-6106-4285-95af-20bb659fc400: "To answer whether Jim Morrison was born\
      \ later than Sun Tzu, let's analyze the two individuals:\n\n1. **Jim Morrison**:\n\
      \   - Jim Morrison was the lead singer of the rock band The Doors.\n   - He\
      \ was born on December 8, 1943.\n\n2. **Sun Tzu**:\n   - Sun Tzu was a Chinese\
      \ military general, strategist, and philosopher.\n   - He is traditionally believed\
      \ to have lived during the Eastern Zhou period of ancient China.\n   - Estimates\
      \ place his life around the 5th century BCE (approximately 544\u2013496 BCE).\n\
      \nNow, comparing the two:\n- Jim Morrison was born in the 20th century (1943\
      \ CE).\n- Sun Tzu lived in the 5th century BCE, which is over 2,000 years earlier.\n\
      \nTherefore, Jim Morrison was clearly born much later than Sun Tzu.\n\n**Answer:\
      \ YES**."
