      1. Jim Morrison was born on December 8, 1943


      2. Sun Tzu''s exact birth date is not known with certainty, but historians generally
      place him in the late Spring and Autumn Period of ancient China


      3. The Spring and Autumn Period lasted from approximately 771 BC to 476 BC


      4. Sun Tzu is believed to have lived around 544-496 BC


      5. Therefore:

      - Sun Tzu: ~500 BC

      - Jim Morrison: 1943 AD

      - The difference is about 2,400 years


      6. Since 1943 AD comes after 500 BC chronologically, Morrison was born later

      1. Jim Morrison was born on December 8, 1943 in Melbourne, Florida.


      2. Sun Tzu''s exact birth date is not known with certainty, but historians generally
      place his life around 544-496 BCE (Before Common Era).


      3. BCE dates are before year 0, while CE dates (like 1943) are after year 0.


      4. Therefore, Sun Tzu (around 500 BCE) lived approximately 2,400 years before
      Jim Morrison (1943 CE).


      5. Since Sun Tzu lived over two millennia before Morrison, Morrison was clearly
      born later.

      1. Jim Morrison was born in 1943 (December 8, 1943, to be precise)


      2. Sun Tzu lived during the Eastern Zhou period of ancient China

      - Most historians place his life around 544-496 BCE (Before Common Era)

      - Morrison: 1943 CE

      - There''s about 2,400 years between them


      4. Since Morrison was born in 1943 CE, which is much later than 500 BCE...


      YES, Jim Morrison was born later than Sun Tzu.'
