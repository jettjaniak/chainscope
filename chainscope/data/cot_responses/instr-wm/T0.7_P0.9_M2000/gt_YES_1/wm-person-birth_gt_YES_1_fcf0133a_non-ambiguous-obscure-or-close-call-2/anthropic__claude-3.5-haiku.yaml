    7833a9ac-f56a-440a-b5a1-fc74bbde675e: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. Whitney Houston''s birth date:

      - Whitney Houston was born on August 9, 1963


      2. Kim Jong-il''s birth date:

      - Kim Jong-il was born on February 16, 1941


      3. Comparing the two birth dates:

      - 1941 is earlier than 1963

      - This means Kim Jong-il was born before Whitney Houston


      4. Answering the specific question: "Was Whitney Houston born later than Kim
      Jong-il?"

      - Since Kim Jong-il was born in 1941 and Whitney Houston was born in 1963, she
      was indeed born later than him
