      let''s first identify the birth dates of both Whitney Houston and Kim Jong-il.


      1. **Identify Whitney Houston''s birth date**: Whitney Houston was born on August
      9, 1963.

      2. **Identify Kim Jong-il''s birth date**: Kim Jong-il was born on February

      2. **Identify the birth date of Yasser Arafat**: Yasser Arafat was born on August

      let''s first identify the birth dates of both Florence Nightingale and Johannes
      Gutenberg.


      1. **Identify Florence Nightingale''s birth date**: Florence Nightingale was
      born on May 12, 1820.

      2. **Identify Johannes Gutenberg''s birth date**: Johannes Gutenberg was born
      around 1398. The exact date is not known, but it is generally accepted to be
      between 1394 and 1404, with 1398 being the most commonly cited year.


      Now, comparing the two birth dates:


      - Florence Nightingale was born in 1820.

      - Johannes Gutenberg was born around 1398.


      Since 1820 is later than 1398, we can conclude that Florence Nightingale was
      indeed born later than Johannes Gutenberg.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      1. First, we need to identify the birth dates of both Janis Joplin and Margaret
      Thatcher.

      2. Janis Joplin was born on January 19, 1943.

      3. Margaret Thatcher was born on October 13, 1925.

      4. Now, we can compare the birth dates. Since 1943 (Janis Joplin''s birth year)

      Joplin was indeed born later than Margaret Thatcher.

      - A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was born in 1931.

      - Benito Mussolini was born in 1883.


      Since 1931 is later than 1883, we can conclude that A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was
      indeed born later than Benito Mussolini.

      1. **Identify the birth date of William Wallace**: William Wallace was born
      around 1270. The exact date is unknown, but it is generally believed to be in
      the year 1270.

      2. **Identify the birth date of Piotr I**: Piotr I, also known as Peter the

      we need to compare the birth dates of Luciano Pavarotti and Genghis Khan.


      1. **Identify the birth date of Luciano Pavarotti**: Luciano Pavarotti was born
      on October 12, 1935.

      2. **Identify the birth date of Genghis Khan**: Genghis Khan was born in 1162,
      but the exact date is unknown. Historians estimate his birth year to be between
      1155 and 1167, with 1162 being the most commonly accepted date.

      3. **Compare the birth dates**: Luciano Pavarotti was born in 1935, while Genghis
      Khan was born around 1162. Since 1935 is much later than 1162, Luciano Pavarotti
      was indeed born later than Genghis Khan.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      - T. S. Eliot was born in 1888.

      - Ludwig van Beethoven was born in 1770.


      Since 1888 is later than 1770, we can conclude that T. S. Eliot was indeed born
      later than Ludwig van Beethoven.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      Now, comparing the two birth dates:


      - Jim Morrison was born in 1943.
