      was indeed born later than Kim Jong-il.


      Given these steps, the answer to whether Whitney Houston was born later than
      Kim Jong-il is:

      1978.

      2. **Identify George Orwell''s birth date**: George Orwell, whose real name
      was Eric Arthur Blair, was born on June 25, 1903.


      Now, comparing the two birth dates:


      - Kobe Bryant was born in 1978.

      - George Orwell was born in 1903.


      Since 1978 is later than 1903, we can conclude that Kobe Bryant was indeed born
      later than George Orwell.

      van Gogh.


      1. **Identify Robert F. Kennedy''s birth date**: Robert F. Kennedy was born
      on November 20, 1925.

      2. **Identify Vincent van Gogh''s birth date**: Vincent van Gogh was born on
      March 30, 1853.


      Now, comparing the two birth dates:


      - Robert F. Kennedy was born in 1925.

      - Vincent van Gogh was born in 1853.


      Since 1925 is later than 1853, we can conclude that Robert F. Kennedy was indeed
      born later than Vincent van Gogh.
