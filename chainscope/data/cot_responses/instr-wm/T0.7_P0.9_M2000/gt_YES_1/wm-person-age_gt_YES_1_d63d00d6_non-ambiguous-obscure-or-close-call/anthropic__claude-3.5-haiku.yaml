      2. Determine Sitting Bull''s lifespan:

      - Sitting Bull was a Native American leader

      1. First, determine when Pablo Picasso lived:

      - Pablo Picasso was born on October 25, 1881

      - He died on April 8, 1973

      - So he lived from 1881 to 1973, which is 91 years


      2. Next, determine when Moses lived:

      - Moses lived during the biblical period, around 1300-1200 BCE

      - The exact dates are uncertain, but biblical scholars generally place his lifespan
      around 1300-1200 BCE

      - According to biblical accounts, Moses died at 120 years old

      1. First, let''s determine when Ferdinand Magellan lived:

      - Ferdinand Magellan was a Portuguese explorer who lived from 1480 to 1521

      - He died relatively young (around 41 years old) during a battle in the Philippines


      2. Now, let''s look at Akira Kurosawa''s lifespan:

      - Akira Kurosawa was a famous Japanese film director

      - He lived from 1910 to 1998

      - He died at the age of 88


      3. Comparing their lifespans:

      - Magellan lived from 1480 to 1521 (41 years)

      - Kurosawa lived from 1910 to 1998 (88 years)

      - Kurosawa lived much later in history and for a much longer time


      4. Therefore, Akira Kurosawa definitely lived longer than Ferdinand Magellan.
