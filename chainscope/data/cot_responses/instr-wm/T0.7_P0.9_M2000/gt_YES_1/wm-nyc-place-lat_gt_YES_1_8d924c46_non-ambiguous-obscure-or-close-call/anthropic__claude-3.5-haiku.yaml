    ff3266b8-f7b8-47ef-9ee6-8a30fdb37e2b: 'Let''s solve this step by step:


      1. First, let''s locate BRONX ZOO - ADMIN SOUTH:

      - This is located in the Bronx borough, which is in the northern part of New
      York City


      2. Next, let''s locate ELLIS ISLAND NATIONAL MONUMENT:

      - Ellis Island is located in New York Harbor, south of Manhattan

      - It is technically closer to New Jersey than to Manhattan


      3. Comparing their geographical positions:

      - The Bronx is north of Manhattan

      - Ellis Island is south of Manhattan

      - Therefore, the Bronx Zoo is definitively north of Ellis Island


      4. Checking the specific locations:

      - Bronx Zoo is in the northern part of NYC

      - Ellis Island is in the southern part of NYC


      Therefore, the answer is: YES, BRONX ZOO - ADMIN SOUTH is located north of ELLIS
