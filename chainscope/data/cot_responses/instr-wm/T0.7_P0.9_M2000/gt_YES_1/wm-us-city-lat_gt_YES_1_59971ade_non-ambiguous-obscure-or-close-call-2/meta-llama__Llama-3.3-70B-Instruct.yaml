      (California) are the two cities in question.

      2. **Understand geographical directions**: "North of" means that the city in
      question (Seattle) would be located above Los Angeles on a map, considering
      the standard orientation where north is up.

      3. **Consider the general geography of the United States**: Washington state

      4. **Specific city locations**: Seattle is a city in the state of Washington,
      and Los Angeles is a city in the state of California.

      5. **Compare the latitudes**: Without needing the exact latitudes, it''s common
      knowledge that Washington state is north of California. Thus, any city in Washington,
      including Seattle, would be north of any city in California, including Los Angeles.
