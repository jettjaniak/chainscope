      part of the United States, which is generally considered to be in the southern
      part of the country. Colorado, on the other hand, is located in the western

      3. **Latitude comparison**: Without needing the exact latitudes, it''s common
      knowledge that states in the northern part of the U.S. are north of those in
      the southern part. Given Colorado''s position relative to Florida, it is logical

      \ **General Geographic Knowledge**: Washington state is generally known to be\
      \ located in the Pacific Northwest, which is in the northern part of the United\
      \ States. California, where Los Angeles is located, is also on the West Coast\
      \ but is situated south of Washington.\n\n3. **Latitude Comparison**: A more\
      \ precise way to determine the north-south relationship between two cities is\
      \ by comparing their latitudes. Cities located at higher latitudes are closer\
      \ to the North Pole and are thus north of cities at lower latitudes.\n\n4. **Specific\
      \ Latitudes**:\n   - Seattle, WA has a latitude of approximately 47.6067\xB0\
      \ N.\n   - Los Angeles, CA has a latitude of approximately 34.0522\xB0 N.\n\n\
      5. **Comparison**: Since 47.6067\xB0 N (Seattle) is greater than 34.0522\xB0\
      \ N (Los Angeles), Seattle is located at a higher latitude than Los Angeles.\n\
      \n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison of latitudes, Seattle, WA is indeed\
      \ located north of Los Angeles, CA.\n\nThe answer is: **YES**"

      (California) are the two cities in question.

      2. **Understand geographical directions**: "North of" means that the city in
      question (Seattle) would be located above Los Angeles on a map, considering
      the standard orientation where north is up.

      3. **Consider the general geography of the United States**: Washington state

      4. **Specific city locations**: Seattle is a city in the state of Washington,
      and Los Angeles is a city in the state of California.

      5. **Compare the latitudes**: Without needing the exact latitudes, it''s common
      knowledge that Washington state is north of California. Thus, any city in Washington,
      including Seattle, would be north of any city in California, including Los Angeles.
