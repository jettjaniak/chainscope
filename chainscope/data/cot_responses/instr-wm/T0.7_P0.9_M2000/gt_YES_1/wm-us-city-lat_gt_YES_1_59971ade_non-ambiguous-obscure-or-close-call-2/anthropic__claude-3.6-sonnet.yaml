      \ me recall the approximate latitudes:\n- Portland, OR is in the Pacific Northwest,\
      \ near the Washington state border\n- Queens, NY is one of NYC's boroughs, on\
      \ Long Island\n\n2. Looking up the specific latitudes:\n- Portland, OR: approximately\
      \ 45.5\xB0 N\n- Queens, NY: approximately 40.7\xB0 N\n\n3. Comparing the numbers:\n\
      - 45.5\xB0 is greater than 40.7\xB0\n- A higher number for latitude in the Northern\
      \ hemisphere means further north\n\n4. Therefore, Portland is further north\
      \ than Queens by about 5 degrees of latitude\n\nAnswer: YES"
