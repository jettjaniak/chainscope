      1. Punjab is a region/state in India, while Stockholm is a city in Sweden.


      2. Punjab is a large region with multiple cities and a significant population:

      - Punjab, India has around 30 million people

      - It covers a large geographical area with multiple cities and rural regions


      3. Stockholm, in contrast, is a single city:

      - Stockholm city has around 935,000 people

      - The Stockholm metropolitan area has about 2.4 million people


      4. Comparing the populations:

      - Punjab (region): ~30 million

      - Stockholm (city): ~0.9 million

      - Stockholm (metro area): ~2.4 million


      5. Even comparing the smallest population figure for Punjab (30 million) against
      the largest population figure for Stockholm (2.4 million), Punjab is significantly
      more populous.


      Therefore, the answer is: YES, Punjab is more populous than Stockholm.'

      - Long Island is a large island in New York State, USA

      - It includes parts of New York City (Brooklyn and Queens) and extends east
      into Suffolk County

      - The entire Long Island population is approximately 7.6 million people


      2. Now, let''s look at Manchester city centre:

      - Manchester is a city in the United Kingdom

      - Its city centre is much smaller in population

      - The population of Manchester city centre itself is likely only around 30,000-50,000
      people


      3. Comparing the populations:

      - Long Island (7.6 million) is vastly more populous than Manchester city centre
      (30,000-50,000)


      4. Therefore, the answer is:


      YES'
