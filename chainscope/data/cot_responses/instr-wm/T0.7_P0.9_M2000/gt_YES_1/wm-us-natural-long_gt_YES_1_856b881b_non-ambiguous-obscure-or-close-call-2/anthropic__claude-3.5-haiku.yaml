    0529ad80-17ee-4fe4-997f-bd62b0e6cf8d: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. Lake\
      \ Erie is located in the northeastern part of Ohio, bordering several states\
      \ including Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and Michigan.\n\n2. The Teton Range\
      \ is a mountain range located in northwestern Wyoming, primarily within Grand\
      \ Teton National Park.\n\n3. To determine if Lake Erie is east of the Teton\
      \ Range, I'll compare their geographical locations:\n   - Lake Erie is in the\
      \ eastern United States\n   - The Teton Range is in the western United States\n\
      \n4. More specifically:\n   - Lake Erie's longitude is around 81-83 degrees\
      \ West\n   - The Teton Range's longitude is around 110-111 degrees West\n\n\
      5. Since Lake Erie is much further east compared to the Teton Range, it is indeed\
      \ east of the Teton Range.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: YES."
