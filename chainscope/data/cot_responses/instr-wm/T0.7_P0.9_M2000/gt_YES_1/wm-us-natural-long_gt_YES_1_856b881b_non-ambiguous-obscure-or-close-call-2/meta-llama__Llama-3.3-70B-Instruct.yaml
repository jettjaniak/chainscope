    324f8ccd-20b5-489e-a861-1772123cf615: 'To answer this question,
      let''s break it down step by step:


      1. **Identify the locations**: Lake Erie is located in the state of Ohio (OH),
      and the Teton Range is in the state of Wyoming (WY).


      2. **Understand the geography**: Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, situated
      in the northeastern part of the United States. The Teton Range, part of the
      Rocky Mountains, is located in the northwestern United States.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Ohio, where Lake Erie is located, is generally
      considered to be in the eastern part of the United States. Wyoming, where the
      Teton Range is located, is considered to be in the western part of the United
      States.


      4. **Determine the relative positions**: Given that Ohio is east and Wyoming
      is west, any location in Ohio, including Lake Erie, would be east of any location
      in Wyoming, including the Teton Range.


      Therefore, based on the relative positions of Ohio and Wyoming in the United
      States, Lake Erie, OH is indeed located east of the Teton Range, WY.


      The answer is: **YES**'

      we need to determine the relative locations of Lake Erie, Ohio, and the Teton
      Range, Wyoming.


      1. **Identify the general location of Lake Erie, OH**: Lake Erie is one of the
      Great Lakes and is located in the northeastern part of the United States. Specifically,
      it borders the state of Ohio to the south.


      2. **Identify the general location of Teton Range, WY**: The Teton Range is
      part of the Rocky Mountains and is located in the northwestern United States,
      specifically in the state of Wyoming, near the border with Idaho.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Knowing that the United States is generally divided
      into east and west by the Mississippi River, with everything to the east of
      it considered "east" and everything to the west considered "west," we can place
      Lake Erie (Ohio) in the eastern United States and the Teton Range (Wyoming)
      in the western United States.


      4. **Determine the relative east-west position**: Given that Lake Erie is in
      the eastern United States and the Teton Range is in the western United States,
      Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range.
