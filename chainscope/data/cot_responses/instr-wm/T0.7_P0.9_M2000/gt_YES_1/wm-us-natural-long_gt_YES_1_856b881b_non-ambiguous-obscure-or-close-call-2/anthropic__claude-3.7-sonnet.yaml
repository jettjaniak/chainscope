      positions of Lake Erie, OH and the Teton Range, WY.


      Step 1: Identify the locations.

      - Lake Erie borders Ohio on its northern edge, in the northeastern part of the
      United States.

      - The Teton Range is located in western Wyoming, near the Idaho border.


      Step 2: Consider their positions relative to U.S. geography.

      - Ohio is in the eastern half of the United States, specifically in the Midwest/Great
      Lakes region.

      - Wyoming is in the western half of the United States, in the Rocky Mountain
      region.


      Step 3: Compare their approximate longitudes.

      - Lake Erie and Ohio are much further east in the country than Wyoming.

      - The Teton Range, being in western Wyoming, is even further west.


      Step 4: Make the east-west determination.

      - Since Lake Erie is in the eastern part of the country and the Teton Range
      is in the western part, Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range.


      YES'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, located in the northeastern United States,
      bordering Ohio (OH) among other states.

      - The Teton Range is a mountain range in Wyoming (WY), located in the western
      United States.


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on the US map.

      - Ohio is in the eastern half of the continental United States.

      - Wyoming is in the western half of the continental United States.


      Step 3: Compare their east-west positions.

      - States in the eastern US (like Ohio) are east of states in the western US
      (like Wyoming).

      - Therefore, Lake Erie, which borders Ohio, is east of the Teton Range in Wyoming.


      YES, Lake Erie, OH is located east of Teton Range, WY.'

      Step 1: Identify the locations of both places.

      - Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, located in the northeastern United States.
      It borders Ohio (OH) on its southern shore.

      - The Teton Range is a mountain range located in western Wyoming (WY).


      Step 2: Consider their relative positions on the US map.

      - The United States generally has states arranged from west to east as you move
      from the Pacific Ocean toward the Atlantic Ocean.

      - Wyoming is in the western part of the United States.

      - Ohio is in the eastern part of the United States.


      Step 3: Compare their specific east-west positioning.

      - Wyoming, where the Teton Range is located, is significantly west of Ohio,
      where Lake Erie borders.

      - Lake Erie is therefore east of the Teton Range.
