    1d340aff-8d6a-4f6e-98fd-5c5052d789f0: "<think>Okay, so I need to figure out if\
      \ Lake Erie in Ohio is located east of the Teton Range in Wyoming. Hmm, let\
      \ me start by recalling some basic geography. I know that Lake Erie is one of\
      \ the Great Lakes, right? It's the fourth one if you go from east to west, or\
      \ maybe the southernmost. Ohio is a state in the Midwest, near the Great Lakes\
      \ region. Then the Teton Range is in Wyoming, which is more towards the western\
      \ part of the US. \n\nWait, but I need to compare their east-west positions.\
      \ Let me visualize a map of the United States. The Teton Range is part of the\
      \ Rocky Mountains, which run through Wyoming. Wyoming is a state in the Mountain\
      \ West, so pretty far west. Lake Erie is on the border of Ohio and Pennsylvania,\
      \ but also touches Michigan and New York, I think. So Ohio is further east compared\
      \ to Wyoming.\n\nBut to be sure, maybe I can think about the approximate longitudes.\
      \ Longitude measures east-west position. Places with higher west longitude numbers\
      \ are further west. Let me try to remember or estimate. For example, the Teton\
      \ Range is in western Wyoming. Let's say the longitude might be around -110\
      \ degrees or so. Lake Erie's longitude\u2014well, Ohio's longitude is around\
      \ -82 or -83 degrees. So if the Teton Range is at -110 and Lake Erie is at -82,\
      \ then Lake Erie is east because -82 is east of -110. Wait, longitude west of\
      \ the prime meridian is measured as negative, so a smaller negative number (like\
      \ -82) is actually further east than a larger negative number like -110. So\
      \ yes, Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range. \n\nBut maybe I should double-check.\
      \ Let me think of cities. For example, Cleveland, Ohio is on Lake Erie. Its\
      \ longitude is approximately 81.67 degrees West. Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which\
      \ is near the Tetons, is around -110.76 degrees West. Comparing those, Cleveland\
      \ is around 81.7\xB0W, and Jackson Hole is 110.8\xB0W. Since 81.7 is less than\
      \ 110.8 in terms of west longitude (but both are west, so negative degrees),\
      \ Cleveland (Lake Erie) is east of the Tetons. So the answer should be YES,\
      \ Lake Erie, OH is located east of the Teton Range, WY.\n</think>To determine\
      \ if Lake Erie, OH is east of the Teton Range, WY:  \n1. **Locations**: Lake\
      \ Erie lies in the eastern Great Lakes region, bordering Ohio. The Teton Range\
      \ is in western Wyoming, part of the Rocky Mountains.  \n2. **Longitudes**:\
      \  \n   - Teton Range (approx. -110\xB0W)  \n   - Lake Erie (approx. -82\xB0\
      W)  \n   Lower west longitude values (closer to 0\xB0) indicate positions further\
      \ east.  \n3. **Comparison**: -82\xB0W (Lake Erie) is east of -110\xB0W (Teton\
      \ Range).  \n\n**ANSWER**: YES"
    28bdab73-b8ce-40b6-be1b-3f7b40993bde: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Lake Erie in Ohio is located east of the Teton Range in Wyoming. Hmm.\
      \ I need to figure out the geographical positions of both places.\n\nFirst,\
      \ I remember that Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes. It's the fourth largest\
      \ by surface area, and it's between the U.S. and Canada. Ohio borders Lake Erie\
      \ to the south, so Lake Erie is in the northern part of Ohio. Now, where is\
      \ the Teton Range? The Teton Range is in Wyoming, part of the Rocky Mountains.\
      \ Specifically, Grand Teton National Park is there. Wyoming is in the western\
      \ part of the U.S., right? So the Tetons are in the west, and Lake Erie is in\
      \ the Midwest or Northeast?\n\nWait, Ohio is in the Midwest, but more towards\
      \ the east. Let me think about the longitude. The United States spans from about\
      \ 67 degrees west (east coast) to around 125 degrees west (west coast). Ohio\
      \ is around 80 to 84 degrees west longitude. For example, Cleveland, Ohio, is\
      \ at about 81.7 degrees west. The Teton Range in Wyoming\u2014where exactly\
      \ is that? Jackson Hole is near the Tetons. Let me recall that Wyoming's longitude\
      \ is further west. Maybe around 110 degrees west? For instance, Jackson, WY\
      \ is approximately 110.76 degrees west. \n\nSo longitude-wise, the further west\
      \ you go, the higher the number. So a place at 110\xB0W is west of a place at\
      \ 80\xB0W. Therefore, Lake Erie in Ohio (around 81\xB0W) is east of the Teton\
      \ Range in Wyoming (around 110\xB0W). So yes, Lake Erie is east of the Teton\
      \ Range.\n</think>YES  \nLake Erie, OH is located east of the Teton Range, WY.\
      \ Lake Erie lies in the Midwest/Northeast at approximately 81\xB0W longitude,\
      \ while the Teton Range in Wyoming is around 110\xB0W longitude. Since lower\
      \ longitude values are farther east, Lake Erie is indeed east of the Teton Range."
    5e66bf97-b0d2-46ff-af87-f815ddf39128: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Lake Erie in Ohio is located east of the Teton Range in Wyoming. Hmm.\
      \ I need to figure out the geographical locations of both places and determine\
      \ their relative positions. \n\nFirst, I know Lake Erie is one of the Great\
      \ Lakes. It borders Ohio on its southern shore, right? So Lake Erie is in the\
      \ northeastern part of the United States, near states like Ohio, Pennsylvania,\
      \ New York, and Michigan. The city of Cleveland, for example, is on Lake Erie\
      \ in Ohio. \n\nThen, the Teton Range is in Wyoming. I remember that the Tetons\
      \ are part of the Rocky Mountains. Wyoming is a western state, quite a bit to\
      \ the west of the Midwest where Ohio is. The Teton Range is near Idaho as well,\
      \ I think. Jackson Hole and Grand Teton National Park are there. \n\nNow, I\
      \ need to figure out if Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range. So, comparing\
      \ their longitudes. Generally, places further east have higher longitude values\
      \ if we're using the western hemisphere where longitudes are negative. Wait,\
      \ no, actually in the US, as you go east, longitude decreases? Wait, no. The\
      \ prime meridian is 0\xB0, and longitude increases going east from there up\
      \ to 180\xB0, but in the western hemisphere (like the Americas), longitude is\
      \ measured west from the prime meridian, so it's negative degrees. For example,\
      \ New York is around 74\xB0W, and Los Angeles is around 118\xB0W. So the further\
      \ east a location is, the smaller (less negative) its longitude. \n\nSo if Lake\
      \ Erie is east of the Teton Range, then Lake Erie's longitude should be less\
      \ negative (closer to zero) than that of the Teton Range. \n\nLet me try to\
      \ find approximate longitudes. Lake Erie's westernmost point is near Toledo,\
      \ Ohio, which is around 83.5\xB0W. The eastern end is near Buffalo, New York,\
      \ which is about 78.8\xB0W. So Lake Erie spans roughly from 78.8\xB0W to 83.5\xB0\
      W longitude. \n\nThe Teton Range in Wyoming\u2014let's take Jackson Hole as\
      \ a reference point, which is near the Tetons. Jackson, WY is approximately\
      \ 110.76\xB0W. The Teton Range itself runs north-south, so perhaps the longitude\
      \ is around 110\xB0W to 111\xB0W. \n\nComparing the two, Lake Erie's longitude\
      \ (ranging from approx 78.8\xB0W to 83.5\xB0W) is east of 110\xB0W. Because\
      \ 78.8\xB0W is much less than 110\xB0W (since they're both west longitude, the\
      \ smaller number is more east). So yes, Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range.\
      \ \n\nWait, but wait, Lake Erie is in the eastern part of the US, while the\
      \ Teton Range is in the west. So generally, the answer would be yes. But just\
      \ to confirm, even the westernmost point of Lake Erie (83.5\xB0W) is still east\
      \ of the Teton's easternmost longitude (maybe around 110\xB0W). But 83.5 is\
      \ less than 110. Wait, longitude west coordinates: lower numbers are more east.\
      \ So 83.5\xB0W is east of 110\xB0W. So even the western part of Lake Erie is\
      \ east of the Teton Range. \n\nTherefore, yes, Lake Erie, OH is located east\
      \ of the Teton Range, WY.\n</think>YES \n\nLake Erie, located in the northeastern\
      \ U.S., spans longitudes from approximately 78.8\xB0W to 83.5\xB0W. The Teton\
      \ Range in Wyoming lies further west, with longitudes around 110\xB0W to 111\xB0\
      W. Since lower (less negative) western longitudes indicate more easterly positions,\
      \ even the westernmost point of Lake Erie (83.5\xB0W) is east of the Teton Range.\
      \ Thus, Lake Erie, OH, is east of the Teton Range, WY."
    7251602a-502f-4cb1-bbf0-2340fe08f350: "<think>Alright, let's figure out if Lake\
      \ Erie in Ohio is east of the Teton Range in Wyoming. Hmm, okay, first I need\
      \ to recall where both of these places are located in the United States. \n\n\
      Starting with Lake Erie: I know it's one of the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes\
      \ are in the northern part of the US, near the border with Canada. Lake Erie\
      \ specifically is the fourth largest by surface area and the southernmost of\
      \ the Great Lakes. Ohio borders Lake Erie to the south, so the part of the lake\
      \ that's in Ohio would be along its southern shore.\n\nNow, the Teton Range\
      \ in Wyoming. Wyoming is a state in the western US, part of the Mountain West\
      \ region. The Teton Range is a mountain range in northwestern Wyoming, near\
      \ the border with Idaho. It's part of the Rocky Mountains and includes Grand\
      \ Teton, which is the highest peak in the range. The nearby town is Jackson\
      \ Hole, and the range is west of the state's center.\n\nSo, the question is\
      \ whether Lake Erie, OH (Ohio) is east of the Teton Range, WY. To compare their\
      \ longitudinal positions. East and west are determined by longitude, with places\
      \ having higher longitude values being further east. Wait, no, actually longitude\
      \ increases going east from the prime meridian, but in the US, all longitudes\
      \ are west, so higher longitude numbers (more west) would be further west. Wait,\
      \ no\u2014longitude is measured from 0\xB0 at the prime meridian (Greenwich,\
      \ UK), going east to 180\xB0E and west to 180\xB0W. But in the US, all locations\
      \ are in the western hemisphere, so their longitudes are west, meaning they're\
      \ west of the prime meridian. So, a place with a smaller longitude (closer to\
      \ 0\xB0) is further east, and a larger longitude (closer to 180\xB0) is further\
      \ west.\n\nSo, to determine if Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range, I need\
      \ to compare their approximate longitudes.\n\nLet me get the approximate longitude\
      \ for both. \n\nFirst, Lake Erie in Ohio: The state of Ohio is in the eastern\
      \ part of the US. The longitude of Lake Erie, specifically the part near Ohio,\
      \ would be around 82 degrees west, maybe? For example, Cleveland, Ohio is on\
      \ Lake Erie, and its longitude is approximately 81.68\xB0W. Let me confirm:\
      \ Cleveland's coordinates are roughly 41.48\xB0N, 81.67\xB0W. So the longitude\
      \ is about 81.7\xB0W.\n\nNow, the Teton Range in Wyoming: Let's take Jackson,\
      \ Wyoming, which is near the Teton Range. Jackson's coordinates are approximately\
      \ 43.48\xB0N, 110.76\xB0W. So the longitude is around 110.8\xB0W. However, the\
      \ Teton Range itself might be a bit west of Jackson. Let me check the coordinates\
      \ for the Teton Range. Grand Teton's summit is at about 43.74\xB0N, 110.80\xB0\
      W. So longitude around 110.8\xB0W.\n\nComparing the two: Lake Erie's longitude\
      \ is about 81.7\xB0W, and Teton Range is about 110.8\xB0W. Since lower longitude\
      \ (more eastern) is east, Lake Erie at 81.7\xB0W is east of 110.8\xB0W. Therefore,\
      \ yes, Lake Erie in Ohio is east of the Teton Range in Wyoming.\n\nWait a second,\
      \ just to make sure I'm not mixing up east and west. The prime meridian is 0\xB0\
      , and as you go west, the longitude increases in the west direction. So, 81\xB0\
      W is 81 degrees west of the prime meridian, and 110\xB0W is further west. So,\
      \ 81\xB0W is east of 110\xB0W. For example, New York is around 74\xB0W, which\
      \ is east of Chicago at 87\xB0W. So yes, the lower the longitude (in the western\
      \ hemisphere), the more eastward the location. Therefore, Lake Erie (81.7\xB0\
      W) is east of Teton Range (110.8\xB0W). So the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES\
      \  \nLake Erie in Ohio is located at approximately 81.7\xB0W longitude, while\
      \ the Teton Range in Wyoming is around 110.8\xB0W. Since lower longitude values\
      \ (closer to the prime meridian) indicate positions further east, Lake Erie\
      \ is indeed east of the Teton Range."
    8cb933e4-0e03-408b-b1c7-f258a889ce18: "<think>Okay, let's figure out if Lake Erie\
      \ in Ohio is east of the Teton Range in Wyoming. First, I need to recall where\
      \ both of these places are located in the United States. \n\nStarting with Lake\
      \ Erie: I know it's one of the Great Lakes, and it's the fourth largest by surface\
      \ area. Ohio borders Lake Erie to the south, so the lake is in the northern\
      \ part of Ohio. Geographically, the Great Lakes are in the northeastern part\
      \ of the United States, near the Canadian border.\n\nNow, the Teton Range in\
      \ Wyoming: The Tetons are a mountain range in western Wyoming, part of the Rocky\
      \ Mountains. They're famous for Grand Teton National Park. Wyoming is a western\
      \ state, so the Teton Range is definitely in the western part of the US.\n\n\
      Next, I need to compare their longitudinal positions. Since the question is\
      \ about east vs. west, longitude is key. Generally, locations further east have\
      \ higher eastern longitude values (or lower western longitude, depending on\
      \ how it's measured). But in the US, as you move from east to west, the longitude\
      \ changes from around 70\xB0W on the East Coast to about 125\xB0W on the West\
      \ Coast. \n\nLake Erie's approximate longitude: Let's think of a major city\
      \ near Lake Erie in Ohio, like Cleveland. Cleveland, OH is at approximately\
      \ 81.7\xB0W longitude. The lake itself spans from about 82.5\xB0W at its western\
      \ end (near Toledo, OH) to around 78.9\xB0W at the eastern end (near Buffalo,\
      \ NY). So the entire Lake Erie is roughly between 78.9\xB0W and 82.5\xB0W.\n\
      \nTeton Range's longitude: The Teton Range is in northwestern Wyoming. Jackson\
      \ Hole, a valley near the Tetons, is around 110.7\xB0W. The Teton Range itself\
      \ would be slightly west of there, maybe around 111\xB0W to 113\xB0W. For example,\
      \ Grand Teton's summit is at approximately 110.8\xB0W. So the range is roughly\
      \ around 110\xB0W to 113\xB0W longitude.\n\nComparing the two: Lake Erie's westernmost\
      \ point is at 82.5\xB0W, and the Teton Range is around 110\xB0W to 113\xB0W.\
      \ Since longitude decreases as you go west (from 0\xB0 at the prime meridian\
      \ going west to 180\xB0), a lower number (e.g., 82\xB0W) is east of a higher\
      \ number (e.g., 110\xB0W). So 82.5\xB0W is east of 110\xB0W. Therefore, Lake\
      \ Erie, even at its westernmost point, is significantly east of the Teton Range.\n\
      \nSo the answer is YES. Lake Erie, OH is located east of the Teton Range, WY.\n\
      </think>YES  \nLake Erie, OH is east of the Teton Range, WY. Lake Erie spans\
      \ approximately 78.9\xB0W to 82.5\xB0W longitude, while the Teton Range in Wyoming\
      \ is located around 110\xB0W to 113\xB0W longitude. Since lower longitude values\
      \ (e.g., 82.5\xB0W) are east of higher values (e.g., 110\xB0W), Lake Erie lies\
      \ significantly east of the Teton Range."

      \ of the Great Lakes. Ohio borders Lake Erie to its south, so the part of Lake\
      \ Erie that's in Ohio would be along the state's northern border. I remember\
      \ that the Great Lakes are in the northeastern part of the United States, near\
      \ Canada.\n\nThen there's the Teton Range in Wyoming. The Tetons are a mountain\
      \ range in the western part of Wyoming, part of the Rocky Mountains. I think\
      \ they're near Grand Teton National Park and Jackson Hole. Wyoming is a state\
      \ in the western US, so the Teton Range is definitely in the West.\n\nNow, to\
      \ determine if Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range, I need to compare their\

      \ east a place is, the higher its longitude (wait, no, longitude increases going\
      \ east from the prime meridian up to 180\xB0, but in the US, all longitudes\
      \ are west of the prime meridian, so they're negative numbers. So a location\
      \ with a less negative longitude is more east. For example, if Lake Erie is\
      \ at, say, -82 degrees longitude and the Tetons are at -110 degrees, then Lake\
      \ Erie would be east because -82 is greater (less west) than -110.)\n\nLet me\
      \ check approximate longitudes. Lake Erie's westernmost point is near Detroit,\
      \ Michigan, which is around 83 degrees west longitude (-83\xB0). The eastern\
      \ end is near Buffalo, New York, which is about -78.8\xB0. The Teton Range's\
      \ longitude is roughly around -110\xB0 to -111\xB0 West. For example, Jackson\

      \ Even the westernmost part of Lake Erie (-83\xB0) is much further east than\
      \ the Teton Range (-110\xB0). So, yes, Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range.\n\
      </think>YES  \nTo determine if Lake Erie, OH is east of the Teton Range, WY:\
      \  \n1. **Lake Erie** is in the northeastern U.S., with its western edge near\

      \ easterly at -83\xB0) is east of the Teton Range (more westerly at -110\xB0\
      ).  \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    d943aebb-2d8f-469c-8ca8-daddd0f60b47: "<think>Okay, let me try to figure this\
      \ out. The question is whether Lake Erie in Ohio is located east of the Teton\
      \ Range in Wyoming. Hmm, I need to determine the positions of these two landmarks\
      \ relative to each other.\n\nFirst, I should recall where each of these places\
      \ is. Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes. I know the Great Lakes are in the\
      \ northeastern part of the United States, bordering Canada. Specifically, Lake\
      \ Erie is between the states of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York,\
      \ with the Canadian province of Ontario on the other side. So Ohio's northern\
      \ border is along Lake Erie. \n\nThen the Teton Range in Wyoming. The Tetons\
      \ are part of the Rocky Mountains, right? Wyoming is a western state, so the\
      \ Teton Range is in the western part of the US. The Grand Teton National Park\
      \ is there, I think. So Wyoming is pretty far west, maybe near states like Idaho\
      \ and Montana.\n\nNow, to compare their longitude. Since the US spans from east\
      \ to west, longitude determines east-west positioning. Places further east have\
      \ higher longitude if we're talking east of the prime meridian? Wait, no. Actually,\
      \ in the US, which is west of the prime meridian, longitude is measured in degrees\
      \ west. So a higher longitude (more west) would mean further west. Wait, no,\
      \ longitude east increases to the east, and west increases to the west. So the\
      \ prime meridian is 0, and moving east, it's positive degrees east, moving west,\
      \ positive degrees west. But in the US, all longitudes are west, so they are\
      \ measured as degrees west, which would mean higher numbers as you go west.\
      \ For example, New York is around 74\xB0W, and Wyoming might be around 110\xB0\
      W. So if Lake Erie is in Ohio, which is in the eastern part of the US, its longitude\

      \ longitude.\n\nLet me double-check approximate longitudes. Lake Erie's eastern\
      \ end is near Buffalo, NY, which is around 78.8\xB0W. The western end of Lake\
      \ Erie is near Toledo, Ohio, which is around 83.5\xB0W. The Teton Range in Wyoming\
      \ is near Jackson Hole, which is about 110.7\xB0W. Comparing those: 83.5\xB0\
      W versus 110.7\xB0W. Since lower longitude (closer to 0) means further east,\
      \ Lake Erie's longitude is east of the Teton Range. So yes, Lake Erie is east\
      \ of the Teton Range.</think>YES. To determine if Lake Erie, OH is east of the\
      \ Teton Range, WY:  \n1. **Locations**: Lake Erie lies in the northeastern U.S.,\

      \ Comparison**:  \n   - Lake Erie spans roughly **78.8\xB0W** (eastern end)\
      \ to **83.5\xB0W** (western end).  \n   - The Teton Range is near **110.7\xB0\
      W**.  \n3. **Conclusion**: Lower longitude values (closer to 0\xB0) are farther\

    e36de255-2909-4011-976c-9eb3305ba09e: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Lake Erie in Ohio is east of the Teton Range in Wyoming. Hmm, I need\
      \ to figure out their geographical locations relative to each other. \n\nFirst,\
      \ I know Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes. It's located on the border between\
      \ the United States and Canada, with parts belonging to Ohio, Pennsylvania,\
      \ New York, and Michigan. But the question specifies Lake Erie, OH, so I guess\
      \ the part in Ohio. Now, where is Ohio? It's in the Midwestern part of the US,\
      \ sort of the eastern part of the Midwest.\n\nThen the Teton Range is in Wyoming.\
      \ Wyoming is a western state, part of the Mountain West region. The Teton Range\
      \ is in the northwest part of Wyoming, near Idaho. So the Tetons are definitely\
      \ in the western US.\n\nNow, comparing east and west positions. Generally, the\
      \ eastern US is to the east of the western states. So Ohio is further east than\
      \ Wyoming. Therefore, Lake Erie in Ohio would be east of the Teton Range in\
      \ Wyoming. But wait, I should check the exact longitudes to be sure because\
      \ sometimes states can have varying positions.\n\nLet me recall that longitude\
      \ measures east-west position. The further east a location is, the higher its\
      \ longitude value (if we're talking about west longitude, which the US is in).\
      \ Wait, no, longitude west of the prime meridian is measured in degrees west,\
      \ so higher numerical values going west. For example, New York is around 74\xB0\
      W, whereas Wyoming might be around 110\xB0W. So the Teton Range in Wyoming would\
      \ be at a higher longitude (more west) than Lake Erie. So Lake Erie, being in\
      \ Ohio (around 82\xB0W to 80\xB0W?), would be east of the Teton Range. So yes,\
      \ the answer should be yes. Wait, Ohio's longitude ranges from about 80\xB0\
      W to 84.8\xB0W, depending on the part. Lake Erie is in the northern part of\
      \ Ohio. For example, Cleveland, OH is around 81.6\xB0W. While the Teton Range\
      \ in Wyoming is around 110\xB0W to 111\xB0W. So Cleveland (and Lake Erie) is\
      \ east of the Teton Range because 81.6\xB0W is east of 110\xB0W. Since longitude\
      \ decreases as you go east, so lower numbers are east. Therefore, yes, Lake\
      \ Erie, OH is east of Teton Range, WY.\n</think>YES. Lake Erie, located in Ohio,\
      \ is approximately between 80\xB0W and 82\xB0W longitude. The Teton Range in\
      \ Wyoming lies near 110\xB0W to 111\xB0W longitude. Since lower longitude values\
      \ are farther east in the Western Hemisphere, Lake Erie (e.g., Cleveland, OH\
      \ at ~81.6\xB0W) is east of the Teton Range (~110\xB0W). \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    f061b573-42a1-40b4-983a-cf9d833fddf2: "<think>Alright, let's tackle this question:\
      \ Is Lake Erie, OH located east of Teton Range, WY? Hmm, okay. First, I need\
      \ to figure out where both of these places are in the US. \n\nStarting with\
      \ Lake Erie. I know that Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes\
      \ are in the northeastern part of the United States, bordering Canada. Specifically,\
      \ Lake Erie is between the states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and the Canadian\
      \ province of Ontario. So Lake Erie is in the Midwest/Northeast region, right?\
      \ Ohio is part of the Midwest, but the lake itself is more towards the east,\
      \ near the border with Canada.\n\nNow, the Teton Range in Wyoming. Wyoming is\
      \ a western state, part of the Mountain West region. The Teton Range is a mountain\
      \ range in the Rocky Mountains, located in the northwest part of Wyoming, near\
      \ Idaho. The most famous part is Grand Teton National Park. So the Tetons are\
      \ definitely in the western part of the US.\n\nThe question is whether Lake\
      \ Erie, OH is east of the Teton Range, WY. To determine this, I need to compare\
      \ their longitudinal positions. Longitude measures east-west position. Places\
      \ with higher longitude (more west) are further west, and lower longitude (more\
      \ east) are further east.\n\nI might need to recall or estimate the approximate\
      \ longitudes. Let's think. The Teton Range is in western Wyoming. Wyoming's\
      \ longitude ranges roughly from about 104\xB0W to 111\xB0W. The Teton Range\
      \ is near the western border, so maybe around 110\xB0W to 111\xB0W. For example,\
      \ Jackson Hole, which is near the Tetons, is around 110\xB044'W. \n\nLake Erie's\
      \ longitude: The lake spans from the western end near Toledo, Ohio, which is\
      \ around 83\xB0W, to the eastern end near Buffalo, New York, which is around\
      \ 78\xB0W. So the entire lake is between approximately 78\xB0W and 83\xB0W.\
      \ \n\nComparing the two: The Teton Range is around 110\xB0W, and Lake Erie is\
      \ around 78-83\xB0W. Since lower longitude means further east, Lake Erie is\
      \ east of the Teton Range. For example, 80\xB0W is east of 110\xB0W. So yes,\
      \ Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't\
      \ mix up east and west. If a location has a smaller longitude (closer to 0\xB0\
      ), it's more east. So 80\xB0W is east of 110\xB0W because 80 is less than 110.\
      \ So yes, Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range. Therefore, the answer should\
      \ be YES.\n</think>YES. Lake Erie, located between approximately 78\xB0W and\
      \ 83\xB0W longitude, is east of the Teton Range in Wyoming, which lies near\
      \ 110\xB0W\u2013111\xB0W. Since lower longitude values are farther east, Lake\
      \ Erie is positioned east of the Teton Range. \n\n**Answer:** YES"
    fff9ae4f-8ea2-4f10-842c-b9d3dce1ba66: "<think>Okay, let's see. The question is\
      \ whether Lake Erie in Ohio is located east of the Teton Range in Wyoming. Hmm,\
      \ I need to figure out the positions of both places in the US. \n\nFirst, I\
      \ know that Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes. It's the fourth largest by\
      \ surface area and the southernmost. Ohio borders Lake Erie to the south, so\
      \ the lake is in the northern part of Ohio. Now, where is the Teton Range? That's\
      \ in Wyoming, right? The Teton Range is part of the Rocky Mountains, and I think\
      \ it's in the western part of Wyoming. \n\nSo, to determine if Lake Erie is\
      \ east of the Teton Range, I need to compare their longitudes. Places further\
      \ east have higher longitude values if we're using the western hemisphere where\
      \ the US is, but actually, longitude west of the prime meridian is measured\
      \ in degrees west, so higher longitude west means further west. Wait, no, longitude\
      \ is measured from 0\xB0 at the prime meridian going east to 180\xB0E and west\
      \ to 180\xB0W. But in the US, all longitudes are west, so they're measured as\
      \ degrees west. So a higher degree west (like 120\xB0W) is further west than\
      \ a lower degree west (like 80\xB0W). \n\nSo, Lake Erie's longitude: Ohio is\
      \ in the eastern part of the US. Let me think, Cleveland, Ohio, is on Lake Erie.\
      \ The approximate longitude of Cleveland is around 81.7\xB0W. The Teton Range\
      \ in Wyoming\u2014Jackson Hole is near there, maybe? The longitude for the Teton\
      \ Range is probably around 110\xB0W to 111\xB0W. For example, Jackson, WY is\
      \ about 110.76\xB0W. \n\nComparing 81.7\xB0W (Lake Erie) and 110\xB0W (Teton\
      \ Range), since 81.7 is east of 110, that means Lake Erie is east of the Teton\
      \ Range. Because the lower the longitude (in the western hemisphere), the more\
      \ eastward the location. So yes, Lake Erie is east of the Teton Range.\n\nWait,\
      \ but let me double-check. If a place is at 80\xB0W and another at 110\xB0W,\
      \ the one at 80\xB0W is further east because it's closer to the prime meridian.\
      \ So yes, Lake Erie (around 81\xB0W) is east of Teton Range (around 110\xB0\
      W). Therefore, the answer should be YES.\n</think>YES  \nLake Erie, located\
      \ in the northern part of Ohio, has a longitude around 81\xB0W. The Teton Range\
      \ in Wyoming is situated at approximately 110\xB0W. Since lower western longitudes\
      \ (e.g., 81\xB0W) are farther east than higher ones (e.g., 110\xB0W), Lake Erie\
      \ is indeed east of the Teton Range."
