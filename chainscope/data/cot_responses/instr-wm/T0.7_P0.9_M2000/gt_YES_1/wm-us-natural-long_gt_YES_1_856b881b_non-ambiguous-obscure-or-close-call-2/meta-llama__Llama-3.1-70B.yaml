    115f3a76-08e2-4182-935d-fe4f9eec225c: 'To answer this question,
      we need to determine the relative locations of Lake Erie, OH and Teton Range,
      WY.


      1. **Identify the locations**: Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes, located
      in the northern United States, bordering the state of Ohio. The Teton Range
      is a mountain range in the western United States, located in Wyoming.


      2. **Determine the general geographical direction**: The United States is generally
      divided into eastern and western regions, with the Rocky Mountains serving as
      a rough dividing line.


      3. **Compare the locations**: Lake Erie is in the eastern United States, while
      the Teton Range is in the western United States.


      4. **Conclusion**: Since Lake Erie is in the eastern United States and the Teton
      Range is in the western United States, we can conclude that Lake Erie is located
      east of the Teton Range.


      Therefore, the answer is: **YES**'
